## **1\. Classification of incubation**  

⑴ Batch culture

> ① Grows cells by limiting the amount of culture medium.

>> ○ Growth-limiting substrate **:** Substrates with limited amounts that affects cell growth

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Lag phase

>> ○ In order for microbes to recognize and adapt to new molecules, the number of cells does not increase and the level of internal change is taken.

>> ○ Shortening strategy **:** Adapting to incubation environment before cell culture, Metabolic improvement substance(_e.g._, Mg), Cell factor concentration optimization

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Exponential phase

>> ○ Balanced growth **:** A pattern of growth in which all cells multiply at a certain rate

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Deceleration phase  

>> ○ Unbalanced growth starts.

> ⑤ 4<sup>th</sup>. Stationary phase

>> ○ Useful secondary metabolites such as antibiotics begin to be produced, i.e. non-replicating metabolism begins.

>> ○ As the stage where oxygen and nutrients are insufficient, sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients can delay the stationary phase.

> ⑥ 5<sup>th</sup>. Death phase or decline phase

>> ○ Errors are severe because dead cells are counted during absorbance analysis (using a spectrophotometer).

⑵ Fed-batch culture

> ① Cultivation method that increases productivity of products by adding organic nutrition ingredients only during incubation but not extracting the culture fluid.

>> ○ The volume of culture fluid continuously increases.

>> ○ The continuously supplied nutrient is called 'feed'.

> ② Advantages **:** Overcomes substrates inhibition problem.

>> ○ If E. coli grows at maximum speed using glucose, it will produce organic acids, a by-product, which will inhibit growth. In the fed-batch culture, it is possible to reduce the production of by-products and cultivate highly concentrated E. coli by maintaining the concentration of substrate and maintaining the growth of E. coli properly.

⑶ Chemostat

> ① An open-system culture method that maintains environmental conditions while continuously providing nutrients and removing wastes.

> ② CSTR(continuous stirred-tank reactor model) is generally used for incubator.  

> ③ Parameter

>> ○ Cell density(X) **:** g cells / L

>> ○ Dilution rate **:** F(feed) / V(incubator volume)

>> ○ Productivity of biomass **:** D × X

>> ○ Space time **:** The duration of the reactant's stay in the reactor, V(incubator volume) / F(volume flow)

>> ○ Space velocity **:** Inverse number of space time, Relative velocity concept

⑷ Basic equation

> ① Parameter

>> ○ Biomass yield **:** Indicates how much more cells can multiply per substrate of unit mass.

>>> ○ Unit **:** g cells / g substrates

>>> ○ Generally marked as Y<sub>x/s</sub> 

>> ○ Product yield **:** Indicates how much product per substrate of unit mass can be produced.

>>> ○ Unit **:** g products / g substrates

>>> ○ Generally marked as Y<sub>p/s</sub> 

>> ○ Production speed **:** The rate of formation of acellular products, and the rate of formation of products per cell of unit mass

>>> ○ Unit **:** g products / g cells · h

>>> ○ Generally marked as q<sub>p</sub>

> ② Biomass's rate of change equation

> ⑤ Monod equation **:** Well applied when cell concentration is low.

>> ○ Similar to Michaelis-Menten formula.

>> ○ Residual substrate concentration(S) is independent of the incoming substrate concentration(S0).

> ⑥ Contois equation

>> ○ Developed from Monod equation.

>> ○ Residual substrate concentration(S) is independent of the incoming substrate concentration(S0).

⑸ Cell recycle **:** If there is cell recycle in a chemostat, dilution rate can be greater than the specific growth rate.

> ① General phenomenon **:** μ = D

> ② μ<sub>m</sub> < D **:** Generally cells continue to escape.

> ③ Proof

## **2. Biofuel process**

⑴ Conducted in the order of pre-treatment, saccharification, and fermentation.  

> ① Example of pre-treatment **:** Cellulase and hemicellulase production.

> ② Example of saccharification **:** Hydrolysis that converts cellulose and hemicellulose into monomer sugars.

> ③ Example of fermentation **:** Fermentation of hexose and pentose.

⑵ SHF(separate hydrolysis and fermentation)

> ① Traditional process consisting of 1st stage(pre-treatment, saccharification) and 2nd stage(fermentation).

> ② Advantage **:** Since each stage is executed under optimal conditions, it is executed without the cleaning pre-treated biomass, eliminating poison and supplying nutrients. 

⑶ SSF(simultaneous saccharification and fermentation)

> ① Process in which the preparation phase occurs first and the fermentation takes place simultaneously with saccharification.

> ② **Advantage 1.** Biomass hydrolysis rate is high due to removal of final product inhibition.

> ③ **Advantage 2.** Cleaning pre-treated materials improves biomass conversion rate due to removal of inhibitory mixtures.

> ④ **Advantage 3.** Use of heat-resistant yeast is permitted.

⑷ CBP(consolidated bio-processing)

> ① The pre-treatment, saccharification and fermentation are treated as a single process.

> ② Advantage **:** Provides low cost, high efficiency potential for biomass decomposition enzyme production.
