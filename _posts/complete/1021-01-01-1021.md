**Figure 1. Classification Based on Oxygen Requirements and Resistance**

<br>

>> ○ A. Obligate Aerobe: Can only perform aerobic respiration, cannot perform fermentation or anaerobic respiration.

>> ○ B. Facultative: Microorganisms that can adapt their metabolism to both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

>>> ○ Example: Yeast

>> ○ C. Aerotolerant: Can remove active oxygen like A, B, and E, but cannot perform aerobic respiration.

>> ○ D. Obligate Anaerobe: Suffers lethal damage from oxygen.

>>> ○ Mostly methanogens and acetogens.

>>> ○ Methanogens and acetogens compete using carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with methanogens having an advantage.

 **Figure 6.** Types of viruses

<br>

 ⑸ Bacteriophage: Has a life cycle of about 30 minutes

> ① Lytic Cycle: Pathogenic viruses like T1, T2, T4 phages (DNA viruses)

>> ○ 1st. Attachment: Tail attaches to the host cell surface

>> ○ 2nd. Entry: Phage action immediately halts host replication, transcription, and translation

>> ○ 3rd. Replication: Early genes expressed → Induction of late gene transcription → Expression of late genes

>>> ○ Early genes: genes that determine the phage lifecycle and degrade the host DNA by hydrolyzing the host chromosome entirely to utilize it for viral DNA synthesis

>>> ○ Late genes: Capsid genes, lysis genes

>> ○ 4th. Assembly: Virus DNA replication using host enzymes. Produced virus proteins cut and degrade host DNA

>> ○ 5th. Release: Cell membrane lytic enzyme produced by phage leads to release

> ② Lysogenic Cycle: Temperate phages like λ phage (DNA viruses)

>> ○ 1st. Attachment

>> ○ 2nd. Entry: Upon insertion into bacteria, linear DNA becomes circular

>> ○ 3rd. Replication: Unlike the lytic cycle, phage DNA integrates into host DNA

>>> ○ Prophage: Phage DNA integrated into host DNA

>> ○ 4th. Assembly and Release: Original phage DNA remains in the host

>> ○ 5th. Switches to lytic cycle if host replication is hindered

>>> ○ More cI factor results in lysogenic cycle, while more cro factor results in lytic cycle

>>> ○ **Memory tip:** I.. in.. O.. out..

>>> ○ In healthy E. coli, phages first synthesize cro, later influenced by cI protein, leading to lysogenic cycle

> ③ Competitive Expression of cro and cI

 **Figure 7.** Gene Expression in Lytic and Lysogenic Cycles]

>> ○ Gene expression in lytic and lysogenic cycles regulated by two genes (cI, cro) and three promoters (PR, PL, PRM)

>> ○ Gene expression pattern in lytic cycle

>>> ○ 1st - 3rd. Forming DNA loop between OR1-OL1, OR2-OL2, OR3-OL3 with a repressor in between

>>> ○ 1st - 4th. DNA loop promotes transcription of cI gene

>>> ○ 1st - 5th. As cI expression increases due to competitive gene expression of cro and cI, lysogenic growth is induced

>> ○ 2nd. Establishment of Lysogeny

>>> ○ The cI gene is transcribed from the PRE promoter during the establishment of lysogeny, and from the PRM promoter to maintain lysogeny.

>>> ○ λ repressor binding to OR1 and OR2 also promotes the establishment of lysogeny

>>> ○ PR and cII influence the establishment of lysogeny

>>> ○ PL, which regulates lytic genes, also influences the establishment of lysogeny

> ⑤ Induction of Lysogeny

>> ○ The λ repressor protein is shaped like a dumbbell, with its N-terminal and C-terminal regions located at opposite ends.

>> ○ λ repressor monomers form dimers, and dimers combine to form tetramers

>> ○ UV light induces monomer formation of λ repressor, inhibiting cI expression

>> ○ As cro expression increases relatively due to competitive gene expression of cro and cI, lytic growth is induced
