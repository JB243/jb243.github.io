## **1\. Bioinformatics Consortium**

⑴ **[Genome Project](https://jb243.github.io/pages/75)**

> ① Started in 1990 under the leadership of Watson and Francis Collins: Launched as a 15-year project by a consortium of six countries

> ② Collaborative research by over 350 research institutions

>> ○ June 2000: 84.5% completed, draft published

>> ○ April 15, 2003: Final version published with 99.99% accuracy

>> ○ Over 2,800 researchers participated over 13 years, costing $2.7 billion

> ③ Side effects of human genome research

>> ○ Birth of [bioinformatics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/75)

>> ○ Accelerated the development of human protein production processes

>>> ○ Insulin: The first protein to have its sequence determined

>> ○ Promoted the development of automated sequencing equipment

>> ○ Stimulated genome analysis of other biologically significant organisms

> ④ Scientists vs Entrepreneurs

>> ○ Scientists: The Human Genome Project (HGP). Watson and Francis Collins. Final cost: $2.7 billion

>> ○ Entrepreneurs: Celera Genomics (started in 1998). Craig Venter. Final cost: $300 million

>> ○ Both groups published their human genome drafts in 2001

>> ○ Scientists were dissatisfied with entrepreneurs taking credit for their work and investments

>> ○ Entrepreneurs were frustrated with scientists for withholding information → Led to new methodologies

>> ○ Final completion of the genome map was acknowledged as a joint achievement

⑵ **ENCODE Project**

> ① Timeline: Draft in 2001 → In 2003, NHGRI launched the ENCODE project to identify all functional elements in the human genome

> ② Phase I: 1% of genome. Completed in 2007

> ③ Phase II: Build-out phase. Completed in 2012

>> ○ Version 7 (December 2010)

>>> ○ 51,082 genes: 161,375 transcripts

>>> ○ 20,687 protein-coding genes: 76,052 transcripts

>>> ○ 9,640 lncRNAs: 15,512 transcripts

> ④ Phase III: Production phase. Completed in 2016

> ⑤ Phase IV: Started in 2016-2017

>> ○ Version 29 (May 2018)

>>> ○ 58,721 genes: 206,694 transcripts

>>> ○ 19,940 protein-coding genes: 83,129 transcripts

>>> ○ 16,066 lncRNAs: 29,566 transcripts

>> ○ Version 36 (May 2020)

>>> ○ 60,660 genes: 232,117 transcripts

>>> ○ 19,962 protein-coding genes: 85,269 transcripts

>>> ○ 17,958 lncRNAs: 48,734 transcripts

⑶ **1000 Genome Project**

> ① Sequenced the whole genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 global populations, identifying over 88 million genetic variations

> ② A typical genome differs from the reference human genome at 4.09 million to 5.02 million sites, affecting approximately 20 million bases

## **2\. Data Growth Rate**

<br>

| data phase | astronomy | Twitter | YouTube | genomics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| acquisition | 25 zetta-bytes/yr | 0.5-15 billion tweets/yr | 500-900 million hrs/yr | 1 zetta-bases/yr |
| storage | 1 EB/yr | 1-17 PB/yr | 1-2 EB/yr | 2-40 EB/yr |
| analysis | in situ data reduction | topic and sentiment mining | limited requirements | heterogeneous data and analysis |
|   | real-time processing | metadata analysis |   | variant calling, ~2 trillion central processing unit (CPU) hours |
|   | massive volumes |   |   |   |
| distribution | dedicated lines from antennae to server (600 TB/s) | small units of distribution | major component of modern user's bandwidth (10 MB/s) | many small (10 MB/s) and fewer massive (10 TB/s) data movement |
