## **1. Overview**

⑴ Definition

> ① Signal: Refers to a sequence {x(tn)} when t1, ..., tn (e.g., time) are given.

> ② Signal Processing: Extracting information from a signal.

> ③ Signal Preprocessing: Refining a clean signal by removing noise or trend components from raw data.

⑵ Types of Signals

> ① **Type 1.** Continuous Signal: A signal where both t and x are continuous.

>> ○ Storage, acquisition, and processing are extremely difficult.

>> ○ Example: To store, acquire, and process the irrational number π, infinite capacity and time are required.

> ② **Type 2.** Discrete Signal: A signal where t is discrete, and x is continuous.

> ③ **Type 3.** Digital Signal: A signal where both t and x are discrete.

> ④ Sampling (digitization): Converting continuous signals into discrete signals.

> ⑤ Nyquist Theorem: If the sampling rate is more than twice the signal frequency, it can be sampled without aliasing error.

⑶ Signals can have more than two dimensions.

> ① 2D Signal: Defined as an image when the dimension of t is 2.

> ② 3D Signal: For example, coronary angiogram.

> ③ 4D Signal: For example, radiotherapy in cancer.

⑷ Time, as a domain, can be transformed in infinitely different ways (e.g., Fourier Transform, converting time to days of the week).

## **2. Transformation**

⑴ Overview: There are infinitely many ways to transform signals.

⑵ **Fourier Transformation**

> ① Definition: A representative method to obtain frequency information from a time-domain signal.

> ② When a signal x(t) is given in the time domain, the transformed frequency-domain signal X(f) has the following relationship:

<br>

>> ○ Notation: X(f) = F{x(t)}

>> ○ Fourier Transform is a special case of the [Laplace Transform](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1910).

>> ○ [Proof of the Relationship Between Fourier Transform and Its Inverse](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2879051/inverse-fourier-transform-of-the-fourier-transform).

> ③ Properties of Fourier Transform

>> ○ **Property 1.** Linearity: F{ax1(t) + bx2(t)} = aF{x1(t)} + bF{x2(t)} = aX1(f) + bX2(f).

>>> ○ Linearity = proportionality + superposition.

>>> ○ While all systems are fundamentally nonlinear, they satisfy quasi-linearity in micro-intervals.

>> ○ **Property 2.** Scaling: F{x(at)} = (1/a) × X(f/a). Related to the uncertainty principle.

>> ○ **Property 3.** Shifting: F{x(t - a)} = X(f) exp(-j 2πaf).

>>> ○ **∴** |F{x(t - a)}| = |X(f)|.

>>> ○ Meaning of phase: Indicates when the signal starts, but it is difficult to interpret, so only the magnitude is usually considered.

>> ○ **Property 4.** Convolution

>>> ○ x1(t) ⨂ x2(t) = ∫ x1(t) x2(t - τ) dτ = ∫ x1(t - τ) x2(τ) dτ by definition.

>>> ○ F{x1(t) ⨂ x2(t)} = F{x1(t)} · F{x2(t)} = X1(f) · X2(f).

>> ○ **Property 5.** If x(t) is a real function, F{x(-t)} = X*(f) holds (where X* is the complex conjugate of X).

## **3. Nyquist Theorem**

⑴ Aliasing Artifact: Distortion occurring when the sampling frequency is lower than the signal frequency during sampling.

<br>

**Figure 4.** Aliasing Artifact.

<br>

⑵ Nyquist Theorem: For perfect reconstruction of a signal, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the maximum frequency of the signal.

⑶ Proof of Nyquist Theorem:

> ① Assume a signal x(t) and its Fourier transform X(f) are given. Define the maximum value of X(f) as fm.

<br>

> ② Assume a transformation function H(t), which is 1 at regular time intervals (Ts) and 0 elsewhere, and its Fourier transform H(f).

**Figure 6.** H(t) and H(f).

<br>

> ③ Multiplying x(t) with H(t) at each time is equivalent to sampling x(t) at points where H(t) = 1.

> ④ Over-Sampling: When the sampling frequency is set faster than the signal frequency. **X(f) appears at intervals of fs = 1 / Ts**.

**Figure 12.** Band-Stop Filter.

⑵ **Digital Filter Circuits**

> ① **FIR Filter**

>> ○ Convolution

>>> For raw data {xn}, processed data {yn} is expressed as:

>>>> yn = b0xn + b1xn-1 + ... + bMxn-M = ∑ bkxn-k (where k = 0, 1, ..., M).

>>> Here, bk is called a parameter or coefficient. Additionally:

>>>> δ(x) = 0, if x ≠ 0  

>>>> δ(x) = 1, if x = 0  

>>> The unit impulse function δ(x) satisfies:

>>>> hn = ∑ bkδ(n-k) (where k = 0, 1, ..., M) = bn, if n = 0, 1, ..., M  

>>>> hn = ∑ bkδ(n-k) (where k = 0, 1, ..., M) = 0, otherwise  

>>>> yn = ∑ bkxn-k (where k = 0, 1, ..., M) = ∑ hkxn-k (where k = -∞, ..., ∞) = hn * xn = xn * hn  

>>> Hence, yn is the convolution of hn and xn.

>> ○ Frequency Response

>>> All functions can be expressed as infinite sums of trigonometric functions.  

>>> For an arbitrary angular frequency ω, -∞ < n < ∞, xn = Aejφejωn holds. ([ref](http://nate9389.tistory.com/34))  

>>> For k = 0, 1, ..., M, yn is expressed as:

>>>> yn = ∑ bkxn-k = ∑ bke-jωkAejφejωn = ( ∑ bke-jωk ) xn = H(ejω)xn  

>>> H(ejω) is called the frequency response of the FIR system and is a function of ω.  

>>> yn can be further expressed as:

>>>> yn = |frequency response| e^(∠frequency response) xn  

>>> Thus, the amplitude of the raw data is scaled by |frequency response|, and the phase changes by ∠frequency response.  

>>> FIR filters allow for linear phase shifts, enabling phase correction.  

>>> FIR filters are particularly used in RF fields where phase information is crucial or in control applications requiring added user logic.

>> ○ Example **:** Low-Pass Filter

>>> If {bk} = {1, 2, 1}, i.e., yn = xn + 2xn-1 + xn-2:

>>>> H(ejω) = ∑ bke-jωk (where k = 0, 1, ..., M) = 1 + 2e-jω + e-2jω = (2 + 2cosω)e-jω.  

>>> |frequency response| = 2 + 2cosω, resulting in a low-pass filter.

>> ○ Z Transformation

>>> FIR filters are designed by analyzing system characteristics and stability using Z transformation to determine poles and zeros.

> ② **IIR Filter**

>> IIR filters define processed data {yn} as:

>>> yn = ∑ bixn-i (where i = 0, 1, ..., M) + ∑ ajyn-j (where j = 1, ..., N).  

>> Like FIR filters, IIR filters determine frequency characteristics through frequency response.  

>> Z transformation is used to analyze poles and zeros to design the system.  

>> IIR systems are computationally complex and challenging to design, with nonlinear phase shifts that make phase restoration impossible.  

>> IIR filters are not used in RF communications, where phase information is critical, but they allow for more ideal amplitude characteristics.

>>> ○ n **:** Filter order.  

>>> ○ ε **:** Ripple size in the pass-band.  

>>> ○ Tn **:** nth-order Chebyshev polynomial.

>> ○ Advantage **:** Steep roll-off rate, beneficial for frequency preservation.  

>> ○ Disadvantage **:** Pass-band or stop-band may experience damping.

> ④ **Elliptic Filter**

>> ○ Advantage **:** Best phase response.  

>> ○ Disadvantage **:** Weakest roll-off rate.

> ⑥ **Median Filter**

>> ○ Non-linear filter, smoothing filter.  

>> ○ Unlike low-pass filters, which cause edge blurring during noise removal, median filters avoid blurring.  

>> ○ Reason **:** Uses the median instead of the mean.

> ⑦ **High-Boost Filter (HBF)**

>> ○ Linear filter. Can also be implemented as a passive filter. Sharpening filter.  

>> ○ HBF = (A - 1) × original + high-pass.

> ⑧ **Derivative Filter**

>> ○ Linear filter. Can also be implemented as a passive filter. Sharpening filter.  

>> ○ Types **:** Roberts mask, Prewitt mask, Sobel mask.
