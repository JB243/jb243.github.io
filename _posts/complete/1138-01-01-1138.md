## **1. Overview**

⑴ Meaning of Artificial Intelligence

> ① **Data Science ⊃ Artificial Intelligence ⊃ Machine Learning ⊃ Artificial Neural Networks ⊃ Deep Learning**

>> ○ Artificial Intelligence (AI): A broad concept referring to computer intelligence that mimics human thinking.

>> ○ Machine Learning: A technique that creates models suitable for solving problems by learning from data.

>>> ○ First defined by Arthur Samuel in 1959.

>>> ○ Examples: [SVM](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2161), [adaboost](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2161#:37.-,AdaBoost,-38), ANN

>> ○ Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): A machine learning algorithm modeled after human neural networks.

>>> ○ **Advantage 1.** Can be trained on tasks difficult to specify concretely.

>>> ○ **Advantage 2.** Can compress a large amount of information ([Autoencoder](https://jb243.github.io/pages/956)).

>> ○ Deep Learning: Artificial neural networks with deep multi-layered structures.

>>> ○ Differs from other machine learning techniques in that features are defined by the computer rather than humans.

>>> ○ Recently shows superior performance compared to most traditional machine learning methods in various fields.

> ② Strong AI vs. Weak AI

> ③ Turing Test

>> ○ A computer passes the test if a human converses with it for 5 minutes without realizing it is a machine.

>> ○ Invented by Alan Turing in 1950.

⑵ Definition of Deep Learning

> ① Mathematical Formulation: A DNN (Deep Neural Network) can be expressed with the following formula:

>> ○ y<sub>n</sub> = f(x<sub>n-1</sub> · w<sub>i</sub>) + b

>> ○ y<sub>n</sub>: Output vector of neurons in the n-th hidden layer.

>> ○ x<sub>n-1</sub>: Output vector of neurons in the (n-1)-th hidden layer.

>> ○ w<sub>i</sub>: Weight vector of neuron i.

>> ○ b: Bias vector.

>> ○ f: Activation function.

> ② Dimension: Refers to the size of the vector. For example, the dimension of **v** = (a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>) is n.

> ③ Inputs: Represented as input vectors of data provided as input, expressed as **x** = (x<sub>1</sub>, ···, x<sub>ℓ</sub>).

> ④ Weights: Weights connecting node i and node j, represented as ω<sub>ij</sub>.

>> ○ Represent synapses of the brain in neural networks; ω<sub>ij</sub> form the matrix **W**.

> ⑤ Outputs: **y** = (y<sub>1</sub>, ···, y<sub>n</sub>) = **y**(**x**, **W**).

> ⑥ Targets: **t** = (t<sub>1</sub>, ···, t<sub>n</sub>), essential for supervised learning algorithms as they require true values for training.

> ⑦ Activation Function g(·): Determines neuron activation based on weighted input values.

>> ○ Threshold Function.

> ⑧ Error: Calculates the distance between the algorithm's output (**y**) and the actual target value (**t**) through errors.

> ⑨ Parameters and Hyperparameters

>> ○ Parameters are measured or learned from data.

>> ○ Parameters are often stored as part of the learned model.

>> ○ Hyperparameters are values arbitrarily set for learning.

>> ○ Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, tree depth in decision trees, and the number of hidden layers in neural networks.

⑶ Characteristics of DNNs

> ① Approximation of nonlinear transformations.

> ② Various hidden layers.

> ③ [Deep Learning Feed Forward](https://blog.naver.com/beyondlegend/221373971859): Operations proceed from input layer → hidden layer → output layer without backward feedback loops.

> ④ Backward Learning: Network weights are updated in reverse order, from output layer → hidden layer.

⑷ Feature Selection

> ① Fewer features reduce computational complexity and the risk of overfitting.

> ② **Method 1.** Selection using domain knowledge.

> ③ **Method 2.** Reduction via feature combination: PCA, etc.

> ④ **Method 3.** Selection via criteria/ranking systems.

>> ○ Filter-based method: Selects features based on statistical criteria. Fast and simple, advantageous for large datasets.

>> ○ Wrapper-based method: Finds optimal feature combinations by training the model multiple times. Computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.

> ⑤ **Method 4.** The method of converting a categorical variable to a continuous variable

>> ○ Score-Function (SF) 

>> ○ DARN

>> ○ MuProp

>> ○ Straight-Through (ST)

>> ○ Slope-Annealed ST

>> ○ Gumbel-Softmax 

>> ○ ST Gumbel-Softmax 

⑸ Example: Applying deep learning models to MNIST (handwritten digit) data.

<br>

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize the pixel values of the images to be between 0 and 1
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# Define a simple sequential model
def create_model():
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),  # Flatten the 2D image to a 1D array
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # First hidden layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation
        layers.Dropout(0.2),                   # Dropout layer to reduce overfitting
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer with 10 neurons for 10 classes and softmax activation
    ])
    return model

# Create the model
model = create_model()

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)

print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')
```

⑹ Types

> ① **Type 1. Supervised Learning**

>> ○ Definition: Learning a map x → y from a problem-answer pair {(**x**<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)}.

>> ○ Examples: Conditional probability, regression functions, supervised classification.

>> ○ **1-1. Semi-supervised Learning**

>>> ○ Similar to supervised learning but only some answers are labeled.

>> ○ **1-2. Imitation Learning**

>>> ○ While supervised learning learns the relationship between inputs and outputs, imitation learning uses other example data to learn this relationship.

>> ○ **1-3. Meta Learning**

>>> ○ Learns the results or learning process of other machine learning algorithms.

> ② **Type 2. Unsupervised Learning**

>> ○ Definition: Understanding the underlying structure of a feature vector **x** provided without labels.

>> ○ Examples: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, topic modeling, [DIP](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2164) (deep image prior), style transfer.

>> ○ The difference from Prior Learning

>>> ○ Typical CNN neural networks undergo prior learning with large datasets to create prediction models.

>> ○ Prior learning is necessary when training/prediction happens simultaneously.

>>> ○ On the other hand, methods like DIP work in a self-taught manner and do not require prior learning.

> ③ **Type 3. Reinforcement Learning**

>> ○ Definition: A method that learns the best action in each state based on rewards (π(action | state)) given for actions taken under specific conditions.

>> ○ Clues to the correct answer are implicitly provided in the form of rewards.

> ④ **Type 4. Self-supervised Learning**

>> ○ Definition: Machine learning that proceeds by creating problems and answer sheets independently, like a toy example.

>> ○ Similarities with supervised learning: Differentiates between test/training datasets.

>> ○ Similarities with unsupervised learning: The model generates the answer sheet.

>> ○ **4-1. Auto-associative Learning**: Also known as [autoencoder](https://jb243.github.io/pages/956).

>>> ○ Definition: A neural network that compresses input data as much as possible and then restores the compressed data to its original form.

>>>> ○ Encoder: Neural network from the input layer to the hidden layer.

>>>> ○ Decoder: Neural network from the hidden layer to the output layer.

>>>> ○ Encoders and decoders are trained together.

>>> ○ **Effect 1.** Data Compression: If the hidden layer has fewer nodes than the input layer, the network can compress the input data.

>>> ○ **Effect 2.** Data Abstraction: Converts complex data into multidimensional vectors, enabling classification and recombination of input data.

>>>> ○ These multidimensional vectors are also called hidden layers or features.

>>>> ○ PCA is a representative recombination algorithm.

>> ○ **4-2. Masking-based**

>>> ○ Example: iBOT (masking + distillation).

>> ○ **4-3. Distillation-based**

>>> ○ Example: DINO (distillation), iBOT (masking + distillation).

>> ○ **4-4. Contrastive Learning**

>>> ○ Definition: A method of learning by comparing target data with control data.

>>> ○ Applies information theory's [surprisal](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2145#:-,uncertainty,-\(surprisalunexpectednessrandomness)) to define loss functions as: $-(1/N) × (Σ log Φ_target + Σ log (1-Φ_control))$, where Φ is a probability.

>>> ○ Examples: SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL.

>> ○ **4-5. Foundation Model**

>>> ○ Definition: A machine learning model operating in an inductive way, necessarily self-supervised.

>>> ○ Inductive way: The ability to infer (e.g., knowing "apple" is 사과 and "banana" is 바나나, one can guess "melon" is 멜론).

>>> ○ Difference with Generative Model: Generative model refers to models that create new example data.

>>> ○ Foundation models may or may not be generative.

>>> ○ [DIP](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2164) (deep image prior) is a generative model but not a foundation model because it does not work in an inductive way.

>>> ○ Foundation models are categorized as LLM, LMM, and diffusion models.

>>> ○ **Paradigm Shift:** Machine Learning (2000s, feature-centric) → Deep Learning (2010s, model-centric) → Foundation Model (2020s, data-centric).

>> ○ **4-6. Transfer Learning**

>>> ○ Algorithms that retrain a learned model by modifying its final output layer.

>>> ○ Allows the application of pretrained models to new tasks different from the originally intended task (e.g., [Geneformer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06139-9)).

>>> ○ It does not necessarily have to be a self-supervised learning approach; for example, [Step2Heart](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12121) implemented using supervised learning.

>>> ○ Requires self-supervised learning to operate inductively for different tasks.
