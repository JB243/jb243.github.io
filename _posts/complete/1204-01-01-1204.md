## **1\. 1<sup>st</sup>. The formation of neural tube**

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Zygote becomes embryonic disc which consists of 3 germinal layers(endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) through "cleavage".

⑵ 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. In the ectoderm, neurectoderm becomes thicker so that neurectoderm forms special cellular layers called "neural plate".

⑶ 1<sup>st</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Diverticulation : Between neural plate and other ectoderm, there appears a protruded structure called "neural crest". (**A**)

> ① Neural crest : The tissue which differentiates from neurectoderm and doesn't participate in constructing the neural plate.

>> ○ Examples: cranial meninges, spinal meninges, etc.

⑷ 1<sup>st</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. Both lateral sides of neural plate becomes more crested, and there appears "neural groove". (**B**)

⑸ 1<sup>st</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup>. Both sides of neural crest regions meet and fuse, beginning at the midline and progressing toward the margins; later, all portions—except the rostral (cranial) and caudal ends—unite to form the "neural tube". (**C**)

> ① Anterior neuropore : The entrance of the neural tube at the head

> ② Posterior neuropore : The entrance of the neural tube at the tail

<center>23 days image after fertilization. 1-2 days later, neuropores are closed.</center>

<br>

⑹ 1<sup>st</sup> - 6<sup>th</sup>. The neural tube soon closes at both openings (the anterior and posterior neuropores); the lumen of this tube is called the central canal.

> ① Notochord: a structure that, during development, induces neural tube closure.

> ② If closure fails, anencephaly or spina bifida can result.

⑺ 1<sup>st</sup> - 7<sup>th</sup>. Cells around the neural crest spread out and some of those cells make spinal ganglion. (**D**)

<br>

<br>

## **2\. 2<sup>nd</sup>. The cell proliferation of the neural tube**  

⑴ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Initially the total wall of the neural tube consists of a few layers of cells.

⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Cellular layers at the wall of the neural tube becomes thicker by cell proliferation.

⑶ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. These cellular layers form the "mantle layer", and the cells differentiate into neurons later.

⑷ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. The neural fibers of the cells at the mantle layer extend and form the "marginal layer".

⑸ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup>. At the innermost portion of the neural tube, adjacent to the central canal, a neuroepithelial layer forms; later it differentiates into the "ependymal layer".

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dMj1Cs/btrzYUzatC5/WiOKnXeEliLdl846DjRjf0/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 3.</b> The proliferation, migration, and differentiation of the cells of the primitive neural tube</center>

<br>

⑹ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 6<sup>th</sup>. In the mantle layer, the ventral neurons (in the basal plate) become motor neurons, and the dorsal neurons (in the alar plate) become sensory neurons.

⑺ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 7<sup>th</sup>. The induced structure of the neural tube

> ① Spinal Cord  

>> ○ Alar Plate : Posterior Horn (Sensory Nuclei)

>> ○ Basal Plate : Anterior Horn (Motor Nuclei)

> ② Medulla Oblongata  

>> ○ Alar Plate : General Somatic Afferent, Special Somatic Afferent, Visceral Afferent  

>> ○ Basal Plate : General Somatic Efferent, Special Somatic Efferent, General Visceral Efferent  

> ③ Pons  

>> ○ Alar Plate : Tectal Structure  

>> ○ Basal Plate : Tegmentum(Central Tegmental Tract, Trapezoid Body), Basis Pontis(Griseum Pontis, Transverse Pontine Fiber, Corticospinal Tract)  

> ④ Midbrain (Mesencephalon)

>> ○ Alar Plate : Tectum  

>> ○ Basal Plate : Cerebral Peduncle(Red Nucleus, Substantia Nigra, Crus Cerebri)  

> ⑤ Diencephalon  

>> ○ Sulcus Limitans : Hypothalamic Sulcus  

>> ○ Alar Plate : Dorsal Thalamus  

>> ○ Basal Plate : Hypothalamus, Subthalamus, Zona Incerta

## **3\. 3<sup>rd</sup>. The formation and differentiation of the brain vesicle** 

⑴ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. The neural tube is divided into 3 brain vesicles: "prosencephalon", "mesencephalon", and "rhombencephalon"

⑵ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Prosencephalon: It differentiates into "telencephalon", "diencephalon", etc.

> ① Telencephalon : It differentiates into "cerebral hemisphere", basal ganglia, etc.  

>> ○ Basal ganglia : It differentiates into "corpus striatum", "amygdala", etc.  

> ② Diencephalon : It differentiates into "thalamus", etc.  

>> ○ Characteristics : It makes up the "limbic system".  

>> ○ Thalamus differentiates into "dorsal thalamus", "epithalamus", "hypothalamus", "subthalamus", "metathalamus", etc.

⑶ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Mesencephalon: It differentiates into midbrain.

> ① **Characteristics 1.** All the animal has it.

> ② **Characteristics 2.** The higher intelligence the entity has, the relatively smaller size mesencephalon has.

⑷ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. Rhombencephalon: It differentiates into "metencephalon", "myelencephalon", etc.  

> ① **Characteristics:** The higher intelligence the entity has, the more developed rhombencephalon is.  

> ② Metencephalon: It differentiates into "cerebellum", "pons", etc.

> ③ Myelencephalon: It differentiates into "medulla oblongata", etc.

⑸ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup>. Spinal cord: It has very slight change after embryo.

## **4\. 4<sup>th</sup>. The development of the primitive brain**  

⑴ 4<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. The flexure formation

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/c5E6Kl/btrz4PJnOAx/Wz7c21Ik28Efpa6kc7Ljfk/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

 <center><b>Figure. 7.</b> The process of modification of brain</center>

 <br>

⑶ 4<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. The external form of the brain is completed within 8 weeks after fertilization. But it is not more than a water bag.

<br>

<br>

## **5\. 5<sup>th</sup>. The change of the wall of the neural tube (medulla oblongata)**

⑴ 5<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. The migration of the mantle layer and the marginal layer is observed "only" in medulla oblongata.

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/Xjgoi/btrz4NY8m3Y/5nqxIPG6jR4FGhcEAdbtpK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 9.</b> The cross section of the midbrain</center>

<br>

⑵ 5<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. In the medulla oblongata, the acellular ventricular wall gapes in a serrated (saw-toothed) pattern.

<br>

<br>
  
## **6 6<sup>th</sup>. The change of the wall of the neural tube (cerebellum, cerebrum)** 

⑴ The explanation focuses on the cerebellar process. This process generates the cortex structure(e.g., gyri, sulci)

⑵ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Proliferation: Granule cells, a type of neuron, proliferate in the mantle layer.

⑶ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Migration: Half of the proliferated cells migrate toward the cortex.

> ① In practice, fewer than half migrate because mantle-layer cells must also give rise to glia; therefore, the "half" holds only if mantle-layer cells proliferate exclusively into migratory cells.

> ② 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Radial glial fibers guide the cells so they migrate in a straight path.

> ③ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Granule cells move to just beneath the cerebellar cortex, forming a new layer of gray matter called the external granular layer (EGL). (**B**, **C**)  

> ④ 6<sup>th</sup>–2<sup>nd</sup>–3<sup>rd</sup>. The granule cells that constituted the external granular layer migrate somewhat inward.

>> ○ Mechanism for the molecular layer: this creates a sparsely cellular layer at the outermost cortex.

> ⑤ 6<sup>th</sup>–2<sup>nd</sup>–4<sup>th</sup>. At the same time, Purkinje cells are generated and migrate to a outer position superficial to the granule layer (**B**, **C**).

> ⑥ Inside-out phenomenon: During development of the cerebellum and cerebrum, cells that migrate later end up more superficial (outer) than those that migrate earlier; in other words, the outermost cells are the last to be generated.

>> ○ Reason: later-migrating cells pass earlier ones and can form cell–cell connections in the process.

>> ○ Additional note: once all connections are formed, unnecessary ones can be pruned.

>> ○ Approximate proportions: radial migration ~80%, tangential migration ~20%.

⑷ 6<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Differentiation : The granule cells, the purkinje cells, and the mantle layer cells differentiate in place, and the mantle layer cells become "deep cerebellar nuclei". (**D**)  

> ① 6<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. The migrating cells are small and lean so that they are optimized in migrating, so the migrated cells are larger than the migrating cells about 10 times.

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ytxIl/btrzZMmEpJA/MAVCs2jiXqFTK3UDA09dc0/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 10.</b> The process diagram of the embryonic cerebellum</center>

<br>

⑸ 6<sup>th</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. Like above, the structures of both the cerebellum and the cerebrum become 'basal ganglia' → 'medulla' → 'cortex'. 

> ① That is, nerve cell body - neural fiber(axon) - nerve cell body.

> ② That is, gray matter - white matter - gray matter.  

> ③ In the spinal cord, the mantle (intermediate) zone is gray matter, and the marginal zone is white matter.

⑹ The proliferation is ventricle-specific and the migration is CNS-specific.

<br>

<br>

## **7\. 7<sup>th</sup>. The partial expansion of the neural tube**

⑴ As the lumen of the neural tube (the central canal) expands locally, it forms the various ventricles in different regions.

> ① Choroid Plexus : It secretes CSF(Cerebrospinal Fluid).  

> ② CSF : It flows through Lateral Ventricle → 3<sup>rd</sup> Ventricle → 4<sup>th</sup> Ventricle.

<br>

<b>Figure 12.</b> The cross section of the embryonic brain focusing on vesicles

<br>

⑵ Spinal cord: The lumen retains its embryonic shape and is called the central canal.

⑶ Medulla oblongata and pons: The lumen is markedly expanded and is called the fourth ventricle.

⑷ Midbrain: The lumen largely retains its original configuration and is called the cerebral aqueduct.

⑸ Diencephalon: The lumen is expanded and singular in the median plane, called the third ventricle.

⑹ Telencephalon: The lumen is expanded, with one in each cerebral hemisphere, called the lateral ventricles.

⑺ Interventricular foramen: The third ventricle and the lateral ventricles are connected via the interventricular foramen.

⑻ Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): The fluid that flows through the central canal and all ventricles.

## 8. The maturation of the nervous system

⑴ Proliferative phase: up to about two-thirds of fetal development

> ① Cell number increases to roughly 28 billion, with more than 10 billion concentrated in the brain.

⑵ Rapid growth phase: until 2 months after birth

> ① Rapid development of dendrites and axons; formation of basic synapses

> ② At birth: about 24% of adult brain size

> ③ Chimpanzee: 60% of adult size at birth; development ceases within the first year.

⑶ By 2 years after birth

> ① Basic networks are in place, preparing for learning

> ② Cell growth and network expansion proceed according to learning and experience.

⑷ Age 6

> ① About 95% of adult brain size

> ② Brain-cell growth continues until approximately 16–18 years of age.

⑸ After age 18

> ① Around 50,000 brain cells are lost per day.

⑹ Senile dementia

> ① Inability to form new networks; disruption of existing connectivity.
