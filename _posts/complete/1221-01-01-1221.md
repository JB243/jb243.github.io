## **1. Overview**

⑴ sampling

> ① with-replacement**:** re-injecting and extracting something already extracted

> ② without-replacement**:** extracting without re-injecting what has already been extracted.

⑵ types of number of cases

## **2. Permutation**

⑴ definition: the number of cases in the **order of k balls** among n balls. consideration of order. without-replacement

⑵ permutation with repetition: consideration of order. with-replacement

⑶ permutation of multisets**:** permutation with something that are identical

⑷ circular permutation**:** number of cases sitting around a round table

<br>

<br>

## **3. Combination** (binary coefficient) 

⑴ Overview

> ① definition: number of cases of combination of k balls among n balls. no consideration of order. without-replacement

> ② That is, choosing r items from n distinct items without considering the order and without repetition.

> ③ Examples: cases of selection, choosing representatives (roles that are the same).

⑵ binary coefficient may be expressed in a triangule of Pascal

⑶ combination with repetition

> ① definition**:** consideration of order. with-replacement

>> <sub>n</sub>H<sub>k</sub>

> ② equivalent expression

>> a<sub>1</sub> + ··· + a<sub>n</sub> = k, = k, a<sub>i</sub> ≥ 0

>> ⇔ A<sub>1</sub> + ··· + A<sub>n</sub> = k+n, A<sub>i</sub> ≥1

>> <span> ⇔ □ | □ | ··· | □,     # of □ = (k+n) and # of | = (k+n-1)</span>

>> ⇔ <sub>n</sub>H<sub>k</sub> = <sub>n+k-1</sub>C<sub>n-1</sub> = <sub>n+k-1</sub>C<sub>k</sub>

⑷ **Formula 1.** The number of ways to choose r items from n items is always the same as the number of ways to choose the n-r items that are not selected.

⑸ **Formula 2.**
