## **1. Overview**

⑴ sampling

> ① with-replacement**:** re-injecting and extracting something already extracted

> ② without-replacement**:** extracting without re-injecting what has already been extracted.

⑵ types of number of cases

## **2. Permutation**

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: The number of ways to arrange k balls out of n distinct balls, considering the order. This is a case of selection without replacement.

> ② In other words, selecting r items from n distinct elements without repetition and arranging them in a line.

> ③ Formula: <sub>n</sub>P<sub>r</sub> = n(n−1)(n−2)⋯(n−r+1) (Note: n!=n(n−1)(n−2)⋯2⋅1)

> ④ Examples: Forming a line (e.g., people standing in a row), Selecting representatives for distinct roles

⑵ Types

> ① Permutation with repetition: Order matters; selection with replacement

> ② Permutation of multisets: Permutations that include identical elements

> ③ Circular permutation: Number of ways to arrange elements around a circle (e.g., seating around a round table)

<br>

<br>

## **3. Combination** 

⑴ Overview

> ① definition: number of cases of combination of k balls among n balls. no consideration of order. without-replacement

> ② That is, choosing r items from n distinct items without considering the order and without repetition.

> ③ Examples: cases of selection, choosing representatives (roles that are the same).

⑵ binary coefficient may be expressed in a triangule of Pascal

⑶ combination with repetition

> ① definition**:** consideration of order. with-replacement

>> <sub>n</sub>H<sub>k</sub>

> ② equivalent expression

>> a<sub>1</sub> + ··· + a<sub>n</sub> = k, = k, a<sub>i</sub> ≥ 0

>> ⇔ A<sub>1</sub> + ··· + A<sub>n</sub> = k+n, A<sub>i</sub> ≥1

>> <span> ⇔ □ | □ | ··· | □,     # of □ = (k+n) and # of | = (k+n-1)</span>

>> ⇔ <sub>n</sub>H<sub>k</sub> = <sub>n+k-1</sub>C<sub>n-1</sub> = <sub>n+k-1</sub>C<sub>k</sub>

⑷ **Formula 1.** The number of ways to choose r items from n items is always the same as the number of ways to choose the n-r items that are not selected.

⑸ **Formula 2.**

> ② Combinatorial Interpretation

>> ○ Assume that among n stones, there are k black stones and (n-k) white stones. Now, add one special black stone and assume that this special black stone must be the (m+1)-th black stone.  

>> ○ For each j ∈ {0, ⋯, k}: There are (j+m) stones in front of this black stone, among which m black stones must be placed. Thus, we consider <sub>j+m</sub>C<sub>j</sub>. Also, there are (n-m-j) stones behind this black stone, among which (k-j) black stones must be placed. Thus, we consider <sub>n-m-j</sub>C<sub>k-j</sub>.

>> ○ Since the total number of cases is simply the number of ways to distribute (k+1) black stones and (n-k) white stones, the total count is <sub>n+1</sub>C<sub>k</sub>.
