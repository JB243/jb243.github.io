**2.** Ascending pathways

**3.** **Type 1.** Mechanoreceptors (touch receptors)

**4.** **Type 2.** Nociceptors (pain receptors)

**1. Overview**

⑴ Skin

> ① An outer covering that wraps the body surface

> ② The largest organ in our body

> ③ **Component 1.** Epidermal layer **:** Rich in keratin. Impermeable

> ④ **Component 2.** Dermal layer **:** Rich in collagen fibers, water, electrolytes, proteins, and glycosaminoglycans

⑵ The five cutaneous senses **:** pain, pressure, touch, cold, warmth

**Figure. 1.** Cutaneous receptors for the five skin senses]

> ① Pain **:** The sense of feeling pain

> > ○ Involves nerve endings in the dermis (free endings)

> > ○ Has the greatest number of receptors

> ② Pressure **:** The sense of pressure

> > ○ Involves Merkel's disks in the epidermis

> > ○ Involves Pacinian corpuscles (Pacinian corpuscle) in the dermis

> > > ○ Pacinian corpuscles contain abundant collagen, showing characteristics of phasic receptors

> > > ○ If connective tissue is removed from Pacinian corpuscles, they show characteristics of tonic receptors

> ③ Touch **:** The sense felt when something makes contact

> > ○ Involves Meissner's corpuscles in the epidermis to dermis

> > ○ Many at the lips and fingertips; fewer at the thigh and buttocks

> > ○ More sensitive to hair than to skin

> ④ Cold **:** The sense of coldness

> > ○ Involves the endbulb of Krause in the dermis

> ⑤ Warmth **:** The sense of warmth

> > ○ Involves Ruffini corpuscles in the dermis

> > ○ Has the fewest receptors among the five senses

> ⑥ Comparison of receptor numbers **:** pain＞pressure＞touch＞cold＞warmth

**2. Ascending pathways**

⑴ Most spinal ascending pathways decussate in the medulla

⑵ Sensory information from the skin, joints, and muscles

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Ascends ipsilaterally in the spinal cord, then decussates in the medulla

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Transmitted along the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Projects to the primary sensory cortex via the ventrobasal complex, a specific sensory nucleus of the thalamus

⑶ Pain, temperature, crude or light touch

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Transmitted along the anterolateral system

> > ○ 1<sup>st</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Pain is transmitted via the lateral spinothalamic tract within the anterolateral system

> > ○ 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Temperature is transmitted via the anterior spinothalamic tract within the anterolateral system

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Decussates in the spinal cord

**3. Type 1.** Mechanoreceptors (touch receptors)

**Figure. 3.** Major structures along the sensory pathway]

⑴ VPL (ventral posterolateral nucleus) **:** Delivers sensory information to Brodmann areas 1, 2, and 3

⑵ Somatosensory cortex **:** Parietal lobe; Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3, and 5

> ① Postcentral gyrus **:** Primary somatosensory cortex

> ② Superior parietal lobule **:** Secondary somatosensory cortex

⑶ Somatosensory perception

> ① Proprioceptive sense (self-receptive sense), deep touch **:** Involves the primary somatosensory cortex

> ② Light touch and pain involve the
