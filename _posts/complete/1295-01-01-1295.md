## **1. Overview**

⑴ Pain: An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage
experience (Source: International Association for the Study of Pain (1979))

> ① Nociception (noxious stimulus, nociception): A warning sensation for tissue damage

> ② Pain (pain): A subjective feeling learned through nociception

⑵ Nociceptors

> ① Nociceptor (noxious receptor, nociceptor): A receptor that responds only to noxious stimuli; response increases as the intensity of noxious stimulus increases

> ② Heat and cold are also sensed by nociceptors

⑶ Dimensions of pain

> ① Sensory-discriminative dimension (sensory discriminative)

> > ○ Intraneural microelectrode technique (intraneural microelectrode technic)

## 3. Step 1**.** Sensory discrimination

⑴ Receptive pain: Nociceptors generate warning signals for external stimuli

<br>

<img width="455" height="268" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-20 오후 9 17 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f33c51cb-d3fa-47f5-a675-205e3cc552a2" />

**Figure 3.** Shapes and characteristics of major nociceptors

<br>

> ① Aα and Aβ fibers

> > ○ Large diameter and myelinated: Good nerve-signal conduction → sensitive

> > ○ Proprioception, light touch

> > > ○ Proprioception: Perceiving the body's position

> > > ○ Pain can be inhibited via proprioception; forgetting pain by exercising hard; evolutionarily reasonable

> > ○ Heat threshold: None

> > ○ Aβ fibers: lamina Ⅲ, lamina Ⅳ

> ② Aδ fibers: Sharp nociception accompanied by tissue damage

> > ○ Medium diameter and myelinated: Nerve-signal conduction is moderately good → initial pain

> > ○ Mechanical, thermal, chemical nociception. **Involved in initial pain**

> > ○ Heat threshold: ~53 ℃ (type Ⅰ), ~43 ℃ (type Ⅱ)

> > ○ lamina Ⅰ, deeper layers

> ③ C-polymodal fibers (C-polymodal nociceptor): Related to pain memory; by recruiting emotion to remember pain, enables practical responses to pain later
> pain later

> > ○ Small diameter and unmyelinated: Poor nerve-signal conduction → delayed pain

> > ○ Non-nociceptive sensation for temperature and itch

> > ○ Mechanical, thermal, chemical nociception. **Involved in delayed pain**

> > ○ Heat threshold: ~43 ℃

> > ○ lamina Ⅱ

> ④ Silent fibers (silent nociceptor)

<br>

⑵ Inflammatory pain (inflammatory pain): Surveillance of microenvironmental changes around an injury

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Lesion occurs

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Due to the lesion, bradykinin, 5-HT, prostaglandin, H+, histamine stimulate dorsal root ganglion neurons

> > ○ Bradykinin: A potential vasodilator

> > ○ The English term for 척추신경절 뉴런 is dorsal root ganglion neuron

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Stimulated dorsal root ganglion neurons secrete CGRP and substance P to induce vasodilation

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. At the same time, dorsal root ganglion neurons secrete CGRP and substance P to stimulate mast cells (mast cell)

> > ○ Not only mast cells, but also macrophages, neutrophil granulocytes, etc. are involved

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Mast cells secrete histamine and NGF to stimulate dorsal root ganglion neurons (**positive feedback**)

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. If the stimulus applied to dorsal root ganglion neurons exceeds the threshold, the signal is transmitted to the spinal cord (spinal cord)

⑶ Neuropathic pain (neuropathic pain)

> ① A pathological condition due to damage to neural pathways

> ② Examples: Carpal Tunnel syndrome, spinal cord injury, thalamic stroke

⑷ Dorsal root ganglion (DRG; dorsal root ganglion)

> ① A swelling on the dorsal-root side where the ventral and dorsal roots of the spinal nerve join

> ② The cell bodies of nociceptive nerves are in the DRG

> > ○ Likewise, the cell bodies of other sensory nerves are also in the DRG

> > ○ Cell bodies of nociceptive nerves: Account for **75% of the DRG**, small and dark cells

> > ○ Central processes form synapses in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn

> > ○ Nociceptive nerves: Action potential duration ↑, shows a hump

> ③ Classification of cells by threshold

> > ○ High threshold cell: Aδ, C fibers, 30~40% of STT

> > ○ Wide dynamic range (WDR) cell: Aδ, Aβ fibers; indirectly receives C-fiber input; 50~60% of STT

> > ○ Low threshold cell: Aβ fibers, 5~10% of STT

> ④ Neurotransmitters: Glutamate (glutamate), substance P (substance P), CGRP, etc.

> ⑤ Gate control theory (gate control theory): A theory that pain transmitted to the brain can be regulated or altered via interactions between pain-transmission cells and fibers in the spinal cord
> in the spinal cord

> > ○ There is a system that can weight affective value to recognize importance for touch or pain

> > ○ Theory of Melzack and Wall, Nobel Prize theory

## 4. **Step 2.** Ascending pain pathway

⑴ [Spinothalamic tract](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1203)

> ① **Ascending tract 1.** Pain, temperature sensation, light touch: Decussation occurs at the corresponding spinal ganglion

> ② **Ascending tract 2.** Proprioception, touch: Decussation occurs at the medullary pyramidal tract

> ③ **Descending tract.** Regardless of sensory modality, decussation occurs at the medullary pyramidal tract

<br>

⑵ Spinoreticular tract

⑶ Spinomesencephalic tract

⑷ Spinohypothalamic tract

⑸ Polysynaptic dorsal column pathway

⑹ Effects of multiple pathways

> ① Improved sensory discrimination

> ② Arousal response (arousal response)

> ③ Affective-motivational response (affection-motivational response)

> ④ Autonomic response (autonomic response)

> ⑤ Spinal reflex (spinal reflex)

> ⑥ Improved endogenous analgesic system

<br>

<br>

## 5. **Step 3**. Pain pathway in the brain

⑴ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Thalamus, ACC, amygdala → PAG

⑵ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. PAG → RVM

> ① PAG (periaqueductal gray): Located around the [central aqueduct of the midbrain](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1199), involved in descending modulation of pain

> ② Pain is the most fundamental sensation for human survival, so it remains in the oldest gray-matter structures of the brain

> > ○ Processing the importance of pain (e.g., gate control theory) involves evolutionarily very old PAG and limbic cortex (Limbic Cortex)

⑶ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. RVM → dorsal horn

<br>

<br>

## **6. Step 4.** Endogenous analgesic system

⑴ Definition: An analgesic system in the central nervous system (Basbaum & Fields, 1978)

⑵ **Type 1.** Stimulation-produced analgesia (stimuation-produced analgesia)

> ① Analgesia induced by electrical stimulation of PAG in rats (Reynolds, 1969)

> ② Analgesia induced by stimulating midline brain structures (PAG, PVG, NRM) as well as cerebellum, thalamus, hypothalamus, internal capsule, caudate nucleus, etc.

⑶ **Type 2.** Endogenous opioid system

> ① Receptor proteins for opioids (opioid) exist in the CNS

> > ○ Opioids (opiate-like agents, opioid): A type of chemical substance similar to morphine (morphine)

> > ○ Enkephalin (enkephalin): An endogenous peptide that binds to opioids to produce analgesic effects

> ② Mainly matches SPA sites near the CNS midline

<br>

<br>

## **7. Abnormal pain phenomena**

⑴ Double pain: Essentially a normal phenomenon

> ① Initial pain (initial pain): Aδ nociceptors; sharp and well-demarcated

> ② Delayed pain (delayed pain): C-polymodal nociceptors; poorly demarcated

⑵ Chronic pain (chronic pain)

> ① Definition: Arbitrary, but pain that lasts 3~6 months or longer

> ② Characteristics: Involved in learning and memory processes; mostly a symptom of neuropathy; depends on psychosocial state

⑶ Referred pain (referred pain)

> ① A symptom in which pain due to actual visceral tissue damage is felt at another site such as the skin

> > ○ Example: Instead of sensing that the aorta hurts, it is perceived as a stiff back (a matter of frequency)

> ② Convergence-projection theory (convergence-projection theory): Because visceral organs and dermatomes converge to the same point on the spinal cord, pain is felt in the dermatome connected to the corresponding organ
> organ

⑷ Hyperalgesia (hyperalgesia): Exaggerated perception of minor pain

> ① Primary hyperalgesia: Injury site; mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia; peripheral sensitization

> ② Secondary hyperalgesia: Surrounding area; mechanical hyperalgesia; central sensitization

> ③ Mechanism: Axons of Aβ receptors form synapses with two or more neurons, amplifying the signal to more than double

> ④ Example: Erythromelalgia (erythromelalgia)

⑸ Allodynia (allodynia): Feeling pain even from stimuli that would not normally cause pain

⑹ Phantom limb (phantom limb pain, phantom limb): Feeling pain in a body part that has been amputated and is no longer present

⑺ Congenital analgesia (congenital analgesia)
