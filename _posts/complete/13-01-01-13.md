**Figure 3.** Terminal characteristics and sign of capacitor

> ② Proof: Proof for Q = CΔV for two conductors

>> ○ **Assumption 1:** Two conductors A and B with voltages VA (t) and VB (t) are connected by a wire.

>> ○ **Assumption 2:** Initial charges on A and B and VA (t) - VB (t) are both 0.

>> ○ (Note) Since any two conductors always start in Assumption 2, this assumption is reasonable.

>> ○ Current flows from B to A through the wire, causing displacement current from A to B: Displacement current is described by Maxwell's equations.

>> ○ Applying integration by parts gives

>> ○ C: = g(t) ⇒ Q = CΔV

>> ○ (Note) In reality, ∫ f '(t) (VA \- VB) ∝ VA \- VB does not hold, so Q = CΔV doesn't hold for real capacitors.

>> ○ (Note) Knowing Q ＞ 0 and ΔV ＞ 0 implies C ＞ 0.

> ③ Proof: Proof for Q = CΔV for n conductors

>> ○ **Assumption 1:** n+1 conductors with voltages vp for each conductor with respect to a reference conductor.

>> ○ **Assumption 2:** All voltages except vp and vq are 0.

>> ○ Can use conclusion of **Case 1**.

>> ○ General equation

>> ○ **Case 1:** When the distance of the capacitor keeps changing: Used for creating speed sensors based on C variation.

>> ○ **Case 2:** Capacitors treated in circuit theory have fixed electrodes, so the second term is always 0.
