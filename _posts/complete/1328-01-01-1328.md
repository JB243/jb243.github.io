**Figure 4.** Rutherford's Atomic Model 

<br>

>> ○ Alpha particles not passing through the 1/20,000 cm gold foil ≒ Bullets not passing through thin tissue paper

>> ○ Presence of a heavy, dense structure with significant positive charge: Introduction of atomic nucleus

>> ○ In other words, alpha particles scatter because their mass is smaller than the gold foil's atomic nucleus

>> ○ Solar system model proposed (1910): Atoms with a central nucleus around which electrons orbit

> ⑥ **Limitations** **1.** Stability of Atoms

>> ○ Cannot explain stability of electrons in circular orbits

>> ○ Accelerating electrons emit light energy and eventually fall into the nucleus

> ⑦ **Limitations 2.** Hydrogen Gas Line Spectrum: According to the solar system model, a continuous spectrum should be observed

**Figure 5.** Periodic Table 

<br>

>> ○ Period: Number of electron shells. 1st period, 2nd period, ···

>> ○ Group: Set of atoms with the same number of outermost electrons

>> ○ Metal: Group of atoms with a strong tendency to donate electrons

>> ○ Nonmetal: Group of atoms with a strong tendency to gain electrons

>> ○ Actinides: f-block

> ② Periodic Behavior of Atoms: Involves forces between nucleus and electrons (number of protons in the nucleus, nuclear-electron distance), electron-electron repulsion

> ③ Atomic Radius

>> ○ Atomic size cannot be precisely defined due to the probabilistic nature of electron clouds

>> ○ **Definition 1:** Half the distance between the nuclei of two atoms bonded together (excluding noble gases)

>>> ○ Rational to define the atomic radii of O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> as half the distance between their nuclei

>>> ○ Unreasonable to define the atomic radius of HF using this approach

>>> ○ Definition 1 concept can also be applied to metallic bonding

>> ○ **Definition 2:** Defined using Van der Waals radius (applies to noble gases)

>> ○ Ion Radius Definition: Consideration of distance and weighting between ions in ionic bonding

>> ○ **Trend 1:** Atomic radius decreases with increasing atomic number in the same period

>> ○ **Trend 2:** Atomic radius increases with increasing number of electron shells in the same group

> ④ Effective Nuclear Charge: The positive charge felt by an electron, a measure of the attractive force considering electron repulsion

>> ○ Comparison of effective nuclear charge within an atom: Inner orbitals experience greater effective nuclear charge

>> ○ Comparison of effective nuclear charge of outermost electrons between atoms

>>> ○ Within the same period, atomic radius decreases as atomic number increases, leading to an increase in effective nuclear charge

>>> ○ Within the same group, effective nuclear charge slightly increases as the number of electron shells increases (opposite trend to ionization energy)

>>> ○ With an increase in the number of electron shells, shielding effect weakens, strengthening nuclear repulsion, as understood

>> ○ Comparison of effective nuclear charge of specific orbitals between atoms

>>> ○ With an increase in atomic number, the effective nuclear charge of a specific orbital mentioned in the problem increases

>> ○ Slater's Rule: A formula for effective nuclear charge

<br>

<br>

>>> ○ If the number of valence electrons in the outermost shell is denoted as n, then the S constant values for n, n-1, n-2, n-3, ··· are 0.35, 0.85, 1, 1, ···

>>> ○ When calculating the effective nuclear charge for n-level electrons, subtract one because oneself does not influence the calculation

>>> ○ For example, applying S = 0.3 to the effective nuclear charge calculation for 1s orbit electrons

> ⑤ First Ionization Energy (IE)

>> ○ **Definition**

>>> ○ X(_g_) → X<sup>+</sup>(_g_) + e<sup>-</sup>(_g_), IE = E(X<sup>+</sup>) - E(X). IE > 0.

>>> ○ Orbital interpretation: Energy needed to move an electron from E<sub>1</sub> to infinity

**Figure 6.** Trends in Ionization Energy

<br>

>> ○ **Comparison of 2nd and 13th groups**

>>> ○ Orbital energy level is ns < np, so ionization energy is lower in the 13th group

>>> ○ For the same reason, the 2<sup>nd</sup> ionization energy is lower in the 14th group compared to the 13th group

>> ○ **Comparison of 15th and 16th groups**

>>> ○ Ionization energy is lower in the 16th group due to repulsion between paired electrons

>>> ○ Nitrogen is stable as [He] 2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup>, while oxygen as [He] 2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup> is less stable

>> ○ Element with the highest ionization energy: Helium

>> ○ Sequential Ionization Energies: Requires very high energy to remove inner electrons, allowing determination of the atomic number

>>> ○ 1st Ionization Energy (1<sup>st</sup> I.E.): E(X<sup>+</sup>) - E(X)

>>> ○ 2nd Ionization Energy (2<sup>nd</sup> I.E.): E(X<sup>2+</sup>) - E(X<sup>+</sup>)

>>> ○ 3rd Ionization Energy (3<sup>rd</sup> I.E.): E(X<sup>3+</sup>) - E(X<sup>2+</sup>)

>>> ○ **Tip:** Sequential ionization energy trends according to atomic number parallel the trend of 1st ionization energy

>> ○ Measurement: Franck-Hertz apparatus

<br>

**Figure 7.** Measurement of ionization energy through the Franck-Hertz apparatus

<br>

>>> ○ Situation: Low-energy electrons are accelerated between the electrodes inside a tube filled with gas.

>>> ○ Result: Accelerated electrons can transfer energy to gas particles through collisions.

>>> ○ Interpretation: Accelerated electrons can lose a specific amount of kinetic energy (4.9 eV) through collisions with gas particles, and this value can be considered the first ionization energy of gas particles.

> ⑥ Electron Affinity (EA): The energy released when one mole of gaseous atoms gains one mole of electrons.

>> ○ **Definition**

>>> ○ X<sup>-</sup>(_g_) → X(_g_) + e<sup>-</sup>(_g_), EA = E(X) - E(X<sup>-</sup>). EA can be greater than 0 or less than 0.

>>> ○ Ionization energy of X = Electron affinity of X<sup>+</sup>

>>> ○ All ionization energies are greater than electron affinities (**∵** E(X<sup>+</sup>) ≫ E(X), E(X<sup>-</sup>))

>> ○ **Trend 1.** Generally increases going up and to the right on the periodic table.

>> ○ **Trend 2.** Electron affinities of elements B to F in the 2nd period are exceptionally lower than those of elements in the same group in the 3rd period.

>> ○ Electron affinities of elements with maximum single electron configurations in groups 2, 15, and 18 are very small.

>> ○ Element with the highest electron affinity: Cl

>> ○ O, S become O<sup>2-</sup> and S<sup>2-</sup> ions, which is unexpected as absorbing the second electron requires energy.

> ⑦ Electronegativity (EN): A combination of ionization energy and electron affinity concepts.

>> ○ Mathematical expression: E.N = (IE + EA) / 2

>> ○ Electronegativity increases with increasing atomic number in the same period.

>> ○ Electronegativity decreases with increasing electron shells in the same group.

>> ○ **Tip:** Electronegativity increases as you get closer to F.

>> ○ Essential memorization: H(2.1), B(2.0), C(2.5), N(3.0), O(3.5), F(4.0), Cl(3.0), Br(2.8)

## **3\. Classical Molecular Models**

⑴ Overview: **Lewis Structure** - Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory - Atomic Bonding Theory - Molecular Orbital Theory

> ① Simplest molecular model

> ② 2D model

> ③ Localized electron model

⑵ Molecular Theory

> ① Molecule: The smallest unit of a substance that can exist independently in a stable state.

>> ○ Rare for atoms to exist independently in nature.

>> ○ Exception: Inert gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn)

> ② Ion: An atom or group of atoms with a net positive or negative charge.

> ③ Introduction of Avogadro's Number: Can directly count the number of carbons in a carbon crystal.

> ④ Law of Constant Composition: Elements combine in fixed integer ratios.

>> ○ Discovered by Joseph Louis Proust.

> ⑤ Law of Multiple Proportions: Different elements combine in whole-number ratios.

>> ○ Except when two elements form more than two compounds.

>> ○ Established by Dalton.

⑶ Octet Rule

> ① Overview

>> ○ Definition: Atoms tend to gain or lose electrons to achieve an electron configuration of eight electrons.

>> ○ Most organic atoms, excluding H, C, N, O, X, Na, K, satisfy the octet rule.

> ② Reasons for the Octet Rule

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> period atoms have only s and p orbitals, providing eight electron positions.

>> ○ Eight electrons satisfy normal wave conditions, leading to more stable molecules.

> ③ **Exception 1.** Radicals: Chemical species with unpaired electrons. Molecules with two radicals are called biradicals.

> ④ **Exception 2.** Expanded Valence Shells

>> ○ Transition elements

>> ○ Temporary excitation in 3<sup>rd</sup> period atoms → electrons placed in vacant 3d orbitals → varied valence shell electrons → expanded octet rule

> ⑤ **Exception 3.** Incomplete Octet

>> ○ BF<sub>3</sub>:BF<sub>3</sub> exhibits ionic bonding where B has a 3+ charge and F has a -1 charge.

⑷ **Intramolecular Forces** (Chemical Bonds)

> ① Bond: Interaction between two atoms leading to stability.

<br>

**Figure 9.** Principles of Chemical Bonding

<br>

>> ○ **Principle 1.** Energy decreases as two atoms approach each other (stability).

>> ○ **Principle 2.** Energy increases significantly when atoms get closer than the bonding point (instability).

>> ○ Inert gases exist as single-atom molecules due to satisfying the octet rule.

>> ○ Inert gases usually do not participate in bonding (exceptions exist).

> ② Ionic Bonding: Occurs when the electronegativity difference between two atoms is greater than 1.9.

>> ○ Metal atoms lose electrons to become cations, nonmetal atoms gain electrons to become anions, held together by electrostatic forces.

>> ○ Examples: NaCl, LiCl, KF

> ③ Covalent Bonding: Bonding where two nonmetal atoms share electron pairs to form a bond.

> ④ Metallic Bonding: Metal atoms form bonds by sharing a "sea" of delocalized electrons, stabilizing the structure.

> ⑤ Bond Energy (Bond Dissociation Energy, BDE)

>> ○ Definition: Energy required to break a bond between A and B, stronger bonds have higher BDE (more stable).

>>> ○ For ionic bonds: Energy required to separate ions in an ionic crystal lattice.

>>> ○ For covalent bonds: Energy required to break covalent bonds and produce radicals.

>> ○ Trends

>>> ○ As the electronegativity difference between bonding atoms increases, bond energy increases.

>>> ○ **Example 1:** HF > HCl > HBr > HI: Can be explained by electronegativity difference or size difference.

>>> ○ **Example 2.** (Under general conditions) I<sub>2</sub> (151 kJ/mol) < F<sub>2</sub> (155 kJ/mol) < Br<sub>2</sub> (193 kJ/mol) < Cl<sub>2</sub> (244 kJ/mol): F<sub>2</sub> has a surprisingly low bond dissociation energy because the fluorine atom is small, leading to strong electron-electron repulsion. I<sub>2</sub> has the lowest value because its large atomic size results in poor overlap of bonding orbitals, making the bond weaker.

>>> ○ **Example 3.** (Under conditions where lone pair repulsion is significant) F<sub>2</sub> < Cl<sub>2</sub> < Br<sub>2</sub> < I<sub>2</sub>: F<sub>2</sub> shows the highest lone pair repulsion, which also contributes to its high reactivity.

>> ○ Bond Comparison

>>> ○ Generally: Ionic bond > Covalent bond > Metallic bond ( _controversial_ )

>>> ○ In aqueous environments like living organisms: Covalent bond > Ionic bond > Metallic bond, influenced by solvent effects.

>> ○ Boiling and melting points comparison

>>> ○ Ionic bond, metallic bond > Covalent bond

⑸ Covalent Bonding

> ① Unbonded atom electrons exist as nonbonding electron pairs.

> ② Covalent bonds categorized based on electronegativity difference

>> ○ Polar covalent bond: Electronegativity difference between two atoms is 0.5 to less than 1.9 (0.5 is not a strict number).

>>> ○ δ<sup>+</sup> and δ<sup>-</sup> indicate stronger attraction and weaker attraction, respectively.

>>> ○ Polar covalent bonds create dipole moments due to opposing charges.

>> ○ Nonpolar covalent bond: Electronegativity difference between two atoms is less than 0.5.

>> ○ Ionic bonding can also be seen as polar covalent bonding with an electronegativity difference of 1.9 (1.7 to 2.0).

>>> ○ Implies that covalent bonding principles can apply to metallic bonding.

> ③ Covalent bond types based on the number of shared electrons: Single bond, double bond, triple bond.

> ④ Coordinate Bonding: An atom provides electron pairs to another atom's vacant orbital for shared bonding.

>> ○ Examples: H<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>

>> ○ Examples: H<sup>+</sup> + NH<sub>3</sub> → NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>

⑹ **Intermolecular Forces**

> ① Intermolecular forces are divided into van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds, which are weaker than chemical bonds.

> ② Van der Waals forces are categorized as Keesom force, Debye force, London force, and repulsion force.

> ③ Keesom Force: Permanent dipole-permanent dipole interaction between polar molecules.

>> ○ Attraction between δ<sup>+</sup> and δ<sup>-</sup> in polar molecules.

> ④ Debye Force: Permanent dipole-induced dipole interaction between polar and nonpolar molecules.

>> ○ Polar molecules induce polarization in nearby nonpolar molecules.

> ⑤ London forces or dispersion forces: These are forces of attraction between instantaneous dipoles caused by the temporary polarization (fluctuation) of electrons.

>> ○ They are very weak forces that arise due to temporary dipoles (induced dipoles) created by the polarization of electrons.

>> ○ These forces are the only type of attraction found in nonpolar compounds.

>> ○ They operate in all molecules and are stronger when the atomic radius and surface area are larger (for example, the van der Waals forces in I<sub>2</sub> are much stronger than those in F<sub>2</sub>).

>> ○ They can explain the liquefaction of noble gases.

> ⑥ Repulsion Force: Nucleus-nucleus repulsion when molecules get too close.

>> ○ **Trend 1.** Repulsion increases as atomic number increases in the same period.

>> ○ Result of increased electron shielding due to higher electron count.

>> ○ **Trend 2.** Repulsion increases as atomic number increases in the same group.

>> ○ Result of decreased electron shielding due to lower electron count.

> ⑦ Hydrogen Bonding: Strong attraction between δ+ in H bonded to F, O, N, and δ- in F, O, N.

>> ○ Hydrogen bonding is one of the van der Waals forces, but it should not be equated with other dipole-dipole interactions.

>> ○ **Principle 1.** Hydrogen exposes its proton due to lack of core electrons, resembling ionic bonding.

>> ○ **Principle 2.** Strength of hydrogen bonds

**Figure 10.** Boiling points based on electronegativity of atoms bonded to hydrogen

<br>

>>> ○ Boiling points are significantly affected by hydrogen bond strength.

>>> ○ Factors of hydrogen bond strength: Electronegativity of atoms bonded to hydrogen, number of hydrogen bonds.

>>> ○ Number of hydrogen bonds: The number of non-shared electron pairs of atoms with high electronegativity and the number of hydrogens within a molecule are important[Note:6]

>>> ○ H<sub>2</sub>O: O has two non-shared electron pairs. There are 2 hydrogens in the molecule, so there are **4** hydrogen bonds per molecule.

>>> ○ HF: F has three non-shared electron pairs. There's 1 hydrogen in the molecule (limiting factor), so there are **2** hydrogen bonds per molecule.

>>> ○ NH<sub>3</sub>: N has one non-shared electron pair (limiting factor). There are 3 hydrogens in the molecule, so there are **2** hydrogen bonds per molecule.

>>> ○ Urea: Forms 6 hydrogen bonds per molecule.

>> ○ Specific strength of hydrogen bonding:

>>> ○ F-H ······ :F = 39 kcal/mol

>>> ○ O-H ······ :N = 7 kcal/mol

>>> ○ O-H ······ :O = 5 kcal/mol

>>> ○ N-H ······ :N = 3 kcal/mol

>>> ○ N-H ······ :O = 2 kcal/mol

>> ○ Can form multimers in liquids and solids

> ⑧ Relative strength: Covalent bond, Ionic bond > Metallic bond > Hydrogen bond > Dipole-dipole force ≒ Dispersion force

>> ○ Ion-ion bond strength: 250 kJ/mol

>> ○ Ion-dipole bond strength: 15 kJ/mol

>> ○ Permanent dipole-permanent dipole bond strength (stationary condition): 2 kJ/mol

>> ○ Permanent dipole-permanent dipole bond strength (rotating condition): 0.3 kJ/mol

<br>

>> ○ Example: In the case of BaCl<sub>2</sub>, since Z is large, it is very stable and doesn't hydrate easily.

> ⑩ If the bond within a molecule is strong, the bond between molecules is weak.

> ① Lewis structure and Kekulé structure:

>> ○ Lewis structure: Dot structure

>> ○ Kekulé structure: Line structure that simply represents a pair of covalent bond electrons

>> ○ Usually, both structures are combined and referred to as the Lewis structure.

> ② Drawing:

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Draw the basic skeleton of the compound from the molecular formula

>>> ○ Generally, the central atom has a low electronegativity, and the surrounding atoms have high electronegativity.

>>> ○ Elements in the 2nd period should satisfy the octet rule (exceptions: Be, B)

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Count the valence electrons of all atoms

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Connect single bonds between atoms (each bond consumes 2 electrons)

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Indicate non-shared electron pairs on all atoms

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Indicate charges considering the [formal charge](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1328#:~:text=5.-,%ED%98%95%EC%8B%9D%EC%A0%84%ED%95%98,-%5B%EB%AA%A9%EC%B0%A8%5D)

> ③ Limitations:

>> ○ Cannot understand the bond shape of orbitals: Emergence of 3D structures and VSEPR theory

>> ○ Cannot distinguish between sigma and pi bonds: Orbital theory emerges

>> ○ Limitations in explaining bond lengths

>> ○ Actual structures that cannot be explained with one structure: Represented by resonance structures

⑵ Bond-line formula or skeletal formula:

> ① Introduced because representing all organic compounds with Lewis structures was cumbersome

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Carbon atoms are generally not shown, but sometimes indicated for emphasis

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Hydrogens bonded to carbon are not shown; since carbon always has a valency of 4, the number of hydrogens can be inferred

⑶ 3D structures:

> ① Definition: A method to represent structures in three dimensions

> ② Bonds protruding from the surface are indicated with wedges, and bonds going into the surface are indicated with dashed lines

> ③ Bonds on the surface are usually indicated with straight lines

## **5. Formal charge**

⑴ Definition: A fictitious charge that arises when a shared electron pair is evenly divided

⑵ Calculation: Valence electrons - Bonded electrons ÷ 2 - Non-shared electrons

⑶ Rules

> ① In nature, molecules should have a sum of formal charges equal to 0

> ② If multiple Lewis structures can be drawn, the structure with the smaller formal charge is more stable

> ③ If a formal charge arises, structures in which elements with high electronegativity have a (-) formal charge are more stable
