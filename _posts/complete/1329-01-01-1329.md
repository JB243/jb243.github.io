**Figure 2.** Uncertainty Principle and Microscopy 

<br>

>> ○ Momentum of a photon with wavelength λ is h/λ, so decreasing λ increases photon's momentum

>> ○ Larger momentum leads to larger Δp of the electron

>> ○ Conclusion: Decreasing λ to improve microscope resolution increases Δp, making it harder to know momentum

> ② The probability of the electron moving between the probe and the sample is lower when the probe is at P compared to when it's at Q ( **∵** due to the wider barrier)

> ③ The current is weaker when the probe is at P compared to when it's at Q (**∵** due to the lower probability of electron movement)
