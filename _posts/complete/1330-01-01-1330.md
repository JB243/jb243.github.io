## 1. **VSEPR** (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Model)

⑴ Overview: Lewis Structures - **Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory (VSEPR)** - Valence Bond Theory - Molecular Orbital Theory

> ① Model for predicting the three-dimensional structure of molecules using the principle of electron-electron repulsion.

> ② Three-dimensional model

⑵ Rules

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Arrange shared and unshared electron pairs as far apart as possible to minimize electron-pair repulsion.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Treat double and triple bonds as a single unit.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Consider unshared electron pairs equivalent to atoms; a single unpaired electron is equivalent to a single unshared electron pair.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Unshared electron pairs exert greater repulsion than shared electron pairs, resulting in smaller bond angles on the opposite side of the unshared pair.

>> ○ CH<sub>4</sub>: C-H bond angle is 109.5°

>> ○ NH<sub>3</sub>: N-H bond angle is 107°

>> ○ H<sub>2</sub>O: O-H bond angle is 105°

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. By considering atomic size, electronegativity, and more, detailed molecular structures can be predicted.

>> ○ **VSEPR Rule:** Increasing bond polarity → Decreasing atomic distance → Increasing repulsion → Increasing bond angle

>> ○ Example: N is smaller than P, leading to larger electron repulsion and greater bond angles in NH<sub>3</sub> compared to PH<sub>3</sub>

⑶ Steric Number

> ① Definition: Number of atoms bonded to the central atom + Number of unshared electron pairs on the central atom

> ② Steric Number 2: sp

>> ○ Linear (Example: BeF<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>): Bond angle of 180°

<br>

> ③ Steric Number 3: sp<sup>2</sup>

>> ○ Trigonal planar (Example: BF<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>): Bond angle of 120°

<br>

**Figure 2.** Structure of BF<sub>3</sub>

<br>

>> ○ Bent shape: When there is one pair of unshared electrons

> ④ Steric Number 4: sp<sup>3</sup>

>> ○ Tetrahedral (Example: CH<sub>4</sub>): Tetrahedral angle, so bond angle is 109.5°

>> ○ Trigonal pyramidal: When there is one pair of unshared electrons (Example: NH<sub>3</sub>)

>> ○ Bent shape: When there are two pairs of unshared electrons (Example: H<sub>2</sub>O)

> ⑤ Steric Number 5: sp<sup>3</sup>d. Unshared electron pairs cause significant repulsion, so they are placed in the horizontal plane to minimize repulsion.

>> ○ Trigonal bipyramidal

>> ○ See-saw shape: When there is one pair of unshared electrons, they lie in the horizontal plane

>> ○ T-shaped: When there are two pairs of unshared electrons, they lie in the horizontal plane

>> ○ Linear shape: When there are three pairs of unshared electrons, they lie in the horizontal plane (Example: ICl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, XeF<sub>2</sub>)

<br>

> ⑥ Steric Number 6: sp<sup>3</sup>d<sup>2</sup>. Unshared electron pairs cause significant repulsion, so they are placed in the vertical direction to minimize repulsion.

>> ○ Octahedral

>> ○ Square pyramid: When there is one pair of unshared electrons, they lie in the vertical direction (Example: SF<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup>, IF<sub>5</sub>)

>> ○ Planar square: When there are two pairs of unshared electrons, they lie in the vertical direction (Example: XeF<sub>4</sub>, SF<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>)

⑷ Cautionary Notes

> ① In cases where the steric number is 5, the vertically oriented bonding electron pairs experience greater repulsion than the horizontally oriented bonding electron pairs, resulting in longer bond lengths.

> ② In cases where the steric number is 6, the concepts of vertical and horizontal orientation do not apply, so the discussion in ① does not hold.

> ③ Occurrence of violations of the octet rule

>> ○ Reason for satisfying the octet rule: Violating the octet rule in the second and third period electron shells leads to increased electron repulsion.

>> ○ Larger atoms allocate more space to outer electrons, allowing them to be stable without forming octets.

>> ○ Second-period atoms lack d orbitals, preventing extension of the octet rule.

>> ○ Third-period atoms have d orbitals, allowing extension of the octet rule: PCl<sub>5</sub> (trigonal bipyramidal), SF<sub>4</sub> (seesaw), ClF<sub>3</sub> (T-shaped), I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (linear)

## **2\. Dipole Moment**

⑴ Overview

> ① [Dipole](https://jb243.github.io/pages/749#2-dipole): A state where equal and opposite charges are placed at two points separated by a certain distance.

> ② Dipole moment (Double Dipole Moment)

>> ○ Represents the polarity of a chemical bond with a bond moment.

>> ○ Indicates the extent of electron pair distortion.

>> ○ For example, two atoms with different electronegativities forming a bond will have a dipole moment.

> ③ Formula: Dipole Moment (Unit: D) = μ = q × d

>> ○ q: Charge of the atom

>> ○ d: Distance between charges, i.e., distance between δ+ and δ-

>> ○ Dipole moment is also influenced by the difference in electronegativity and the distance between nuclei.

> ④ Dipole moments are represented by arrows **⤉**

>> ○ In physics, the direction of the dipole moment is from the (-) pole to the (+) pole.

>> ○ In chemistry, the direction of the dipole moment is from the (+) pole to the (-) pole, reflecting the arrangement of atoms with nuclei at the center.

> ⑤ Unit: D (debye)

>> ○ 1 debye = 10<sup>-18</sup> esu·cm

>> ○ 1 e<sup>-</sup> = 4.80 × 10<sup>-10</sup> esu

| Major Bond | Dipole Moment | Major Bond | Dipole Moment |
|------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| H–C        | 0.4            | C–C        | 0              |
| H–N        | 1.3            | C–N        | 0.2            |
| H–O        | 1.5            | C–O        | 0.7            |
| H–F        | 1.7            | C–F        | 1.51           |
| H–Cl       | 1.1            | C–Cl       | 1.56           |
| H–Br       | 0.8            | C–Br       | 1.48           |
| H–I        | 0.4            | C–I        | 1.29           |

⑶ Molecular Dipole Moment

> ① Definition: The sum of all bond dipole moments in a molecule.

> ② Considerations when calculating

>> ○ All polar bonds and the direction of their polarity

>> ○ Count the number of axes centered around individual atoms to determine the molecular geometry.

>> ○ Evaluate whether dipole moments reinforce or cancel each other out in individual spatial regions.

> ③ Trends

>> ○ Nonpolar molecules: μ = 0

>>> ○ Charge is distributed evenly throughout the molecule and reacts to external electric fields.

>>> ○ Examples: CH<sub>4</sub> (methane), C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (ethane), C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (benzene), CO<sub>2</sub>, BF<sub>3</sub>, CCl<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub> (alkane), 1,4-dichlorobenzene

>> ○ Polar molecules: μ ≠ 0

>>> ○ Charge is skewed towards one side, resulting in δ<sup>+</sup> and δ<sup>-</sup> regions within the molecule.

>>> ○ Alignment of the molecule occurs in response to external electric fields.

>>> ○ Polar molecules readily dissolve in other polar molecules.

>>> ○ **Example 1:** H<sub>2</sub>O (water): μ = 1.85 D

>>> ○ **Example 2:** CH<sub>3</sub>OH (methanol): μ = 1.70 D

>>> ○ **Example 3:** NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia): μ = 1.47 D

>>> ○ **Example 4:** imidazole: μ = 5.6 D

>>> ○ **Example 5:** oxazole: μ = 1.4 D

>>> ○ **Example 6:** thiazole: μ = 1.6 D

>>> ○ **Example 7:** C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> is nonpolar in the _trans_ configuration and polar in the _cis_ configuration.

>> ○ Effective resonance reduces dipole moment since formal charges are distributed.

>>> ○ Examples: chlorobenzene < chlorohexane

>> ○ Dipole moment increases due to electron delocalization caused by aromaticity and other factors.

>> ○ Generally, higher dipole moments correspond to higher boiling points.

>>> ○ Exception: carbon tetrachloride (μ = 0, bp = 77°C) > chloroform (μ = 1.0 D, bp = 62°C)

>>> ○ Reason: Carbon tetrachloride's van der Waals forces are stronger.

> ④ **Caution 1:** Consideration of Hyperconjugation

>> ○ Carbon-carbon bonds have zero electronegativity difference, but hyperconjugation allows sp3 carbon to donate electrons to sp<sup>2</sup> carbon.

>> ○ sp<sup>3</sup> carbon cannot donate electrons to other sp<sup>3</sup> carbon.

>> ○ μ for R-X: R-Cl > R-F > R-Br > R-I

>> ○ μ for HX: HF > HCl > HBr > HI

>> ○ Boiling point: HF (19.5°C) > HI (-35.36°C) > HBr (-66°C) > HCl (-85.05°C)

>>> ○ Reason for HI > HBr > HCl: Polarizability

>>> ○ Reason for higher boiling point of HF: Hydrogen bonding

>> ○ The difference in trends between R–X and H–X is associated with orbital interactions in C–X bonds (e.g., n→σ* donation), which, in a broader sense, resemble hyperconjugation.
