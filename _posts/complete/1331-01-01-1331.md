## **1\. Overview**

⑴ In cells with ecDNA, nuclear staining may reveal small dot-like structures, often called "**double minutes** " (DMs), distinct from the linear chromosomes.

⑵ ecDNA is circular → **Continuous replication, Discordant edge**

> ② Concordant edges connect consecutive sequences with respect to the reference genome order, and discordant edges connect nonconsecutive genome segments.

⑶ Different scenarios of ecDNA composition per sample.

> ① **Singleton:** presence of a single ecDNA structure

> ② **Co-occurrence:** presence of different ecDNA species, without overlapping

> ③ **Heterogeneity:** presence of different ecDNA species, with overlapping

⑷ ecDNA reconstruction is challenging, as different co-occurring ecDNA elements have **overlapping** genomic foodprints, making it difficult to attribute the overlapping features to each of the different circular elements.

⑸ Existing methods

> ① **Simple circular amplicons:** Circle-Map, ecc_finder

> ② **Complex ecDNA:** AmpliconArchitect, AmpliconReconstructor, CReSIL

> ③ **De novo assembler:** Shasta

⑹ Heuristic strategies return **multiple** small cycles that can later be recombined.

⑺ ecDNA structures are complex rearrangements, and currently, no guidelines or gold-standard data sets exist to assess the quality and performance of the reconstructions.
