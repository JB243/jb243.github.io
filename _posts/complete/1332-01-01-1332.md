>> ○ Example: 1s → 2p is allowed, but 1s → 2s is not allowed.

> ③ Change in magnetic quantum number: Δmℓ = 0, ±1

> ④ Change in spin quantum number: an electron’s spin does not change during a transition (law of spin conservation).

> ⑤ In general, Δj = 0, ±1; the transition j = 0 → j = 0 is forbidden, and in special cases Δj = ±2 can also occur.

 ⑷ Application **:** Flame Test

> ① Overview

>> ○ Established through alchemical studies in the Middle Ages.

>> ○ Indirectly implies quantized energy levels of electrons.

> ② Flame test used as an elemental detection method.

>> ○ Chemical species emitting visible light are restricted under electron transition limitations.

>> ○ Not prominently distinctive due to the energy difference between ns and np orbitals.

> ③ Examples
