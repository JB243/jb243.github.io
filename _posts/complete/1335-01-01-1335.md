## **1\. Band Gap Theory**

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: A theory that analyzes the potential energy of bound atoms, not free particles.

> ② A theory used to explain [semiconductors](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1092#1-semiconductor)

>> ○ Faraday was the first to observe semiconductors.

>> ○ A semiconductor has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator, and its conductivity can be controlled depending on temperature, purity, etc.

⑵ Fermi–Dirac Statistics

> ① Fermi–Dirac distribution

>> ○ Definition: The probability that an energy level E is occupied by a particle at an arbitrary temperature T.

>> ○ Valence electrons in a crystal lattice follow the Fermi–Dirac distribution.

> ② Fermi level

>> ○ Definition: The highest energy level that electrons in a solid can have at 0 K.

>> ○ The Fermi level defined this way corresponds to an energy where, at an arbitrary temperature, the probability of electron occupation is one-half (50%).

>> ○ A certain fraction of electrons with energies higher than the Fermi level ignore the atomic nucleus’s potential and become free electrons.

>> ○ Conductor: The Fermi level lies at the boundary between the conduction band and the valence band.

>> ○ Insulator: The Fermi level exists in the middle between the conduction band and the valence band.

>> ○ Semiconductor: The Fermi level exists in the middle between the conduction band and the valence band.

> ③ Fermi gas

>> ○ Fermi gas (free-electron gas): An ensemble of non-interacting fermions.

>> ○ Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, at absolute zero temperature the average energy of a Fermi gas is greater than that of a single particle in the ground state.

>> ○ Degeneracy pressure: Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, the pressure of a Fermi gas at absolute zero is nonzero.

⑶ [Connection to Circuit Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1092#1-semiconductor)

> ① The size of the energy gap determines electrical conductivity and resistivity

>> ○ Conductor: The valence band and the conduction band overlap.

>>> ○ At room temperature, many electrons can move freely between atoms.

>>> ○ <b>Example 1:</b> Silver has resistivity ρ = 1.59 × 10<sup>-6</sup> Ω·cm

>>> ○ <b>Example 2:</b> Copper has resistivity ρ = 1.67 × 10<sup>-6</sup> Ω·cm

>> ○ Semiconductor: The band gap is small.

>>> ○ <b>Example 1:</b> Germanium has resistivity ρ = 50 Ω·cm
  
>>> ○ <b>Example 2:</b> Silicon has resistivity ρ = 250,000 Ω·cm; the energy gap is 1.12 eV.

>> ○ Insulator: The band gap is large.

>>> ○ <b>Example 1:</b> Diamond has resistivity ρ = 10<sup>12</sup> Ω·cm

>>> ○ <b>Example 2:</b> Mica has resistivity ρ = 9 × 10<sup>12</sup> Ω·cm

> ② Resistance change with temperature

>> ○ Conductor: Temperature increase → increased atomic vibration → resistance increases.

>> ○ Semiconductor: Temperature increase → increased free electrons and holes → resistance decreases.

>> ○ Insulator: Temperature increase → electrons detach from atoms → resistance decreases.

>> ○ In semiconductors and insulators, the resistance-decreasing effect is larger than the resistance-increasing effect caused by increased atomic vibration.

>> ○ Semiconductor-based devices (e.g., computer components) can experience temperature increases that induce overcurrent, which is why cooling systems are necessary.

## **4\. Energy Bands and Brillouin Zone**

 ⑴ **Interpretation 1:** Mathematical Interpretation

> ① Potential energy f(ξ) oscillates

> ② cos k(a+b) takes values between -1 and 1

> ③ As ξ increases, non-existence of solutions → existence of solutions → non-existence of solutions → ···

> ④ Conclusion: Energy levels appear as bands.

 ⑵ **Interpretation 2:** Pauli Exclusion Principle

> ① Pauli Exclusion Principle: No more than one electron with the same quantum numbers can exist in a single orbital

> ② Many atoms together cause energy levels to overlap and shift slightly, forming energy bands

<br>

**Figure 3.** Formation of Energy Bands Due to Orbital Overlap 

<br>

 ⑶ **Interpretation 3:** Coulomb's Law

> ① Electrons repel each other, causing slight splitting of energy levels

> ② Many atoms together cause energy levels to shift slightly, forming energy bands

 ⑷ Classification of Energy Bands

> ① **Energy Band:** Continuous range where solutions exist.

> ② **Forbidden Band Gap:** Continuous range without solutions (except for the initial range)

> ③ **Band Gap:** Energy required to transition electrons from valence band to conduction band

> ④ Energy bands further categorized into valence band and conduction band

> ⑤ (Note) Valence and Conduction Bands of a Single Atom

>> ○ Magnesium atom's valence band includes 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s orbitals

>> ○ Magnesium atom's conduction band includes 3p, 4s, 3d orbitals beyond 3s

## **5\. E-k Diagram**

<br>

<img width="584" height="499" alt="스크린샷 2025-12-29 오전 11 52 17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2226cdd3-5e8f-4dcc-8f40-1b8bf3e4cebe" />

**Figure 4.** E-k Diagram 

<br>

 ⑴ k ∈ [-π / (a + b), π / (a + b)]

 ⑵ At k = 0, ± π / (a + b), the slope of the E-k diagram is zero: this is observed not only in the Kronig–Penney model but also in real materials.

 ⑶ E-k solutions outside the range selected by periodicity overlap with solutions within the selected range

 ⑷ Only two k values possible per allowed energy (due to bilateral symmetry at the origin)

 ⑸ When expanding the E-k diagram, it resembles a parabola and converges as energy increases

<br>

<img width="410" height="393" alt="스크린샷 2025-12-29 오전 11 56 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b2e5220-6a13-4f75-a4e7-45ca480a1c52" />

**Figure 5.** Expanded E-k Diagram 

<br>

 ⑹ The actual E-k diagram is very complex, but near the band edges it generally takes a parabolic shape at both the top and the bottom of the band.

 ⑺ Free particles also have a parabolic E-k diagram (since E ∝ p<sup>2</sup>, p ∝ k)

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Meaning of k**

 ⑴ For free particles, k = wavenumber, hk = momentum p

 ⑵ For periodic potential, k = wavenumber, hk = crystal momentum

 ⑶ Represents a constant related to interactions and momentum within the crystal, not actual electron momentum

<br>

<br>

## **7\. Introduction to Effective Mass Concept**

 ⑴ [Effective Mass](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1329)

 ⑵ Near the bottom of all bands in E-k diagram, the curvature is downward **:** m<sub>eff</sub> 0 (electrons)

 ⑶ Near the top of all bands in E-k diagram, the curvature is upward **:** meff < 0 (holes)

 ⑷ Near the band edges, the dispersion is generally parabolic → taking the second derivative gives a constant → therefore the effective mass is constant.

## **8\. Carriers and Current**

 ⑴ N atoms per band, 2 electrons per atom, at room temperature

<br>

<img width="522" height="513" alt="스크린샷 2025-12-29 오후 12 03 20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f0ff8ce-b2cc-4e8c-89fa-31aa9bd78e62" />

**Figure 7.** N atoms per band, 2 electrons per atom, at room temperature 

<br>

 ⑵ Band 4: All empty

 ⑶ Band 3: Mostly empty

 ⑷ Band 2: Mostly full

 ⑸ Band 1: All full

 ⑹ Band 4 has no electrons, net current = 0

 ⑺ Band 1 is fully occupied by electrons, net current = 0

 ⑻ Bands 2 and 3 must break symmetry for net current to exist

<br>

<br>

## **9\. Applications**

 ⑴ Why graphite conducts electricity: Electrons can move easily from HOMO to LUMO, similar to Na

 ⑵ Na has higher electrical conductivity than Mg: in metallic bonding, the orbitals form a single band.
