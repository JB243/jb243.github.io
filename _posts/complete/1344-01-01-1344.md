<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9c526f6-d1c7-4376-bbe2-4375b9e27b45)

<br>

> ② Characteristics

>> ○ State function: Enthalpy is only a function of **temperature**. It remains constant if the initial and final temperatures are the same

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a7c97ef-6c06-4612-af67-65f056782aa4)

<br>

>> ○ Enthalpy has no absolute value, so the change in enthalpy (ΔH) is important

>> ○ If a reaction proceeds in reverse, the sign of ΔH is reversed

>> ○ Magnitude property: Proportional to the quantity of substance

>> ○ Measured with simple calorimeter at constant pressure: C<sub>P</sub> is the heat capacity at constant pressure, but dh = mC<sub>P</sub>dT holds even when pressure is not constant

> ③ Reaction Enthalpy

>> ○ Formation enthalpy (ΔH<sub>f</sub>): Enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance is formed from stable elements

>>> ○ **Formula 1.** Formation enthalpy of a diatomic gas (e.g., O<sub>2</sub>(_g_)) = 0

>>> ○ **Formula 2.** Formation enthalpy of a metallic crystal (e.g., Mg(_s_)) = 0

>> ○ Decomposition enthalpy (-ΔH<sub>f</sub>): Enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance is decomposed into stable elements

>> ○ Bond dissociation enthalpy (ΔH<sub>D</sub>): Enthalpy change when a substance is decomposed into gaseous atoms that make up the substance

>>> ○ Reaction where bonds are broken is endothermic

>> ○ Combustion enthalpy (ΔH<sub>C</sub>): Enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance is completely combusted

>> ○ Solvation enthalpy

>>> ○ ΔH<sub>sol</sub> = ΔH<sub>lattice</sub> + ΔH<sub>hydration</sub>

>>> ○ ΔH<sub>sol</sub>: MN(_s_) → M<sup>+</sup>(_aq_) + N<sup>-</sup>(_aq_)

>>> ○ ΔH<sub>lattice</sub> (＞ 0): MN(s) → M<sup>+</sup>(_g_) + N<sup>-</sup>(_g_)

>>>> ○ Absolute value of lattice enthalpy is larger for smaller metal ions and larger charges on individual ions

>>> ○ ΔH<sub>hydration</sub> (＜ 0): M<sup>+</sup>(_g_) + N<sup>-</sup>(_g_) → M<sup>+</sup>(_aq_) \+ N<sup>-</sup>(_aq_)

>> ○ Lattice energy: Refers to the enthalpy change when each constituent element is split into gaseous monoatomic ions.

>>> ○ **Example 1.** Lattice energy of NaF(_s_) ΔH ⇔ NaF(_s_) → Na<sup>+</sup>(_g_) + F<sup>-</sup>(_g_), ΔH

>> ○ Born-Haber Cycle: A hypothetical reaction pathway used to explain the formation of ionic compounds.

>> ○ Hess's Law: Since enthalpy is a state function, if the reactants and products are the same, the ΔH is the same regardless of the pathway taken.

> ⑤ Other

>> ○ Slope on the heating curve

>>> ○ Solid: Since intermolecular forces between molecules are almost not broken, heat is transferred as kinetic energy of motion.

>>> ○ Liquid: Some energy is used to break intermolecular forces between molecules. The slope is **smallest**.

>>> ○ Gas: No intermolecular forces between molecules. Heat is transferred as kinetic energy of motion. The slope is **largest**.

>> ○ Relationship with internal energy

>>> ○ Gas reactions: If there is no change in the gas molar ratio between reactants and products, ΔH = ΔU.

## **3\. Second Law of Thermodynamics**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Entropy: A state function that represents disorder.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b80dfdff-448d-4315-b891-cb8e8492a768)

<br>

> ② Reversible process: A process with a total entropy change of 0.

> ③ The second law of thermodynamics can be expressed in four different ways.

 ⑵ **Expression 1**

> ① Spontaneous change: Change that occurs without external influence.

> ② Law: Spontaneous changes occur in the direction of increasing the universe's entropy.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92dc805c-1526-47fc-a154-047bfbb883a9)

<br>

> ③ Surroundings' entropy ΔS<sub>surroundings</sub>: Independent of whether the reaction is reversible or irreversible.

>> ○ The application of the second law of thermodynamics is possible only when an isolated system is formed by the system of interest and its surroundings.

>> ○ Calculation of ΔS<sub>surroundings</sub>: Independent of reversible **·** irreversible reactions. Assumes constant temperature and pressure in the surroundings.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfb8452b-2afa-4000-af72-574e7c2e722b)

<br>

>> ○ Although ΔS<sub>surroundings</sub> is not as simple as described above, it is important to note that it is composed of values derivable from the system.

> ④ Conclusion: If ΔS<sub>total</sub> > 0, spontaneous; if ΔS<sub>total</sub> < 0, non-spontaneous.

 ⑶ **Expression 2:** Clausius Inequality

> ① Clausius's expression: Heat flows from hot to cold. It cannot spontaneously flow from cold to hot.

> ② Formulation (with equality condition for reversible processes)

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7996d9ce-3fa2-4842-a25d-99aa25a4d65c)

<br>

> ③ Proof

>> ○ To do work on the system, the external pressure must be increased along with the rise in external pressure.

>> ○ Therefore, the reversible condition does more work on the surroundings than the irreversible condition.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35f1299e-bcb2-40af-bd0a-133448ce60b2)

<br>

>> ○ If the initial and final states of reversible and irreversible processes are the same (applying physical representation),

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17d5cc64-4ea1-4a41-b3d2-c98838c65e20)

<br>

>> ○ Hence, the following equation is obtained.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/344a7327-eb23-4392-be93-5b4f66a8d08f)

<br>

> ④ Derivation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics: If the system is isolated from the surroundings, dq = 0, so dS ≥ 0.

> ⑤ Free Expansion

>> ○ Free expansion and isothermal expansion have the same entropy change intuitively.

>> ○ In free expansion, there is no heat exchange.

>> ○ In free expansion, since it's not a reversible process, the above formula cannot be applied.

 ⑷ **Expression 3:** [Carnot Engine](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1345)

> ① Kelvin-Planck's expression: It's impossible to create a heat engine that converts all absorbed heat into work.

> ② In other words, an engine with 100% efficiency cannot be created.

> ③ Carnot engine efficiency is 70%: With 100 units of heat, only 70 units can be converted into work.

 ⑸ **Expression 4:** Statistical Mechanical Definition

> ① Defined by Boltzmann's equation, also known as Boltzmann entropy.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed2f7a05-0881-4105-8e33-6bafb33fce93)

<br>

> ② State number W: Number of ways the molecules of the system can be arranged while keeping the total energy constant.

>> ○ Positional probability: The greater the disorder of molecular arrangement, the more cases there are in that direction for the reaction to proceed.

>> ○ Molecular motion states: More cases for molecular arrangement occur at different energy levels, preferred at higher temperatures → Entropy increases with higher temperatures.

>> ○ Absolute value of entropy and definition of entropy at 0 can be defined → Third Law of Thermodynamics.

> ③ Equivalence of Thermodynamic and Statistical Mechanical Definitions

>> ○ Assume that the microscopic state number given to a single molecule is proportional to its volume.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e23c2a2-0985-407c-95bb-5c2e7b3f60cf)

<br>

>> ○ For N molecules, the total state number is represented as follows

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94b7ff0c-8019-4c93-83e8-4399b7e63a88)

<br>

>> ○ The statistical entropy during isothermal expansion of an ideal gas from V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>2</sub> is as follows:

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31020ef2-66d2-4c2d-b759-8a36bcc770df)

<br>

>> ○ Ultimately, the definition of statistical entropy is equivalent to the definition of thermodynamic entropy.

>> ○ It's conjectured that Boltzmann performed reverse calculations to extract profound meaning from thermodynamic definition.

> ④ Classical Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Statistical Mechanics

>> ○ Classical Statistical Mechanics: Initiated by Boltzmann's thermodynamic concepts.

>> ○ Quantum Statistical Mechanics: Characterized by quantum mechanical concepts such as [orbital theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1334).

 ⑹ Application of Entropy

> ① **Application 1:** [General Thermodynamic Process](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1345)

> ② **Application 2:** Predicting Entropy Change in Gas Reactions

>> ○ Reaction entropy ΔS: In reactions where the number of gas molecules increases, ΔS > 0.

> ③ **Application 3:** Expansion in Vacuum

>> ○ ΔT = 0, W = 0 → Q = 0

>> ○ Thermodynamic definition doesn't apply in this situation.

>> ○ Approaching the problem with the concept of state number from statistical mechanics is similar to isothermal expansion.

> ⑤ **Application 5:** The reason time flows in one direction is related to the second law of thermodynamics.

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Third Law of Thermodynamics**

 ⑴ Nernst's Heat Theorem

> ① **Expression 1:** Entropy change associated with physical or chemical changes approaches 0 as temperature approaches absolute zero.

> ② **Expression 2:** The entropy of all perfect crystalline substances is 0 at T = 0.

 ⑵ Residual Entropy

> ① The entropy actually measured at T = 0.

> ② **Example 1:** Residual entropy of CO: Random orientation allows relatively free motion, increasing residual entropy.

>> ○ Considering two CO molecules, CO ··· CO and CO ··· OC are two possible arrangements. According to Boltzmann's statistical definition, the absolute entropy is k ln (2×2) = k ln 4. When expanded to 1 mole (6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup> molecules), the predicted residual entropy is S = N<sub>A</sub>kln2 = 5.76 J/K. The actual measured value is 4.6 J/K, which is quite similar.

> ③ **Example 2:** Residual entropy of HCl: Only one type of arrangement is possible, making the residual entropy close to 0.

 ⑶ Standard Molar Entropy

> ① Absolute zero: Defines the entropy of a pure solid crystal as 0 at 0 K.

> ② Calculation of standard molar entropy of substances

<br>

> ③ **Characteristic 1:** S<sub>m</sub>(s) < S<sub>m</sub>(ℓ) < S<sub>m</sub>(g): Entropy becomes more disordered as it goes from solid to gas.

> ④ **Characteristic 2:** Molar entropy of heavy elements is higher than that of light elements.

> ⑤ **Characteristic 3:** Larger and more complex chemical species have higher molar entropy than smaller and simpler ones.

## **5\. Gibbs Free Energy** (G)

 ⑴ Definition: A state function that indicates the spontaneity of a reaction.

<br>

<br>

> ① Applying the second law of thermodynamics requires considering both the system and the surroundings, which is cumbersome.

> ② Gibbs free energy requires only the properties of the system to judge the spontaneity of the reaction, making it easier.

>> ○ (Note) If properties of the system and surroundings are considered separately, the calculation process becomes more complicated.

> ③ **Meaning 1:** ΔG < 0 indicates a spontaneous reaction, ΔG > 0 indicates a non-spontaneous reaction, ΔG = 0 indicates equilibrium.

> ④ **Meaning 2:** For a **constant temperature and pressure**, the maximum reversible work obtainable from a reaction.

> ⑤ Limitation: The change in the surroundings' entropy is not that simple.

>> ○ Example of solution (for isothermal processes)

>>> ○ According to the [osmotic pressure](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1342) formula, pressure and concentration have the following relationship (where C is molarity):

<br>

>>> ○ The slope of the reaction path - free energy curve is ΔG<sub>r</sub>

>>> ○ At the initial stage of the reaction where there are no products, the forward reaction proceeds, so ΔG<sub>r</sub> ＜ 0

>>> ○ As the reaction progresses, G<sub>r</sub> increases (∵ Q increases) and reaches equilibrium where ΔG<sub>r</sub> = 0 (forward reaction = reverse reaction)

>>> ○ Equilibrium point is where the slope is zero

> ④ Application: van't Hoff equation

>> ○ Introduction: To go beyond isothermal process constraints, linear approximation is used to estimate changes in free energy
