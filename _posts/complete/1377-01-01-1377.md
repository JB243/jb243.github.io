⑵ **Common Reaction Principles**

> ① Nucleophilic attack, Electrophilic attack

> ② Proton transfer: Occurs intermolecularly, not intramolecularly

> ③ Tautomeric equilibrium: Enol ↔ Ketone

> ④ Work-up: Useful keyword for purification without specifying exact acid or base

⑶ Reactivity Comparison

> ① Carbonyl compound reactivity comparison

>> ○ **acyl halide** ＞ acid anhydride ＞ aldehyde ＞ ketone ＞ ester ~ carboxylic acid ＞ amide ＞ carboxylate ion

> ② Ketone reactivity comparison based on functional groups

**Figure 1.** Ketone reactivity comparison based on functional groups

<br>

>> ○ Aldehydes are more reactive, electrophilic, and have higher combustion heat than ketones

>> ○ **Reason 1:** Steric hindrance: More substituents hinder nucleophilic attack, reducing nucleophilicity

>> ○ **Reason 2:** Inductive effect: Substituents provide electron density to ketone carbon via hyperconjugation

> ③ Other Comparisons

>> ○ Reactions involving aldehydes and ketones are quite similar

>> ○ Ketones are more polar than aldehydes

>>> ○ Reason: Ketones stabilize carbocations in resonance contributors by methyl groups

>> ○ Aliphatic ketones are more reactive than aromatic ketones

>> ○ Differences in reactivity between aldehydes and ketones are observed in oxidation-reduction reactions

>>> ○ Reason: Aldehydes can undergo further oxidation, whereas ketones cannot be further oxidized

>>> ○ Example: Silver mirror reaction, Fehling's reaction, Benedict's reaction only occur with aldehydes

## **2\. Nucleophilic Addition Reactions**

⑴ Overview

> ① Bürgi–Dunitz angle: Angle at which nucleophile's HOMO approaches the antibonding orbital (LUMO) of the carbonyl group

> ② Acidic conditions: Increase carbonyl's electrophilicity

> ③ Basic conditions: Increase nucleophilicity of the nucleophile

> ④ Halide ions do not act as nucleophiles toward carbonyl compounds

⑵ **Type 1.** When the Basicity of Y<sup>-</sup> is Greater than that of X<sup>-</sup>

> ① Overview

>> ○ **Type 1** is frequently observed in acyl chlorides

>> ○ Carboxylic acids also often show behavior similar to **Type 1**

>> ○ Cases of aldehydes and ketones reacting as **Type 1** are rare

**Figure 8.** Example of acetal formation reaction

<br>

>>> ○ Acetal formation reaction has reverse reaction under the same conditions

>>> ○ Dean-stark trap removes H<sub>2</sub>O, increasing yield since H<sub>2</sub>O is a product of the reaction

>>> ○ Solvent: Azeotropic solvents like toluene, xylene with high boiling points and constant boiling points are used ( **∵** [Dean-stark trap](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1444) necessary condition)

>>> ○ Excess alcohol as a reactant increases yield → usually added in excess instead of 2 equivalents

>>> ○ Esters, carboxylic acids, and amides do not form acetals under typical acidic conditions

 **Figure 13.** Enamine formation reaction

<br>

>>> ○ Secondary amines lack a proton to remove from the iminium ion, unlike primary amines, so the hydrogen attached to the alpha carbon is removed.

>>> ○ Since C=N bond strength is greater than C=C bond strength, imine formation occurs during primary amine addition

**Figure 29.** Wittig reaction example

<br>

>> ○ Advantages: Alkene with fewer substituents becomes the sole product

>> ○ Disadvantages: Wittig reaction generates alkenes without (E)/(Z) selectivity, while **Figure 27.** does show selectivity, making it worth noting

>> ○ Solution

>>> ○ If the ylide nucleophile's carbon is attached to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), the reactivity is low, so thermodynamically stable alkene is predominantly formed.

>>> ○ If the ylide nucleophile's carbon is attached to a phenyl group, the kinetically favored (less sterically hindered) alkene is predominantly formed.

>>> ○ Under peroxy acid, excess oxygen is transferred to an aldehyde (or ketone) to produce a carboxylic acid (or ester).

>>> ○ Retention of configuration during rearrangement.

>>> ○ Migratory aptitude

>>>> ○ H ＞phenyl ＞ tertiary alkyl ＞ cyclohexyl ＞ secondary alkyl ＞ primary alkyl ＞ methyl

>>>> ○ Oxygen insertion occurs towards electron-rich carbon ([ref](https://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/baeyer-villiger-oxidation.shtm))

>> ○ **1-1.** acetophenone: Benzene ring enhances reactivity

>>> ○ Acetophenone reacts with peroxidic acid (RO<sub>3</sub>H), e.g. CF3CO<sub>3</sub>H, to form phenyl acetate
