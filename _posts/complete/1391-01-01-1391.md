## **3. Protein Primary Structure**

⑴ Amino acid sequence

⑵ Planar nature of peptide bonds

> ① Amide plane: Forms a peptide bond. Involves C, O, N, H between two alpha carbons

> ② Naming of various bonds in the same plane

>> ○ Φ bond: N - C<sub>α</sub> bond

>> ○ ψ bond: C<sub>α</sub> - C bond

>> ○ ω bond: C - N bond

>> ○ χ bond: C<sub>α</sub> - R (side chain) bond

> ③ The C=O bond exhibits resonance with the ω bond, resulting in the C=O and C-N bonds having 1.5 bonds each, which prevents rotation and fixes their positions.

## **4. Protein Secondary Structure (Chou-Fasman rule)**

⑴ The hydrogen bonds between the backbone of amino acids (between H and O) result in a three-dimensional coiling or folding structure of the amino acid sequence.

⑵ **Alpha helix**

<br>

**Figure 3.** Alpha helix structure

<br>

> ① Hydrogen bonds between C=O of nth amino acid and N-H of n+4th amino acid

> ② Resilient, right-handed helix

> ③ Characteristics: Hydrogen bonds are present within amino acids, but not between amino acids

> ④ Hydrophilic amino acids have attractive and repulsive forces that interfere with the formation of alpha helices.

>> ○ Conclusion: Hydrophobic amino acids mainly form alpha helices

>> ○ Frequently observed in membrane-spanning proteins

> ⑤ Gly: Side chain R is a hydrogen, preventing proper alpha helix formation due to its small size

> ⑥ Pro: Forms an imino group, limiting hydrogen bonding → prevents alpha helix formation

⑶ **Beta pleated sheet**

<br>

> ① Characteristics: In addition to hydrogen bonds between the amino acid backbone, there are also hydrogen bonds between the amino acid side chains.

> ② Common in fibrous proteins like silk

> ③ Spider silk combines beta pleated sheet with alpha helix

⑷ Ramachandran plot

## **5. Protein Tertiary Structure**

⑴ Overall three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide

⑵ Different structures arise due to interactions between R groups. Differences in structure determine properties

⑶ Ionic bonds

⑷ Covalent Bond

⑸ Disulfide Bridge: Contributes to a more stable conformation

> ① Reducing Agent: Breaks disulfide bridges. Examples: β-mercaptoethanol, DTT (dithiothreitol)

> ② Disulfide bridge is formed in endoplasmic reticulum for eukaryotic cells. 

> ③ Disulfide bridge is formed by PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) in the cytoplasm for prokaryotic cells.

> ④ **Anfinsen's Experiment**

>> ○ NEM (N-ethylmaleimide): Covalently bonds to the -SH group of cysteine that do not participate in disulfide bonds.

>> ○ DTT (including β-mercaptoethanol): -S-S- → -SH + HS-. Functions as a reducing agent to break disulfide bonds.

>> ○ NEM* → DTT → NEM: Quantifies the initially present SH groups. * indicates radioactive isotope.

>> ○ NEM → DTT → NEM*: Quantifies the initially present -S-S- bonds. * indicates radioactive isotope.

>> ○ **Conclusion 1:** When denaturing factors are removed, proteins revert to their original structure.

>> ○ **Conclusion 2:** Disulfide bridges contribute irreversibly to the formation of conformation, requiring precise control.
