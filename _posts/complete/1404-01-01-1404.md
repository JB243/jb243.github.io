## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Photoelectron Spectroscopy: Observing electron transitions by X-rays

⑵ Raman Spectroscopy: Emitting visible light lasers and observing changes in wavelength

⑶ Infrared Spectroscopy: Observing molecular vibrations by infrared. Observing how much the same wavelength of infrared is observed after irradiating infrared

⑷ Microwave Spectroscopy: Observing molecular rotations by microwaves

⑸ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: Observing nuclear spin transitions by radio waves

⑹ Here are some tips for solving spectroscopy problems:

> ① **Consider the [Degree of Unsaturation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1356#3-degree-of-unsaturation-ihd-index-of-hydrogen-deficiency) First**: If the degree of unsaturation is 4 or higher, the presence of a benzene ring is strongly suspected.

> ② **Focus on <sup>1</sup>H [NMR](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1404#5-nuclear-magnetic-resonance-nmr-spectroscopy)**: It's recommended to solve problems primarily using 1H NMR, as it can be approached like solving a math problem and provides a substantial amount of information.

> ③ **Use the Chemical Formula to Narrow Down Possibilities**: It's advisable to deduce possible structures based on the given chemical formula.

> ④ **Utilize Symmetry**: Taking advantage of symmetry can make solving problems significantly easier.

> ⑤ **Differentiate cis/trans Alkenes with 1H NMR**: The cis/trans isomers of alkenes can be distinguished using <sup>1</sup>H NMR.

> ⑥ **Chemical Shifts of Hydrogens on the Same Carbon**: Hydrogens attached to the same carbon can have different chemical shift values (ppm) in <sup>1</sup>H NMR depending on their spatial arrangement.

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. entrance region

>> ○ **1-1.** Sample molecules are introduced: Molecules are mostly neutral

>> ○ **1-2.** Molecules pass through metal plates with positive potential

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. ionization region

>> ○ **2-1.** In a mass spectrometer, electrons with an energy of 70 eV are emitted through an electron beam.

>> ○ **2-2.** Ionization stage: Organic molecules colliding with high-energy electrons lose one electron and form molecular ions

>>> ○ Mass of molecular ion = Molecular weight

>>> ○ Molecular ion takes radical form: Can be expressed as M<sup>+ㆍ</sup>

>> ○ **2-3.** Fragmentation: Molecular ions are very unstable, breaking into radical parts and positively charged parts

>>> ○ Preferred fragmentation reactions exist depending on the functional groups

>>> ○ Fragmentation of polypeptides: b represents a fragment with NH2 at the end, and y represents a fragment with -COOH at the end

<br>

>>> ○ When two peaks differ exactly by 28 Da, it is estimated to be an a-b pair or an x-y pair

>>> ○ The a ion appears less frequently than the b ion: C≡O<sup>+</sup> is more unstable than C=N<sup>+</sup>

>> ○ **2-4.** Generation of 1+, 2+ ions, etc.: Generally, 1+ ions are formed

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. acceleration region

>> ○ **3-1.** The electric field is formed due to the metal plates, each with zero and negative potential, along with the metal plate in the front with positive potential.

>> ○ **3-2.** Positively charged molecules are accelerated according to the electric field

>> ○ Only positively charged chemical species reach the recorder

<br>

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. drift region

>> ○ Positively charged molecules move in a straight line in the drift region where there is no electric field when passing through metal plates with negative potential

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. detector region

>> ○ **Type 1:** Reflectron mode: See **Figure 1.**

>>> ○ Principle: [Lorentz Force](https://jb243.github.io/pages/751)

>>> ○ In other words, when ions pass through a magnetic field, they can reach the detector differently depending on their m/z ratios.

>> ○ **Type 2:** Linear mode

>>> ○ A representative example is quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS).

>>> ○ In QMS, an oscillating electric field is provided through RF (radio frequency), allowing ions to reach the detector differently depending on their m/z ratios.

>> ○ **Principle 1:** Time-of-Flight (TOF) Mass Analyzer

>>> ○ Utilizes the principle that ions of different masses take different times to reach the detector based on m/z

>>> ○ In other words, ions with smaller masses reach the detector faster than ions with larger masses.

>>> ○ **Advantages:** Less affected by salts or other contaminants

>>> ○ **Disadvantages:** Mass resolution can reach up to 60,000 at m/z = 200.

>> ○ **Principle 2.** FT-ICR-MS (Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer)

>>> ○ m/z values can be determined using a Penning ion trap.

>>> ○ Utilizes the fact that charged particles undergo circular motion at a specific angular frequency in a magnetic field in a cyclotron (Principle: [Lorentz force](https://jb243.github.io/pages/751#4-applications)) 

<br>

<br>

>>> ○ Converts oscillating signals over time into a mass spectrum using FFT.

>>> ○ **Advantage:** Mass resolution can reach up to 1,000,000  

>>> ○ **Disadvantage:** Due to the high resolution, it requires direct sample infusion and is relatively slow.

>> ○ **Principle 3.** Orbitrap

>>> ○ Similar to FT-ICR-MS, ions oscillate inside an ion trap (barrel-shaped), and their oscillating signals over time are converted into a mass spectrum using FFT.

>>> ○ Unlike FT-ICR-MS, it uses an electric field formed between inner and outer electrodes instead of a magnetic field.

>>> ○ Mass resolution can reach up to 240,000.

>> ○ **Principle 4:** Liquid Chromatography (LC) Analyzer

>> ○ Specific m/z can be selectively accepted, not the entire m/z (e.g., MS/MS)

>> ○ A single substance can produce multiple ions, thus having multiple m/z values: Deconvolution algorithm creates a single peak

⑵ Interpretation of Mass Analysis

> ① The highest peak in mass analysis is called the base peak

> ② The intensity of the base peak is set as 100, and the others are measured as relative values.

> ③ Example of m/z: The more stable the positive chemical species, the larger the peak

**Figure 4.** Example of m/z 

<br>

> ④ Nitrogen rule

>> ○ Hydrocarbons composed of C, H, O elements always have even molecular weights, so molecular ions are even in m/z ratio.

>> ○ If an odd-numbered molecular ion in m/z ratio is observed in organic molecules, it can be assumed to contain an odd number of nitrogen atoms.

>> ○ **Example:** The odd m/z in the **Figure 4** is due to not considering proton transfer. Refer to MALDI-TOF.

>>> ○ CH<sub>4</sub>: 16

>>> ○ C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>: Even

>>> ○ C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>: Even

>>> ○ C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub>: Even

>>> ○ When substituting -H with -OH, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -SH, -SiH<sub>3</sub> groups: Even

>>> ○ When substituting -H with -NH<sub>2</sub> group: Odd

>>>> ○ Labeling stage: **Protein**

>>>> ○ **Disadvantage 1.** Difficult to separate target protein and streptavidin

>>>> ○ **Disadvantage 2.** Because the biotin tag is more prone to fragmentation than the protein, signal interference due to biotin can occur.

>>>> ○ **Absolute Quantification Principle**: Measure the charge amount of the reporter group in each extract

>>>> ○ Labeling stage: **Peptide**

>>>> ○ Advantages: Comparatively flexible multiplexing is possible. Both relative and absolute quantification are feasible

>>> ○ MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring)

>>> ○ TMT (Tandem Mass Tags)

>> ○ **2-2.** Label-Free

⑺ Applications: MS/MS (MS<sup>2</sup>, Tandem Mass Spectrometry)

> ① Definition: Combination of two mass spectrometers

>> ○ Generally utilizes triple-quadrupole structure (linear detector mode)

>> ○ **Component 1:** MS1 (quadrupole structure; Q1): Separates ion X with specific m/z after ionizing the given sample

>>> ○ Ion that passes through MS1 is referred to as **precursor ion**

>> ○ **Component 2:** Fragmentation part (quadrupole structure; Q2): Breaks down ion X with specific m/z into smaller fragments

>>> ○ Methods like CID (collision-induced dissociation), ion-molecule reaction, photodissociation are used in **Component 2**

>> ○ **Component 3:** MS2 (quadrupole structure; Q3): Separates fragments with specific m/z

>>> ○ Ion that passes through MS2 is referred to as **product ion**

## **3\. Infrared Spectroscopy** (IR spectrum)

⑴ Definition

> ① Experimental method for analyzing functional groups of compounds by analyzing the absorption wavelengths of infrared radiation

> ② Used in pH sensors, etc.

> ③ Models for predicting IR spectra using AI are being developed

⑵ Vibrations: Oscillation of electrons, categorized into stretching vibrations and bending vibrations

> ① Infrared absorption wavelengths are in the mid-infrared range (2,500-8,000 nm)

> ② Mid-infrared light has a high absorption rate and weak signal strength, so near-infrared light is generally used instead.

> ③ Attempts are being made to utilize mid-infrared

⑶ **Type 1:** Stretching vibrations

> ① Definition: Temporary transfer of electrons from an atom with high electronegativity to an atom with lower electronegativity

> ② Types: Symmetric stretch, asymmetric stretch

> ③ Most IR spectroscopy is related to stretching vibrations

> ④ Atoms with dipole moments absorb infrared radiation and reduce the size of the dipole moment

>> ○ Similarly, there must be a change in dipole moment for infrared absorption in IR spectroscopy.

> ⑤ Infrared absorption wavelengths are quantized

> ⑥ In IR, infrared absorption lines are represented as wavenumbers (cm<sup>-1</sup>), the reciprocal of wavelength in centimeters, generally ranging from 4000-400 cm<sup>-1</sup>

>> ○ 521 cm<sup>-1</sup> refers to 521 waves per centimeter

> ⑦ **Factor 1:** Stronger bonds require more energy, leading to increased wavenumbers

>> ○ E = hν (where ν is wavenumber) closely related

>> ○ C≡C ＞ C=C ＞ C-C

>> ○ C=O bond in 2-pentanone is a double bond, leading to observation of wavenumber 1720 cm<sup>-1</sup>.

>> ○ C=O bond in 2-cyclohexanone has lower degree than 2 due to resonance, leading to observation of wavenumber 1680 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which is less than 1720 cm<sup>-1</sup>.

> ⑧ **Factor 2:** Smaller atoms have less electron dispersion, leading to increased wavenumbers

> ⑨ **Factor 3:** Larger dipoles indicate stronger bonds, leading to increased wavenumbers

>> ○ O-H ＞ N-H ＞ C-H

>> ○ Here, dipole refers to dipole in a single bond, not the dipole of the entire molecule ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1865))

**Figure 10.** A example comparison of C=O stretching vibration wavenumbers

<br>

>>> ○ The right structure has a higher wavenumber from C=O stretching vibration.

>>> ○ <b>Reason 1:</b> Due to [hybridization effects](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1355#5-acid-base-theory), electrons move from the methyl group (sp<sup>3</sup>) to the ketone carbon (sp<sup>2</sup>) → bond energy increases → wavenumber (ν = E/h) increases.

>>> ○ <b>Reason 2:</b> When electrons are delocalized by the benzene ring, the resonance wavelength increases, and the wavenumber decreases (cf. [particle in a box](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1329#4-particle-in-a-box-generally-particle-in-one-dimensional-box)).

>>> ○ The relationship between wavenumber and dipole moment seems to be limited to single bonds because, in the left structure, 1) the dipole intermediate is stabilized, and 2) the distance between the dipoles is greater, resulting in a larger dipole moment for the left structure.

<br>

<img width="673" alt="스크린샷 2024-11-21 오후 11 34 20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d84f4c0-4bfe-496c-ae3b-a4641492d81a">

**Figure 11.** The reason the left structure has a larger dipole moment

<br>

> ⑩ **Factor 4:** When hydrogen bonding is present, because intermolecular bonds resemble intramolecular bonds and there are a variety of hydrogen bond forms, the absorption lines become very broad.

>> ○ OH bond is observed as a broad spectrum due to hydrogen bonding

## **5\. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**

⑴ Principle

> ① Chemical species with nonzero spin quantum numbers like <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P can be studied using NMR.

> ② Such chemical species exhibit quantized states when subjected to an external magnetic field.

> ③ The electromagnetic waves corresponding to energy differences between these states are radiofrequency waves.

> ④ Information obtained through NMR: Type and number of specific chemical species.

> ⑤ Voxel size in MRI is generally 1 × 1 × 5 mm³, while in MRS it is larger at 15 × 15 × 15 mm³.

⑵ <sup>1</sup>H NMR (Proton NMR)

> ① <sup>1</sup>H possesses two quantized states with respect to the magnetic field B<sub>0</sub>: α-spin state and β-spin state.

<br>

**Figure 23.** Two quantized states with respect to the magnetic field

<br>

> ② Spin flip: When <sup>1</sup>H absorbs energy proportional to the magnetic field strength, it transitions from the α-spin state to the β-spin state.

> ③ **Principle 1.** Integral ratio

>> ○ Integral ratio of NMR signals represents the ratio of equivalent 1H nuclei.

>> ○ Reason: Signal is linearly proportional to the number of equivalent 1H nuclei. Other factors have minimal influence.

> ④ **Principle 2.** Chemical shift

>> ○ **Lenz's Law**: When there's a change in the external magnetic field, electrons induce a magnetic field in the opposite direction to cancel it.

>> ○ **Chemical shielding**: Refers to local variations in the magnetic field, which are proportional to the basic magnetic field B<sub>0</sub>.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26da177b-963a-4184-a7f5-6e33620babcf)

<br>

>>> ○ B<sub>i</sub>: Local magnetic field

>>> ○ σ<sub>i</sub>: Shielding factor reflecting the shielding effect on proton i

>>> ○ Shielding factors are generally small (10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup>), so magnetic field differences are very small.

>>> ○ Using ratios instead of absolute values to reflect magnetic field differences

>>> ○ Calculation of index: The difference between local magnetic field and reference frequency divided by the reference frequency. Commonly expressed in ppm units.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e12d6a9-6a43-42ac-91e2-92e809f7c931)

<br>

>>>> ○ This term representing the magnetic field difference is called chemical shift.

>>>> ○ The value of ω<sub>ref</sub> is arbitrary but often chosen as ω<sub>TR</sub> of the transmitter.

>>>> ○ Main advantage: Independent of B<sub>0</sub>

>>>> ○ **Example:** In a 300 MHz <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, acetone exhibits a single resonance line with a chemical shift δ of 2.0 ppm with reference to tetramethylsilane (TMS). How many Hz away from TMS is this acetone's resonance line? **600 Hz**

>> ○ Protons in an electron-deficient environment experience a strong external magnetic field, resulting in higher resonance frequency and larger δ value.

>>> ○ Protons in an electron-deficient environment are called deshielded protons or downfield protons.

>>> ○ Associated with the deshielding effect

>> ○ Protons in an electron-rich environment experience a weaker external magnetic field, leading to lower resonance frequency and smaller δ value.

>>> ○ Protons in an electron-rich environment are called shielded protons or upfield protons.

>>> ○ Associated with the shielding effect

>> ○ Protons closer to atoms with high electronegativity experience more deshielding, resulting in larger δ values.

>>> ○ Example: In C<span style="color: red;">H</span><sub>3</sub>C<span style="color: blue;">H</span><sub>2</sub>C<span style="color: green;">H</span><sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, δ for <span style="color: red;">H</span> is 1.04 ppm, δ for <span style="color: blue;">H</span> is 2.07 ppm, δ for <span style="color: green;">H</span> is 4.37 ppm.

>>> ○ Example: Methyl proton corresponds to 0.85 ppm, methylene proton corresponds to 1.20 ppm, and methine proton corresponds to 1.55 ppm.

> ⑤ **Principle 3.** Spin-Spin Splitting: Also called coupling, multiplicity.

>> ○  When there are n equivalent 1H atoms around a specific <sup>1</sup>H atom, the NMR signal of that <sup>1</sup>H atom splits into n+1 peaks and follows a binomial distribution.

>> ○ **Background 1.** Each neighboring <sup>1</sup>H can adopt one of two spin states: α-spin state or β-spin state.

>> ○ **Background 2.** The state of each neighboring <sup>1</sup>H affects the NMR signal of the specific <sup>1</sup>H.

>> ○ _ortho_ hydrogen > _meta_ hydrogen > _para_ hydrogen in terms of splitting influence: That is, the impact magnitude is increasing as they get closer.

<br>

>> ○ When only _ortho_ hydrogens are present

>>> ○ NMR signal from that <sup>1</sup>H is split into a total of n+1 signals, and the relative size of the k-th signal is proportional to binomial coefficients <sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub>.

>>> ○ Depending on the number of splittings, signals are classified as singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, quintet, sextet, septet, octet, nonet, etc.

<br>

>> ○ Right (6.5-8 ppm) ＞ Center (5.3 ppm) ＞ Left (2.4 ppm)

>> ○ **Benzyl proton:** The circulating electrons create a magnetic field in the same direction as the external magnetic field → Higher resonance frequency and δ value.

>> ○ **Alkene proton:** Electron motion generates a magnetic field in the same direction as the external magnetic field → Higher resonance frequency and δ value.

>> ○ **Alkyne proton:** Only induced magnetic field opposite to the external magnetic field according to Lenz's Law → Lower resonance frequency and δ value.

⑵ Inelastic Scattering: Also known as Raman scattering

> ① Definition: Scattering with energy change. Incident and scattered wavelengths are different.

> ② Raman shift is used to denote how much the wavelength has shifted from Rayleigh scattering.

>> ○ Unlike IR spectroscopy, it doesn't directly measure vibrational energy.

>> ○ Raman shift is measured in cm<sup>-1</sup>.

> ③ Quantum mechanical understanding: Energy difference before and after Raman scattering corresponds to molecular vibrational energy.

>> ○ When a molecule gains energy, it's called Stokes scattering.

>> ○ When a molecule loses energy, it's called anti-Stokes scattering.

>> ○ Stokes scattering is generally more prominent than anti-Stokes scattering because ground state molecules outnumber vibrationally excited molecules.

⑷ Spectroscopic Process

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Monochromatic light is directed onto the sample.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Both Raman-scattered light and Rayleigh-scattered light pass through a notch filter, mostly containing Rayleigh scattering.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The notch filter selectively blocks Rayleigh-scattered light.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Raman-scattered light that passes through the notch filter is separated by a grating based on its wavelength.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. The specific wavelength Raman-scattered light is read by a CCD.
