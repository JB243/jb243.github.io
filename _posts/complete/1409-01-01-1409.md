## **2. Structure 1. Endomembrane**

⑴ Nuclear envelope (plasma membrane or cell membrane)

> ① Composition: Lipids, proteins

> ② Functions: Material transport, shape maintenance, signal transduction, muscle contraction, nerve stimulation

>> ○ Membrane structure: 【Phospholipid head - Hydrophobic tail】 + 【Hydrophobic tail - Phospholipid head】

>> ○ Spontaneous membrane formation by phospholipid bilayer: Phosphate heads face the aqueous surface, and hydrophobic tails point toward the interior of the membrane.

>> ○ Fluid mosaic model

>>> ○ Membrane proteins move within the fluid phospholipid bilayer like a mosaic.

>>> ○ Revealed by FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) and FLIP (Fluorescence Loss In Photobleaching) experiments.

>>> ○ Lateral movement of the membrane: 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> times per second.

> ③ Membrane permeability

>> ○ Non-charged, lipid-soluble substances diffuse through the membrane.

>> ○ Selective permeability: Water-soluble molecules cannot pass through.

>> ○ Reason: Hydrophobic molecules can pass through the cell membrane via simple diffusion, as the hydrophobic tails are longer than the hydrophilic heads.

> ④ **Fluidity factor 1:** Transition temperature (T<sub>m</sub>)

>> ○ The temperature at which a rigid cell membrane abruptly transitions to a fluid state.

>> ○ Related to gel-to-sol transition.

> ⑤ **Fluidity factor 2:** Restricted movement of membrane proteins attached to the cytoskeleton (e.g., caveolin).

> ⑥ **Fluidity factor 3:** Restricted movement of membrane proteins due to tight junctions.

> ⑦ **Fluidity factor 4:** Cholesterol

>> ○ Cholesterol: At high temperatures, it restricts the movement of phospholipids, and at low temperatures, it prevents phospholipids from clumping together, helping maintain membrane fluidity. It does not allow the passage of hydrophilic substances.

>> ○ Temperature-Dependent Regulation: Adjusts the content of unsaturated fatty acids (increases fluidity) and the length of fatty acids (decreases fluidity) in phospholipids to regulate membrane fluidity.

<br>

**Table 2.** Content of unsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids

<br>

> ⑧ Asymmetry of phospholipids: Phospholipid vesicles produced in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) are initially symmetrical. Asymmetry is created after vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane through the action of flippases and floppases.

>> ○ Flippase: An enzyme that facilitates the movement of phospholipids from the outer layer to the inner layer. ATP is used.

>> ○ Floppase: An enzyme that facilitates the movement of phospholipids from the inner layer to the outer layer. ATP is used.

>> ○ Examples of [phospholipid asymmetry](https://nate9389.tistory.com/1393).

>> ○ Disruption of asymmetry leads to cell death signaling. The flip-flop process is involved.

> ① Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough ER, RER): The endoplasmic reticulum studded with ribosomes. Responsible for protein secretion.

>> ○ The area where vesicle budding occurs is smooth and lacks ribosomes.

>> ○ **Function 1.** Formation of vesicles and cell membranes.

>> ○ **Function 2.** Primary glycosylation: N-linked protein glycosylation. Asparagine, etc. are involved.

>>> ○ Example: Mannose, blood type

>> ○ **Function 3.** Removal of the endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence: Occurs before the protein is delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum but is generally considered a function of the rough ER.

>> ○ **Function 4.** Disulfide bonding

> ② Smooth ER (SER): The endoplasmic reticulum without ribosomes.

>> ○ **Function 1.** Lipid and phospholipid synthesis, fatty acid elongation, and unsaturation of fatty acids

>>> ○ Typically synthesizes unsaturated fats from saturated fats.

>>> ○ In later stages of SER, SER synthesizes sterols.

>> ○ **Function 2.** Calcium storage (Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump) and release (IP<sub>3</sub> dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel)

>>> ○ Example: Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in muscle

>> ○ **Function 3.** Cytochrom p450

>>> ○ Detoxification by adding -OH groups to lipid-soluble substances for extracellular release.

>>> ○ The -OH group increases reactivity.

>> ○ **Function 4.** Control of blood sugar level

>>> ○ Involves glycogen phosphorylase.

>>> ○ Facilitated by glucose-6-phosphatase (present only in the liver).

> ③ Alcohol breakdown and hangovers

⑸ Golgi apparatus: Absent in red blood cells.

> ① Structure

>> ○ Cisternae structure: CGN (_cis_-Golgi network) + medial + TGN (_trans_-Golgi network)

>> ○ One side continuously receives (_cis_) while the other side continuously sends vesicles (_trans_).

> ② Formation

>> ○ Cisternal maturation model: The _trans_ portion of the Golgi apparatus disappears, and _cis_ becomes _trans_. Vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum become _cis_.

>> ○ Vesicular transport model: Small molecules are transported directly through vesicles without undergoing Golgi maturation, resulting in faster transport.

> ③ Secretion pathways

>> ○ Constitutive secretory pathway: Continuous secretion of membrane proteins and extracellular matrix (e.g., collagen, proteoglycans).

>> ○ Signal-mediated secretory pathway: Secretion of proteins mediated by hormones.

>> ○ Lysosome pathway

> ② Function

>> ○ Digestion of target molecules, damaged receptors, and damaged organelles.

>> ○ Referred to as a "suicide capsule."

> ③ 1<sup>st</sup> step. In the rough endoplasmic reticulum, mannose, a pentose sugar, attaches to the surface of immature lysosomal enzymes (glycosylation). Flippase is involved in this process.

> ④ 2<sup>nd</sup> step.  Immature lysosomal hydrolase enzymes move to the _cis_-Golgi.

> ⑤ 3<sup>rd</sup> step. In the Golgi apparatus, mannose is phosphorylated by UTP to form mannose-6-phosphate (M-6-ⓟ).

> ⑥ 4<sup>th</sup> step. When M-6-ⓟ reaches the trans-Golgi, it binds to M-6-ⓟ receptors on the membrane surface.

>> ○ The binding of M-6-ⓟ to the receptor directs the hydrolase into the lysosome.

> ⑦ 5<sup>th</sup> step. The glycoprotein is enclosed in a vesicle and fuses with a mature endosome derived from the cell membrane.

>> ○ Endosome: A vesicle involved in endocytosis, equipped with an H<sup>+</sup> pump.

>> ○ If the enzyme responsible for tagging proteins with M-6-ⓟ malfunctions, acidic hydrolases cannot be transported to lysosomes.

> ⑧ 6<sup>th</sup> step. Completion of the lysosome: When the H<sup>+</sup> pump activates and lowers the internal pH to 5, M-6-ⓟ is released from the receptor.

> ⑨ 7<sup>th</sup> step. Through phagocytosis, bacteria and other substances enter the cell, forming a phagosome.

> ⑩ 8<sup>th</sup> step. When the phagosome containing organic material encounters the lysosome, it becomes a phagolysosome.

>> ○ Hydrolytic enzymes in lysosomes completely break down organic matter.

>> ○ The low pH inside lysosomes facilitates hydrolysis.

> ⑪ 9<sup>th</sup> step. The remaining debris is expelled from the cell through exocytosis.

> ⑫ Inhibitors

>> ○ Mannan: Inhibitor of mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis.

>> ○ Bafilomycin: Lysosomal inhibitor.

> ⑬ Lysosomal diseases

>> ○ Mechanism: Decreased lysosomal hydrolases → Accumulation of degradation products → Increased lysosome concentration → Influx of water → Lysis → Damage to surrounding cells
