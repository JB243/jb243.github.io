## **1. Classification of Photosynthetic Algae**

 ⑴ Contains chlorophyll a and c

> ① Lacks fucoxanthin: **Bikont algae**

> ② Contains fucoxanthin

>> ○ Contains diatoxanthin: **Diatom**

>> ○ Lacks diatoxanthin: **Brown Algae**

 ⑵ Contains chlorophyll a and d: **Red Algae**

> ① Red algae perform photosynthesis with phycoerythrin and phycocyanin

 ⑶ Contains chlorophyll a and b

> ① Single-celled organisms with eye spots and contractile vacuoles: **Euglenoids**

> ② Multicellular organisms with eye spots and contractile vacuoles: **Green Algae**

<br>

## **2. Brown Algae**

 ⑴ Contains algin and lacks vascular bundles.

 ⑵ Algin: Substance that forms the gel in the cell walls

<br>

<br>

## **3. Green Algae** (Charophyta)

 ⑴ Lacks vascular bundles.

> ① Cannot develop root for absorbing water and minerals

> ② Has rhizoids instead of roots

>> ○ Rhizoids lack tissue differentiation, thus cannot perform the primary role of water and mineral absorption

>> ○ Rhizoids only serve the purpose of support

 ⑵ Possesses rosette-shaped cellulose synthesis enzyme

> ① Rosette-shaped cellulose synthesis enzyme is a trait shared only by charophyta and land plants.
