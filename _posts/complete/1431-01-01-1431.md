## **1. Type 1.** Identifying gene function

⑴ Perturb-seq

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Treat Cas9-expressing cells with various types of gRNA libraries.

>> ○ By using CRISPR-Cas9, various perturbations occur in each cell depending on the type of gRNA.

>> ○ At least 2.5 million cells should remain after filtering.

>> ○ There should be at least 100 cells per perturbation on average.

>> ○ Each cell should have approximately 10,000 UMIs

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Use sequencing technologies that detect both gRNA and mRNA (e.g., scRNA-seq, [MERFISH](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.30.569494v1.full))

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Grouping cells based on gRNA expression: Cells are naturally grouped according to perturbation conditions.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Identify gene function.

>> ○ Premise: Genes with similar functions are likely to exhibit similar expression patterns.

>> ○ **Discoverable Result 1.** Changes in gene expression due to perturbations.

>> ○ **Discoverable Result 2.** Differences in perturbation effects due to genetic variants.

## **2. Type 2.** Identifying transcription regulation

⑴ BS-seq (bisulfite sequencing)

> ① Treat with bisulfite to determine methylation patterns.

> ③ **Application 1.** snmC-seq 

>> ○ Plate-base sequencing.

>> ○ Measures sum of 5-methyl- and 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosines.

>> ○ 1-2 million reads per cell.

⑵ **ChIP-seq** (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing)

> ① **Definition:** Enables analysis of DNA regions bound to specific proteins, such as transcription factors.

> ② Combines DNA sequencing with ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) to identify binding sites of DNA-associated proteins.

> ③ 1<sup>st</sup>. Treat with a cross-linking agent (e.g., formaldehyde) to fix proteins (e.g., transcription factors) and DNA.

> ④ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Lyse the cells, leaving only the DNA/protein complexes.

> ⑤ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Use sonication to break DNA into small fragments (200-350 bp); cross-linked DNA remains intact.

> ⑥ 4<sup>th</sup>. Add antibodies attached to magnetic beads; applying a magnetic field allows isolation of specific proteins and their linked DNA.

> ⑦ 5<sup>th</sup>. Reverse cross-linking: Apply heat to the precipitate to separate DNA from proteins.

> ⑧ 6<sup>th</sup>. Perform sequencing to determine the DNA sequence. Proceeds with PCR amplification, fragment size selection, adaptor addition.

> ⑨ 7<sup>th</sup>. Compare the sequencing results to the genome reference to identify binding sites of transcription factors, etc.

⑹ ATAC-seq (Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing)

> ① Overview

>> ○ Definition: A sequencing technique that identifies euchromatin regions.

>> ○ Pseudo-expression: Euchromatin regions can be inferred as areas of gene expression.

>> ○ Tn5 transposase is an enzyme that cuts open regions of DNA, generating various fragments such as single nucleosomes, dimers, trimers, and more.

>> ○ The Tn5 transposase catalyzes DNA insertion by creating sticky ends.

>> ○ It can directly merge adaptors, allowing immediate sequencing.

>> ○ The ~10.5 bp periodicity observed in ATAC-seq is related to the fact that one full turn of the DNA helix requires 10 bp.

>>> ○ The fourth alpha-helix in Tn5 acts as the major “recognition helix” and makes several base pair-specific contacts in the major groove of the DNA from positions 7 to 13. ([ref](https://biology.kenyon.edu/BMB/Jmol2007/Tn5_Transposase/index.htm))

>>> ○ Tn5 transposase bends the helical axis, leading to an increase in the roll and tilt angles, and in deviations of the major and minor groove widths and depths, compared with average B-DNA. ([ref](https://raymentlab.biochem.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1624/2022/08/117rayment2000_davies.pdf))

>>> ○ This may explain the 10.5 bp periodicity, which is a little different from 10 bp periodicity in average B-DNA.
