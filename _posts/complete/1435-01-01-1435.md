## **1. Regeneration and Transplantation of Hydra**

⑴ Hydra is a diploblastic animal.

⑵ When the head and foot are removed, the head is formed from the upper body region, and the foot is formed from the lower body region.

> ① Regeneration in Hydra has polarity.

> ② Head activator is secreted from the tip of the head (hypostome), forming a concentration gradient from head to foot, and foot activator is secreted from the tip of the foot (basal disc), forming a concentration gradient from foot to head.

⑶ In determining head formation by grafts, not only the graft itself but also the characteristics of the grafted site are important.

> ① Tissue from the body region forms a head when grafted to a more basal body region.

> ② Tissue from the body region does not form a head when grafted to a more apical body region.

> ○ This is due to the head inhibitor secreted from the tip of the head (hypostome).
