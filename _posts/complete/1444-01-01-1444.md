## **1\. Reaction Vessels**

⑴ Distillation Apparatus (aspirator)

> ① Vacuum Filtration Apparatus

⑵ Büchner Funnel 

> ① Equipped with a pump in the funnel itself for vacuum filtration.

⑶ Claisen Adapter

⑷ **Dean-Stark Trap**

> ① Efficiently removes water or low-boiling components formed during reactions

> ② **Condition 1:** Uses an azeotropic mixture: solvent and co-solvent are mixed to maintain a constant boiling point.

> ③ **Condition 2:** Boiling point of azeotropic mixture should be higher than that of the low-boiling solvent

> ④ Examples of solvents used in Dean-Stark Trap: Benzene (80.1 ℃), Toluene (110.6 ℃), Xylene (139.3 ℃)

⑹ Fractional Distillation

> ① Separates compounds with different boiling points

> ② Fractional Distillation Column: Column with many indentations.

> ③ The grooves in the fractional distillation column increase the surface area, allowing vapor-phase compounds to lose heat more easily, thereby enhancing the fractional sensitivity.

⑺ Reflux Condenser

> ① Prevents solvent evaporation

> ② It is designed to ensure that vapor-phase compounds lose as much heat as possible from the cooling water. In other words, the column is coiled.

⑻ Rotary Evaporator

> ① Vacuum + gentle heating + rotation (to increase evaporating surface area)

⑼ Separatory Funnel

> ① Used for separating polar and non-polar liquids

## **4\. Experimental Techniques**

⑴ Recrystallization: Utilizes solubility differences

> ① **Step 1:** Heat the solution until it melts, then slowly cool

>> ○ Slow cooling prevents supercooling

> ② **Step 2:** Wait for crystals to form

>> ○ Providing seed crystals: If no crystals form, scrape the walls of the beaker with a glass rod

> ③ **Step 3:** Filtration using vacuum filtration apparatus (e.g., Büchner funnel)

> ④ **Case 1:** Precipitate is washed with EtOH, dried, and weighed: If interested in the precipitate

>> ○ Reason for evenly dispersing a small amount of solvent over the crystal: to remove impurities from the crystal surface.

> ⑤ **Case 2:** Solvent extraction using a vacuum rotary evaporator: If interested in the solution

> ⑥ Good solvents exhibit significant changes in solubility with temperature

⑵ Phase separation: exploits differences in polarity.

> ① A separatory funnel is generally used.

> ② Adding NaCl increases the ionic strength of the aqueous layer, which promotes clear phase separation between the organic and aqueous layers during extraction.

⑶ Fractional Distillation: Utilizes boiling point differences

**Figure 2.** TLC Chromatography (left) and Column Chromatography (right)

<br>

> ① **Type 1:** Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC): Used to monitor the progress of reactions

>> ○ Principle: Interaction difference between the sample and silica gel

>> ○ Purpose: Confirm reaction progress, determine reaction completion

>> ○ Normal Phase Silica Gel: Strongly polar. Higher affinity  between sample and gel with increasing sample polarity

>> ○ Stationary Phase is silica gel (most polar), Mobile Phase is developing solvent (non-polar)

>> ○ Definition of R<sub>f</sub>: Distance moved by sample ÷ Distance moved by solvent

>> ○ Comparison of R<sub>f</sub> for different compounds

>>> ○ Acid, Base, Metal salt ＜ Carboxylic acid, Amine, Amide ＜ Alcohol ＜ Aldehyde, Ketone ＜ Alkyl halide ＜ Ester ＜ Alkene ＜ Alkyne ＜ Alkane

>>> ○ **Trend 1:** Higher sample polarity leads to stronger interaction with silica gel, resulting in smaller Rf

>>> ○ **Trend 2:** Amino and hydroxy groups are less polar than nitro, but due to hydrogen bonding, their R<sub>f</sub> is smaller

>>> ○ **Trend 3:** _trans_ Alkenes have smaller R<sub>f</sub> than _cis_ Alkenes (because of stronger interaction)

>>> ○ Example: R<sub>f</sub> in Paper Chromatography and Chlorophyll Separation Experiment: Carotinoids > Xanthophyll > Chlorophyll a > Chlorophyll b

>> ○ Comparison of R<sub>f</sub> with organic solvents

>>> ○ Water ＜ Acetic acid ＜ Alcohol ＜ Ethyl Acetate ＜ CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> ＜ Toluene ＜ CCl<sub>4</sub> ＜ n-Hexane

>>> ○ **Trend 1:** Higher polarity of the developing solvent leads to increased R<sub>f</sub> as it moves along with sample.

>>> ○ Ethyl Acetate: Representative polar solvent

>>> ○ _n_-Hexane: Representative non-polar solvent

② **Type 2:** Column Chromatography: Used for separation of mixtures

>> ○ TLC can be thought of as a simplified chromatography

>> ○ **Factor 1:** Faster migration with weaker interactions in the column: Columns are generally polar

>> ○ **Factor 2:** Faster migration with stronger interactions with the developing solvent: Developing solvent is non-polar

>> ○ Non-polar substances migrate faster. Gravity has little relevance

⑸ Qualitative Analysis: Uses visible characteristics for identification of specific functional groups in organic compounds

> ① Br<sub>2</sub>: Reddish-brown solution

>> ○ Bleaching Reaction: Halogenation reaction results in colorless product

> ② FeCl<sub>3</sub>(_aq_): Yellow solution

>> ○ Reacts with phenol to form Fe(OPh)<sub>3</sub>, producing color change (burgundy)

>> ○ Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>: Green rust

>> ○ Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>: Dark orange

> ③ AgNO<sub>3</sub>(_aq_): Colorless solution

>> ○ Forms white precipitate AgCl if leaving group is Cl<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ Forms yellow precipitate AgI if leaving group is I<sup>-</sup>

> ④ KMnO<sub>4</sub>(_aq_): Purple solution

>> ○ Forms brown precipitate MnO<sub>2</sub>

> ⑤ AgNO<sub>3</sub>, KOH, NH<sub>4</sub>OH or Ag<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>4</sub>OH: Colorless solution

>> ○ Silver mirror reaction or Tollens test: It does not react with ketones but reacts with aldehydes to precipitate metallic silver.

>> ○ Ag<sub>2</sub>O acts as an Ag<sup>+</sup> donor: Oxygen in water migrates to aldehydes, forming carboxylic acids.

<br>

> ⑥ Concentrated HCl, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>: Colorless solution

>> ○ Reacts with alcohols to form alkyl chlorides, resulting in a cloudy solution or layer separation

>> ○ In the S<sub>N</sub>1 addition reaction of alcohols, chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) is relatively unreactive among X<sup>-</sup>, so a catalyst such as ZnCl<sub>2</sub> is required.

> ⑦ Silver (Ag)

>> ○ Reacts with hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) to form black silver sulfide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S) precipitate

> ⑧ Chromium (Cr)

>> ○ K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is orange, Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> is bluish-green

>> ○ K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is used as an oxidizing agent, often used to measure COD

> ⑨ Ammonium Chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl)

>> ○ Reaction of gaseous HCl and NH<sub>3</sub> results in a white ring

⑹ Primary purification: separating organic materials

> ① Remove inorganic salts, leaving only organic compounds.

> ② After extraction, obtain the crude product (primary purified material) by drying, filtration, and vacuum (reduced-pressure) distillation.

> ③ Primary purification workflow:

>> ○ Extraction → washing (optional) → drying → filtration → concentration (or evaporation)

>> ○ Goals: remove inorganic salts; remove water from the organic phase; evaporate the organic solvent.

> ④ Extraction → washing details:

>> ○ For the final wash, use saturated brine.

>>> ○ <b>Purpose 1:</b> promote transfer of anions into the aqueous layer.

>>> ○ <b>Purpose 2:</b> remove as much water as possible from the organic solvent.

>> ○ For the final wash, an acid or base may be used.

>>> ○ Additional salt removal purpose: wash salts with acid, or wash residual acids with base.

⑺ Optical resolution

> ① Convert a racemic mixture into diastereomeric derivatives by reacting with an enantiomer of known absolute configuration.

> ② Because their physico-chemical properties differ, the diastereomers can be separated.

> ③ <b>Application 1.</b> acid–base approach: add a strong acid or base to form ionic pairs between the substrate and the resolving agent, enabling separation.

> ④ <b>Application 2.</b> chiral (enantioselective) chromatography.
