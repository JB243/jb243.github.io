## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ Pattern Formation: The process by which spatial components of the embryo are determined

 ⑵ **Pattern Formation 1.** Maternal Effect Genes: Also called egg polarity genes

 ⑶ **Pattern Formation 2.** Segmentation Genes

 ⑷ **Pattern Formation 3.** Homeotic Genes

**Figure 1.** Anterior–Posterior Axis Determination Process

<br>

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. As fertilization occurs, protein translation and diffusion → regulation of gap mRNA expression.

⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The oocyte moves to the posterior, and the anterior is occupied by nurse cells.

⑶ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The nucleus of the posteriorly positioned oocyte synthesizes Gurken protein from gurken mRNA.

⑷ 4<sup>th</sup>. Concurrently with ⑵, terminal follicle cells express Torpedo.

⑸ 5<sup>th</sup>. When Gurken binds Torpedo, it activates protein kinase A, determining microtubule orientation.

⑹ 6<sup>th</sup>. bicoid mRNA (= bcd mRNA) binds dynein and moves toward the anterior.

⑺ 7<sup>th</sup>. After oskar mRNA is translated, it associates with nanos mRNA (= nos mRNA).

⑻ 8<sup>th</sup>. Oskar protein holding nanos mRNA binds kinesin and moves posteriorly → nanos mRNA accumulates at the posterior.

⑼ 9<sup>th</sup>. Anterior–posterior axis expression.

**Figure 2.** Distribution of Anterior–Posterior Morphogens

<br>

> ① _hunchback_ mRNA and _caudal_ mRNA are evenly distributed throughout the embryo

> ② Bicoid distributed in the anterior inhibits translation of _caudal_ mRNA and relatively promotes translation of _hunchback_ mRNA

> ③ Nanos distributed in the posterior inhibits translation of _hunchback_ mRNA and relatively promotes translation of _caudal_ mRNA

>> ○ Nanos protein reduces the poly A tail length of hunchback mRNA → mRNA lifespan↓ → translation inhibition

>> ○ Injecting bicoid mRNA into the posterior results in head and thorax formation in the posterior

> ④ _hunchback_ mRNA: Forms the tip of the head, head, and thorax

> ⑤ _caudal_ mRNA: Forms the abdomen and tail

>> ○ Note: staufen

 ⑽ 10<sup>th</sup>. Nucleus with gurken protein moves along microtubules and induces surrounding follicle cells into dorsal oocyte cells

## **3. Maternal Effect Genes: Dorsal–Ventral Axis Determination**

<br>

**Figure 3.** Dorsal–Ventral Axis Determination Process

<br>

 ⑴ Premise

> ① Dorsal protein accumulates in the nuclei on the ventral side of the embryo, and its concentration gradually decreases from ventral to dorsal

> ② Dorsal protein binds to the enhancers of _snail_ and _rhomboid_ to induce their expression

> ③ Snail protein inhibits the expression of rhomboid

 ⑵ Result

> ① Areas with high dorsal protein expression express only _snail_

> ② Areas with low dorsal protein expression mainly express _rhomboid_

>> ○ Note: Dorsal protein has higher affinity for the enhancer of _rhomboid_ than for that of _snail_

<br>

<br>

## **4. Segmentation Genes**

 ⑴ Gap Genes: Divide the embryo into anterior, middle, and posterior parts and induce the action of subsequent genes

 ⑵ Pair-Rule Genes: Although not visible morphologically, they divide the embryo into periodic units called parasegments

 ⑶ Segment Polarity Genes: Establish anterior–posterior within each segment to complete segment formation

<br>

<br>

## 5. [Homeotic Genes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1453)

⑴ Homeotic genes

> ① Master regulatory genes that control other genes involved in forming body structure

> ② Involved in segment-specific differentiation

> ③ *Drosophila* has a single cluster.

⑵ Homeobox (HOX)

> ① A DNA region where transcription factors bind

> ② Evolutionarily highly conserved.

⑶ Example: Homeotic genes expressed in the thorax of a *Drosophila* embryo

**Figure 4.** Homeotic genes of Drosophila embryo

<br>

> ① In the embryo, the genes *Scr*, *Antp*, and *Ubx* are expressed in thoracic segments T1, T2, and T3, respectively.

> ② Legs form in all of T1, T2, and T3.

> ③ In the adult, wings and halteres form in T2 and T3, respectively.

> ④ If *Antp* is expressed in the embryo’s head, legs form on the adult head instead of antennae.

> ⑤ In *Drosophila* lacking *Ubx* function, wings form in T3 instead of halteres.
