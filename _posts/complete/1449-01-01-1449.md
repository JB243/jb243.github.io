## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ Pattern Formation: The process by which spatial components of the embryo are determined

 ⑵ **Pattern Formation 1.** Maternal Effect Genes: Also called egg polarity genes

 ⑶ **Pattern Formation 2.** Segmentation Genes

 ⑷ **Pattern Formation 3.** Homeotic Genes

**Figure 1.** Anterior–Posterior Axis Determination Process

<br>

 ⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Upon fertilization, protein translation and diffusion occur → Regulates expression of _gap_ mRNA

 ⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The oocyte moves to the posterior, and nurse cells occupy the anterior

 ⑶ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The nucleus that moved to the posterior synthesizes Gurken protein from _gurken_ mRNA

 ⑷ 4<sup>th</sup>. Simultaneously with ⑵, terminal follicle cells express torpedo

 ⑸ 5<sup>th</sup>. When gurken binds to torpedo, protein kinase A is activated, determining the orientation of microtubules

 ⑹ 6<sup>th</sup>. _bicoid_ mRNA (= _bcd_ mRNA) binds to dynein and moves to the anterior

 ⑺ 7<sup>th</sup>. _oskar_ mRNA binds to _nanos_ mRNA (= _nos_ mRNA) after translation

 ⑻ 8<sup>th</sup>. Oskar protein that holds _nanos_ mRNA binds to kinesin and moves posteriorly → _nanos_ mRNA accumulates in the posterior

 ⑼ 9<sup>th</sup>. Anterior–Posterior Axis Expression

**Figure 2.** Distribution of Anterior–Posterior Morphogens

<br>

> ① _hunchback_ mRNA and _caudal_ mRNA are evenly distributed throughout the embryo

> ② Bicoid distributed in the anterior inhibits translation of _caudal_ mRNA and relatively promotes translation of _hunchback_ mRNA

> ③ Nanos distributed in the posterior inhibits translation of _hunchback_ mRNA and relatively promotes translation of _caudal_ mRNA

>> ○ Nanos protein reduces the poly A tail length of hunchback mRNA → lifespan↓ → translation inhibition

>> ○ Injecting bicoid mRNA into the posterior results in head and thorax formation in the posterior

> ④ _hunchback_ mRNA: Forms the tip of the head, head, and thorax

> ⑤ _caudal_ mRNA: Forms the abdomen and tail

>> ○ Note: staufen

 ⑽ 10<sup>th</sup>. Nucleus with gurken protein moves along microtubules and induces surrounding follicle cells into dorsal oocyte cells

## **3. Maternal Effect Genes: Dorsal–Ventral Axis Determination**

<br>

**Figure 3.** Dorsal–Ventral Axis Determination Process

<br>

 ⑴ Premise

> ① Dorsal protein accumulates in the nuclei on the ventral side of the embryo, and its concentration gradually decreases from ventral to dorsal

> ② Dorsal protein binds to the enhancers of _snail_ and _rhomboid_ to induce their expression

> ③ Snail protein inhibits the expression of rhomboid

 ⑵ Result

> ① Areas with high dorsal protein expression express only _snail_

> ② Areas with low dorsal protein expression mainly express _rhomboid_

>> ○ Note: Dorsal protein has higher affinity for the enhancer of _rhomboid_ than for that of _snail_

<br>

<br>

## **4. Segmentation Genes**

 ⑴ Gap Genes: Divide the embryo into anterior, middle, and posterior parts and induce the action of subsequent genes

 ⑵ Pair-Rule Genes: Although not visible morphologically, they divide the embryo into periodic units called parasegments

 ⑶ Segment Polarity Genes: Establish anterior–posterior within each segment to complete segment formation

<br>

<br>

## **5. [Homeotic Genes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1453)

 ⑴ Master regulatory genes that control other genes involved in forming the body plan

 ⑵ Homeobox (HOX, homeo box)

> ① Region where transcription factors bind

> ② Evolutionarily well conserved
