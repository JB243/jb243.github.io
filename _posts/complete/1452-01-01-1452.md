## **1. (Cleavage stage) Axis determination **

 ⑴ Anterior-posterior axis formation by shh (sonic hedgehog homolog)

 ⑵ Low shh concentration: Anterior formation

 ⑶ High shh concentration: Posterior formation

<br>

<br>

## **2. (Gastrulation stage) Organizer 1. Hensen's node**

 ⑴ Ingression site: Primitive streak, formed along the embryo's anterior-posterior axis

 ⑵ Hensen's node

> ① Cells ingressed at Hensen's node become notochordal mesoderm

> ② Evolutionarily conserved: Transplanting the dorsal lip of the amphibian blastopore (Spemann organizer) still results in normal development

<br>

<br>

## **3. (Gastrulation stage) Germ layer formation**

 ⑴ High yolk content in the center makes cell movement difficult → Different pattern of germ layer formation

 ⑵ Epiblast: Forms ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm

 ⑶ Hypoblast: Assists germ layer formation

<br>

<br>

## **4. (Organogenesis) Organizer 2. Limb bud **

 ⑴ Limb bud

**Figure 1.** Wing bud of a chick embryo on day 3 of development

<br>

> ① Composed of two organizers: Apical ectodermal ridge (AER), zone of polarizing activity (ZPA)

> ② Depending on the region of action, it is divided into leg bud (forearm) and wing bud (wing)

 ⑵ Limb buds develop from proximal → distal direction

> ① The proximal region of the leg/wing bud is destined to become forearm bone/wing bone, while the distal region is destined to become finger bones

> ② Experiment of transplanting the proximal region of the leg bud into the distal region of the wing bud

>> ○ Transplantation before leg/wing fate is determined: Wing fingers form

>> ○ Transplantation after leg/wing fate is determined but before proximal-distal axis positional information is set: Leg fingers form

>> ○ Transplantation after both leg/wing fate and positional information are determined: Forearm bone forms

 ⑶ **Organizer 2-1.** Apical ectodermal ridge (AER): Secretes growth factors

> ① Substitution with FGF8 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 8) shows little difference in development

 ⑷ **Organizer 2-2.** Zone of polarizing activity (ZPA): Secretes shh

> ① Low shh concentration → Anterior formation → Related to the 4th digit

> ② High shh concentration → Posterior formation → Related to the 1st digit

> ③ shh can antagonize BMP and induce motor neurons

<br>

<br>

## **5. (Organogenesis) Neural tube development**

 ⑴ shh protein secreted from the notochord determines the ventral-dorsal axis of the neural tube

 ⑵ Depending on the shh concentration gradient, different types of neurons differentiate in the neural tube

> ① From closest to the notochord: floor plate, motor neurons, V2 interneurons, V1 interneurons

> ② Additional notochord transplanted into the neural plate induces extra floor plate and motor neurons

 ⑶ Anti-shh antibodies inhibit the function of shh
