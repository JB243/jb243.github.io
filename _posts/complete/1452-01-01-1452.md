## 1. (Cleavage stage) Axis determination

 ⑴ Anterior-posterior axis formation by shh (sonic hedgehog homolog)

 ⑵ Low shh concentration: Anterior formation

 ⑶ High shh concentration: Posterior formation 

<br>

<br>

## **2. (Gastrulation stage) Organizer 1. Hensen's node**

⑴ Ingression site: the primitive streak, which forms along the embryo's anterior–posterior axis.

⑵ Hensen's node

> ① Cells that ingress through Hensen's node become the notochordal mesoderm.

> ② Evolutionarily conserved: transplantation of the amphibian organizer—the dorsal lip of the blastopore—still results in normal development.

<br>

<br>

## **3. (Gastrulation stage) Germ layer formation**

 ⑴ High yolk content in the center makes cell movement difficult → Different pattern of germ layer formation

 ⑵ Epiblast: Forms ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm

 ⑶ Hypoblast: Assists germ layer formation

## **4. (Organogenesis) Organizer 2. Limb bud **

 ⑴ Limb bud

**Figure 1.** Wing bud of a chick embryo on day 3 of development

<br>

> ① Composed of two organizers: Apical ectodermal ridge (AER), zone of polarizing activity (ZPA)

> ② Depending on the region of action, it is divided into leg bud (forearm) and wing bud (wing)

⑵ Limb buds develop in a proximal → distal sequence.

> ① In the leg (hindlimb) bud / wing (forelimb) bud, the basal (proximal) region is prespecified for the zeugopod (forearm in the forelimb; shank in the hindlimb), while the distal region is prespecified for the digits (phalanges).

> ② Experiment: graft a basal piece of the leg bud onto the distal region of the wing bud.

>> ○ If grafted before leg/wing identity is determined: wing digits form.

>> ○ If grafted after leg/wing identity is determined but before proximal–distal positional information is set: leg digits form.

>> ○ If grafted after both leg/wing identity and proximal–distal positional information are set: a forearm bone forms.

⑶ **Organizer 2-1.** Apical ectodermal ridge (AER): secretes growth factors.

> ① Development shows little difference even when AER is replaced with fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8).

⑷ **Organizer 2-2.** Zone of polarizing activity (ZPA): secretes Shh.

> ① Lower Shh → anterior structures form → associated with the 4th digit.

> ② Higher Shh → posterior structures form → associated with the 1st digit.

> ③ Shh antagonizes BMP and can induce motor neurons.

<br>

<br>

## **5. (Organogenesis) Neural tube development**

 ⑴ shh protein secreted from the notochord determines the ventral-dorsal axis of the neural tube

 ⑵ Depending on the shh concentration gradient, different types of neurons differentiate in the neural tube

> ① From closest to the notochord: floor plate, motor neurons, V2 interneurons, V1 interneurons

> ② Additional notochord transplanted into the neural plate of the embryo induces extra floor plate and motor neurons

 ⑶ Anti-shh antibodies inhibit the function of shh
