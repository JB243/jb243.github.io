## **1. Fertilization**

 ⑴ [Mammalian Fertilization Process](https://jb243.github.io/pages/553)

<br>

<br>

## **2. Cleavage**

 ⑴ Characteristics of Mammalian Cleavage

> ① Equal Cleavage

> ② Rotational Cleavage

> ③ Asynchrony in Early Division

> ④ Compaction

> ⑤ Mammalian cleavage is the slowest among animals

 ⑵ 2-cell stage: 30 hours after fertilization

 ⑶ 4-cell stage: 60 hours after fertilization

 ⑷ 8-cell stage: Formation of tight junctions between cells (compaction)

 ⑸ Morula: Reaches uterus between day 3 to 6 and forms a blastocyst (32 cells)

 ⑹ In early mammalian embryos, each blastomere is totipotent up to the 8-cell stage

> ① Totipotency (organism-forming capacity): the ability of a single cell to form not only the embryo and the adult organism but, in species that possess them, also the extraembryonic membranes.

<br>

<br>

## **3. Implantation**

 ⑴ Implantation occurs only at the blastocyst stage

 ⑵ Blastocyst = Trophoblast + Inner Cell Mass (ICM) + Blastocoel

⑶ Trophoblast cell layer (trophectoderm)

> ① Initiates implantation; after implantation, forms the chorion and chorionic villi.

> ② Secretes enzymes that degrade the uterine wall.

⑷ The trophoblast cell layer becomes the placenta via the chorion.

<br>

<br>

## **4. Extraembryonic Membrane Formation**

⑴ Formation of extraembryonic membranes after germ layer formation

⑵ During the blastocyst stage, the inner cell mass not only forms the entire embryo but also gives rise to the extraembryonic membranes (allantois, yolk sac, amnion).

⑶ Types of extraembryonic membranes

> ① Chorion: the membrane that encloses the entire embryo; ectoderm + mesoderm

>> ○ Called the serosa in birds.

>> ○ Involved in uterine implantation.

>> ○ Secretes hCG to prevent degeneration of the corpus luteum.

>> ○ Because the corpus luteum is maintained only up to about 3 months, hCG is secreted only until then; thereafter, the placenta takes over this role.

> ② Amnion: the membrane surrounding the embryo and enclosing the amniotic fluid; ectoderm + mesoderm

>> ○ The amnion is derived from the inner cell mass.

>> ○ Protects the embryo.

> ③ Allantois: waste storage; mesoderm + endoderm

>> ○ In mammals, associated with formation of the umbilical cord.

> ④ Yolk sac: provides nutrients to the embryo; mesoderm + endoderm

>> ○ Hematopoietic function.

>> ○ In mammals, it is unnecessary for nutrition because nutrients are supplied via the umbilical cord.

⑷ Monozygotic twins: classified according to the timing of chorion and amnion formation.

> ① The amnion is formed later than the chorion.

> ② Separation before implantation (before ~day 5 post-fertilization): two chorions and two amnions.

> ③ Separation on days 5–10 post-fertilization: two amnions within a single chorion.

> ④ Separation on days 10–14 post-fertilization: one chorion and one amnion; rare (about 4–6%); conjoined twins fall into this category.

## **5. Germ Layer Formation**

 ⑴ Organizer

> ① Organizer in mammals: Hensen's node

> ② Not an organizer in mammals: Dorsal lip of the blastopore

 ⑵ Neurulation

> ① During neurulation, the embryonic trunk mesoderm is subdivided into four parts (notochordal, paraxial, intermediate, lateral plate mesoderm)

> ② Paraxial mesoderm: Forms somites → which become bones and muscles

>> ○ _MyoD_ gene is expressed in somite cells that will form skeletal muscle

<br>

<br>

## **6. Homeo Genes**

 ⑴ Terminology

> ① Homeo gene: Master gene that regulates other genes involved in body structure formation

>> ○ Example: antennapedia gene, bithorax gene

> ② Homeobox (HOX)

>> ○ A ~180 base pair sequence found within all homeo genes

>> ○ Highly conserved evolutionarily

>> ○ Contains each gene’s ORF and transcription factor binding site

> ③ Homeodomain

>> ○ 60 base pair sequence encoded by the homeobox

>> ○ Encodes helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, transcription factor binding site

 ⑵ Homeo Genes in Drosophila: Drosophila has a single cluster

 ⑶ Vertebrate Homeobox

> ① All vertebrates have the same mechanism for vertebral development

> ② Vertebrates have 4 clusters on different chromosomes

>> ○ Mammals have 4 sets of HOX complexes per genome

>> ○ Homeobox genes are numbered 1 to 13 according to expression order from the anterior end of each cluster

>> ○ In each complex, the HOX gene closest to the 3' end is expressed first, and its expression occurs in the anterior region of the embryo.

> ③ HOX genes with higher numbers are expressed 

<br>

<br>

## **7. Fetus**

 ⑴ In humans,

> ① Embryo: Up to 8 weeks after fertilization

> ② Fetus: Week 9 to birth
