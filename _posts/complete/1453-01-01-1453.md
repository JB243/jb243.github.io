## **1. Fertilization**

 ⑴ [Mammalian Fertilization Process](https://jb243.github.io/pages/553)

<br>

<br>

## **2. Cleavage**

 ⑴ Characteristics of Mammalian Cleavage

> ① Equal Cleavage

> ② Rotational Cleavage

> ③ Asynchrony in Early Division

> ④ Compaction

> ⑤ Mammalian cleavage is the slowest among animals

 ⑵ 2-cell stage: 30 hours after fertilization

 ⑶ 4-cell stage: 60 hours after fertilization

 ⑷ 8-cell stage: Formation of tight junctions between cells (compaction)

 ⑸ Morula: Reaches uterus between day 3 to 6 and forms a blastocyst (32 cells)

 ⑹ In early mammalian embryos, each blastomere is totipotent up to the 8-cell stage

> ① Totipotency: The ability of a single cell to develop into the entire organism including extraembryonic tissues (in species that form them)

<br>

<br>

## **3. Implantation**

 ⑴ Implantation occurs only at the blastocyst stage

 ⑵ Blastocyst = Trophoblast + Inner Cell Mass (ICM) + Blastocoel

 ⑶ Trophoblast

> ① Initiates implantation and later forms chorion and villi

> ② Secretes enzymes to break down uterine wall

 ⑷ Trophoblast becomes placenta through chorion

<br>

<br>

## **4. Extraembryonic Membrane Formation**

⑴ Formation after germ layers are established

 ⑵ Inner cell mass of the blastocyst forms not only the embryo but also extraembryonic membranes (allantois, yolk sac, amnion)

 ⑶ Types of Extraembryonic Membranes

> ① Chorion: Membrane that surrounds the entire embryo, made of ectoderm + mesoderm

>> ○ Called serosa in birds

>> ○ Involved in uterine implantation

>> ○ Secretes hCG to prevent degeneration of corpus luteum

>> ○ Since the corpus luteum lasts only until 3 months, hCG is secreted only until then: Placenta takes over hCG's role afterward

> ② Amnion: Amniotic fluid, membrane that surrounds the embryo, ectoderm + mesoderm

>> ○ Derived from inner cell mass

>> ○ Protects the embryo

> ③ Allantois: Stores waste, mesoderm + endoderm

>> ○ Related to umbilical cord formation in mammals

> ④ Yolk Sac: Provides nutrients to the embryo, mesoderm + endoderm

>> ○ Has hematopoietic function

>> ○ Unnecessary in mammals since nutrients are provided via the umbilical cord

 ⑷ Identical Twins: Classified by the timing of chorion and amnion formation

> ① Amnion forms later than chorion

> ② Separation before implantation (before day 5 post-fertilization): 2 chorions and 2 amnions

> ③ Separation between day 5–10 post-fertilization: 2 amnions within 1 chorion

> ④ Separation between day 10–14 post-fertilization: 1 chorion and 1 amnion, rare (4–6%), includes conjoined twins

## **5. Germ Layer Formation**

 ⑴ Organizer

> ① Organizer in mammals: Hensen's node

> ② Not an organizer in mammals: Dorsal lip of the blastopore

 ⑵ Neurulation

> ① During neurulation, the embryonic trunk mesoderm is subdivided into four parts (notochordal, paraxial, intermediate, lateral plate mesoderm)

> ② Paraxial mesoderm: Forms somites → which become bones and muscles

>> ○ _MyoD_ gene is expressed in somite cells that will form skeletal muscle

<br>

<br>

## **6. Homeo Genes**

 ⑴ Terminology

> ① Homeo gene: Master gene that regulates other genes involved in body structure

>> ○ Example: antennapedia gene, bithorax gene

> ② Homeobox (HOX)

>> ○ A ~180 base pair sequence found within all homeo genes

>> ○ Highly conserved evolutionarily

>> ○ Contains each gene’s ORF and transcription factor binding site

> ③ Homeodomain

>> ○ 60 base pair sequence encoded by the homeobox

>> ○ Encodes helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, transcription factor binding site

 ⑵ Homeo Genes in Drosophila: Drosophila has a single cluster

 ⑶ Vertebrate Homeobox

> ① All vertebrates have the same mechanism for vertebral development

> ② Vertebrates have 4 clusters on different chromosomes

>> ○ Mammals have 4 sets of HOX complexes per genome

>> ○ Homeobox genes are numbered 1 to 13 according to expression order from the anterior end of each cluster

>> ○ HOX gene nearest to the 3' end is expressed first, from the anterior part of the embryo

> ③ HOX genes with higher numbers are expressed later

<br>

<br>

## **7. Fetus**

 ⑴ In humans,

> ① Embryo: Up to 8 weeks after fertilization

> ② Fetus: Week 9 to birth
