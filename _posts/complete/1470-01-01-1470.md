## **1\. Characteristics**

 ⑴ Multicellular and Nonmotile Eukaryotic Organisms

> ① Exception: Yeast

> ② Multinucleate fungi → Septa → Multicellular filament

 ⑵ Lack Chlorophyll, Depend on Heterotrophic Nutrition

> ① Extracellular Digestion: Absorption through Hyphae

> ② **Symbiosis 1.** Ascomycetes: Symbiosis with Lichen (Plants), Cyanobacteria (Bacteria), and Green Algae (Protists)

> ③ **Symbiosis 2.** Mycorrhizae: Fungi + Plants (Eukaryotic)

 ⑶ Composed of Mycelium: Body, Reproductive Structures

> ① Hypha: Structure formed by elongated cells resembling threads

> ② A group of hyphae forms a mycelium

 ⑷ Cell Organelles

> ① Cell Organelles are enclosed by the Cell Membrane

> ② Cell Membrane: Composed of Ergosterol

> ③ Cell Wall: Composed of Chitin, Glucan

 ⑸ Classification Based on Presence of Septa

> ① Septa: Walls between cells, containing pores large enough for nuclei to pass through

> ② Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota: No Septa

> ③ Ascomycota: Partial Septa

> ④ Basidiomycota: Septa Present

## **2\. Life Cycle**

 ⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Hyphae or Mycelium (n)

 ⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. (+) Mating Type (n) and (-) Mating Type (n) Fuse to Form Diploid Nucleus (2n)

 ⑶ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Spore (n) Formation

> ① Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota: Diploid → Fusion → Meiosis

> ② Ascomycota: Diploid → Cell Division → Fusion → Meiosis, 8 Spores / Ascus

> ③ Basidiomycota: Diploid → Cell Division → Fusion → Meiosis, 4 Spores / Basidium

 ⑷ 4<sup>th</sup>. Spore (n) Mitosis → Formation of Plasmodium (n)

## **3\. Classification**

 ⑴ Chytridiomycota (Chytrids)

> ① Earliest Fungi

> ② Zoospores (Animal-like Spores)

 ⑵ Zygomycota (Zygomycetes) (e.g., Mucorales)

> ① No septum

> ② Sexual Reproduction produces Zygosporangium

> ③ Zygospore: a spore (n) formed by meiosis of a zygote (2n)

 ⑶ Mycorrhizae

> ① Symbiosis with Plants

> ② Ectomycorrhizae: Observed in 10% of Plants

>> ○ Ectomycorrhizal Hyphae form a tough mantle over the root surface

>> ○ Some Hyphae penetrate the outer cells of the root but do not enter the plant cell walls

> ③ Endomycorrhizae: Observed in 85% of Plants

>> ○ Endomycorrhizal Hyphae grow into the outer cells of the root and do not form a mantle over the root surface.

>> ○ Some hyphae can grow inward by penetrating the plant cell wall, but they do not break through the cell membrane or enter the cytoplasm.

> ④ Mycorrhiza → Plant: Mycorrhiza provides Plants with nutrients like NO3- or H2PO4-

> ⑤ Plant → Mycorrhiza: Plants provide Mycorrhiza with photosynthesis products, such as sugars

 ⑷ Ascomycota (Sac Fungi) (e.g., Yeasts, Aspergillus oryzae, Penicillium (synthesizing penicilin), Neurospora crassa)

> ① During sexual reproduction, the ascus, a fruiting body, develops.

> ② Ascospores: Spores formed within the Ascus (n)

> ③ Conidiospores: Used during Asexual Reproduction, while Ascospores are used during Sexual Reproduction

> ④ When survival conditions are unfavorable, yeast cells undergo conjugation to form ascospore.

> ⑤ Symbiosis with lichen.

 ⑸ Basidiomycota (Club Fungi) (e.g., mushrooms, cordyceps)

> ① Hyphae gather to form a fruiting body, and basidiospores are produced in the basidium located in the fruiting body (the mushroom part).

> ② Basidiospore: a haploid spore (n) formed in the basidium within the fruiting body.

> ③ Survives by decomposing lignin in wood.

> ④ A dikaryotic mycelium divides to form mushrooms and basidia.
