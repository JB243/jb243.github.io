## **1\. Biological Pollution**

 ⑴ Types of Biological Pollution

> ① Biofilm

>> ○ Example: Biofilm formed in water pipes

> ② [Eutrophication](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1521): Phenomenon where algae proliferate due to nutrient enrichment in aquatic environments

>> ○ Specifically, it refers to the significant increase in inorganic nutrient levels in water due to the influx of nitrates and phosphates

>> ○ [Biological Oxygen Demand](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1378)

>> ○ To inhibit cyanobacteria-induced algal blooms, the inflow of the phosphorus substance must be minimized

 ⑵ Indicator Microorganism Detection Methods

> ① Mainly using the coliform bacteria group (Escherichia coli)

> ② **Group 1.** Total Coliform (TC)

>> ○ MPN Method

>> ○ Membrane Filtration Method

>> ○ Enzyme Activity Measurement Method

> ③ **Group 2.** Fecal Coliform (FC)

> ④ Other bacteria can also be used

 ⑶ Other Detection Methods

> ① Adenylate Energy Charge (AEC): Measures the activity of microbial communities

> ② T-RFLP (Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism): Genetic analysis method used to detect pathogenic microorganisms

> ③ Community Composition Analysis: Divided into composition analysis through cell components and composition analysis using rRNA genes

 ⑷ Sterilization: Different from disinfection

> ① Batch High-Pressure Sterilization (Autoclave): 121 ℃, 15 psi, 15 minutes. Under these conditions, most microorganisms are generally killed

> ② Ethylene Oxide Gas Sterilization (EOG)

> ③ Radiation Sterilization

## **2. Useful Environmental Microorganisms **

 ⑴ Detection of Pollution Sources: [Ames Test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1487)

 ⑵ Pollution Removal

> ① Bioremediation

>> ○ Using microorganisms for soil and groundwater pollution

>> ○ When groundwater containing nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), and oxygen (O2) is contaminated with organic substances, microorganisms decompose the pollutants

>> ○ **Method 1.** Bioaugmentation

>> ○ **Method 2.** Biostimulation

>> ○ **Method 3.** In-situ Bioremediation

>> ○ **Method 4.** Ex-situ Bioremediation

> ② Nitrogen Removal Process

>> ○ ANAMMOX (Anaerobic Ammonia Oxidation)

> ③ Benzene Removal Process

>> ○ Benzene Ring Cleavage Reaction

> ④ Phosphorus Removal Process

> ⑤ Wastewater Treatment

>> ○ **Method 1.** Suspended Growth Process of Microogranisms

>> ○ **Method 2.** Attached Growth Process of Microorganisms
