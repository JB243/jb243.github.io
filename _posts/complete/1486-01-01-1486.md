## **2. Experimental Equipment**

 ⑴ Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)

> ① Capable of measuring down to about 1/10–1/100 of an atomic diameter.

> ② Usable in air (operable under ambient conditions).

 ⑵ Elemental Analyzer

> ① Determines the percentage amounts of C, H, N, S, and O.

> ③ In the oxidation reactor, products are oxidized to H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>3</sub>.

> ④ In the reduction reactor, NO and NO<sub>2</sub> are reduced to N<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub> to SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO is re-oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub>.

> ⑤ For oxygen determination, the sample undergoes pyrolysis under oxygen-free conditions, and the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> ultimately produced is measured.

> ⑥ Other generated gases are separated using an adsorption trap.

> ⑦ The final gases are quantified by gas chromatography (GC) with helium as the carrier gas to calculate each content.

 ⑶ Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS)

> ① Utilizes characteristic x-rays

> ② Characteristic X-ray: X-rays are generated when an electron from the K-shell is ejected by ionizing radiation, and an electron from the L-shell moves to the K-shell.

**Figure 1.** The Principle of Characteristic X-rays

<br>

>> ○ K: Electron shell with n = 1.

>> ○ L: Electron shell with n = 2.

>> ○ M: Electron shell with n = 3.

> ③ The term "characteristic" is used to indicate that a common peak is observed regardless of the type of scintillating material.

> ④ These X-rays can be applied to Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).

 ⑷ Gas Chromatography (GC)

> ① Definition: The method in which the evaporated sample components are separated by being distributed between the stationary phase in the column and the mobile gas phase.

> ② Inert gases like helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, argon are commonly used as carrier gases. Helium is mainly used as the gas phase.

>> ○ **Reason 1:** Lighter gas molecules like H<sub>2</sub>, He have higher diffusion coefficients, leading to faster separation

>> ○ **Reason 2:** Lighter gas molecules like H<sub>2</sub>, He have higher thermal conductivity, reducing preheating time

>> ○ **Reason 3:** Gases like H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> can react with the sample

> ③ Advantages: High resolution

> ④ Disadvantages: Analyzing non-volatile compounds is challenging.

>> ○ Suitable for small molecular weights (typically 10<sup>0</sup> - 10<sup>3</sup>.

>> ○ In general, gas chromatography becomes difficult to perform for compounds with molecular weights above 500.

> ⑤ **Application 1:** Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLC) and Gas-Solid Chromatography (GSC)

> ⑥ **Application 2:** Measuring molecular weights through gas chromatography: using correlation between retention time and molecular weight 

> ⑦ **Application 3:** Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrography (GC-MS)

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> Step: Separated substances from gas chromatography are electronically ionized or chemically ionized for mass-dependent classification

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> Step: Separated substances form unique mass spectra

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> Step: Structure information is obtained by comparing with accumulated library data or quantitative analysis

>> ○ Can also be used for quantifying trace components by selecting 1st ions and performing 2nd ionization

 ⑸ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)

> ① Measures presence and molecular weight of trace substances using the difference in movement distance on a stationary phase in chromatography

> ② Molecular weight conditions: 6 × 10<sup>1</sup> ~ 10<sup>4</sup>

> ③ Comprises solvent, pump, injector, column, detector, recorder

> ④ Most common detector in HPLC is UV detector

> ⑤ Refractive Index (RI) detector is sensitive to environmental changes like pressure and temperature, but not very sensitive to solutes

 ⑹ Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)

> ① ICP: Introduces the sample into argon plasma formed by high-frequency induction coil, measures emitted spectral lines and intensity at 6000 ~ 8000 K when atoms in excited state move to ground state

> ② Excited electrons move to ground state within 10<sup>-7</sup> ~ 10<sup>-8</sup> seconds

> ③ The sample emits light corresponding to the energy difference, which is then spectrally processed using a diffraction grating spectrometer, and the intensity of light is measured for each wavelength.

> ④ **Application 1:** ICP-MS

 ⑺ Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)

## **4. Experimental Techniques**

 ⑴ Fundamentals of Chemical Experiments

> ① Experiments with toxic gases are conducted in a hood

> ② Dilute sulfuric acid is prepared by adding water to a beaker before adding concentrated sulfuric acid

> ③ When transferring concentrated hydrochloric acid, use a glass rod to guide the acid along the beaker wall

> ④ Due to sodium hydroxide's high moisture absorption, accurate weighing is challenging

> ⑤ The produced NaOH solution is not stored in glass containers for long periods

> ⑥ If a mercury thermometer breaks, sprinkle sufficient sulfur to absorb the mercury vapor and collect it after a day

⑵ Titration and Standardization of Solutions

> ① Titration: an experimental method for determining the amount of an unknown analyte

>> ○ Buret: an apparatus for delivering/measuring volume

>> ○ Using a buret, add a solution of known concentration until the sample is completely consumed.

>> ○  Use reactions that proceed rapidly and go to completion upon addition.

> ② Standardization

>> ○ Primary standard: a substance that can be used to prepare a solution of accurately known concentration

>>> ○ <b>Condition 1.</b> Must be obtainable in a pure form (definite composition).

>>> ○ <b>Condition 2.</b> Should be easy to purify.

>>> ○ <b>Condition 3.</b> Should have a high molar mass to minimize relative weighing error.

>> ○ Standard solution: a solution, standardized with a primary standard, suitable for use in titrations.

>> ○ Standardization: the process of accurately determining the concentration of a titrant using an aqueous solution of a primary standard

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> Use an aqueous solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) as a primary standard to determine the concentration of NaOH(aq); in this case, NaOH is the standard solution.

 ⑶ Direct and Indirect Titration

> ① Direct Titration: Method of directly determining the amount of analyte

>> ○ **Condition 1:** Rapid reaction between analyte and standard solution

>> ○ **Condition 2:** Complete reaction

>> ○ **Condition 3:** Suitable indicator available at equivalence point

>> ○ Example 1: Measuring the concentration of acetic acid using NaOH standard solution

>>> CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + OH<sup>-</sup> → CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O

>> ○ Example 2: Measuring the concentration of Cl<sup>-</sup> using AgNO<sub>3</sub> standard solution

>>> Ag<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup> → AgCl

> ② Indirect Titration: Used when direct titration conditions are not met

>> ○ Substitution titration: a method in which a solution that reacts completely with the analyte is added in excess, and the resulting product is then titrated.

>>> ○ Example: Quantification of metal cations using EDTA

>>>> ○ **Step 1:** Add magnesium's EDTA chelate compound (MgY2-) to a solution containing metal cation Mn+

>>>>> MgY2- + Mn+ → MYn-4 + Mg2+

>>>> ○ **Step 2:** Titrate the resulting excess Mg2+ with EDTA

>>>> ○ Eriochrome Black T or Calmagite can be used as indicators

>>>> ○ The molar amount of Mg2+ measured in **Step 2** equals the molar amount of Mn+ present in the original solution

>> ○ Back Titration: Adding excess standard solution and titrating the remaining substance

>>> ○ Used when direct reaction between analyte and standard solution is slow

>>> ○ Example 1: Quantification of Ni2+ using back titration

>>>> ○ **Step 1:** Add excess EDTA standard solution to the sample solution containing Ni2+ ions

>>>>> Ni2+ + Y4- → NiY2-

>>>> ○ **Step 2:** After the reaction is complete, titrate the remaining EDTA with Mg<sup>2+</sup> to determine its concentration.

>>>>>> Mg2+ + Y4- → MgY2-

>>>> ○ **Step 3:** Mg2+ forms a complex with Eriochrome Black T indicator, changing color from blue to violet

>>>> ○ The moles of Ni<sup>2+</sup> in the initial solution are given by the moles of EDTA added in <b>Step 1</b> minus the moles of EDTA measured in <b>Step 2</b> (i.e., <b>Step 1</b> − <b>Step 2</b>).

>>> ○ Example 2: DNP Method (2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine colorimetric method)

>>>> ○ **Step 1:** Under sulfuric acid, oxidation substance and DNP undergo dehydration reaction to form bi-2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazone

>>>> ○ **Step 2:** By colorimetrically quantifying the orange-red bis(2,4-dinitrophenyl)hydrazone, the oxidized form of the substance can be determined.

 ⑷ Removal of Interfering Substances

> ① Masking Agent: Substance that prevents unwanted reactions (side reactions) from occurring

> ② Enable a reaction that reacts with—and removes—the species participating in side reactions.

>> ○ Example: Quantification of copper in steel samples

>>> ○ Main reaction for quantification: Cu2+ + 2I- → Cu + I2

>>> ○ Undesirable reaction: 2Fe3+ + 6I- → 2Fe + 3I2

>>> ○ Masking agent: Adding F<sup>-</sup> forms FeF<sub>3</sub>(s) via Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 3 F<sup>-</sup> → FeF<sub>3</sub>(s), thereby preventing side reactions.

> ③ Separation by precipitation

>> ○ Precipitate the species involved in side reactions and remove it by filtration.

> ④ Separation by acidity (pH) control

>> ○ The solubility of hydroxides and acids depends on the solution pH.

>> ○ By adjusting pH, dissolve (or keep dissolved) specific hydroxides to achieve separation.

> ⑤ Separation by solvent extraction

>> ○ Chemical species distribute differently between two immiscible solvents.

>> ○ The target substance can be extracted into one of the solvents.
