## **2. [Gram Staining](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1021)**

⑴ Gram Staining: Staining technique developed by Gram

⑵ Gram Staining: Crystal violet → Safranin O

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Heat-fix the bacteria to the slide glass by passing it 2–3 times through an alcohol lamp flame.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Flood the smeared sample with crystal violet stain and leave for 20 seconds.

>> ○ At this point, all cells appear purple.

>> ○ Because crystal violet is a basic dye carrying a (+) charge, it binds strongly to the teichoic acids of Gram-positive bacteria.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Briefly rinse the stain off in a tube filled with distilled water and remove any remaining moisture.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Flood the smear with iodine solution (I<sub>2</sub>–KI) and leave for 1 minute.

>> ○ Iodine forms a crystal violet–iodine complex, preventing color change and decolorization (acts as a mordant agent).

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Dip the slide in a tube containing 95% EtOH to wash off the iodine solution, moving it in and out.

>> ○ Only Gram-positive bacteria remain purple.

>> ○ In Gram-positive bacteria, alcohol shrinks the cell wall, trapping the I<sub>2</sub>–crystal violet complex within the cytoplasm.

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. Gently rinse the slide by dipping it in distilled water to stop decolorization.

> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup>. Flood the smear with safranin and leave for 1 minute.

>> ○ Gram-positive bacteria remain purple.

>> ○ Gram-negative bacteria take up safranin and appear red.

> ⑧ 8<sup>th</sup>. Rinse carefully with water for a few seconds, then remove moisture.

⑶ Gram-positive bacteria

> ① Structure: protoplasm → cell membrane → thick peptidoglycan layer.

> ② Peptidoglycan: alternating N-acetylglucosamine (N-AG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (N-AM) linked by β 1→4 bonds.

> ③ Form endospores, enabling resistance to high temperature and pressure.

> ④ Teichoic acids protruding beyond the peptidoglycan are covalently linked and observed only in Gram-positives.

>> ○ Teichoic acids contain glutamic acid and thus carry a negative charge.

> ⑤ <b>Examples:</b> <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i>.

⑷ Gram-negative bacteria

> ① Structure: protoplasm → cell membrane → periplasmic space → thin peptidoglycan → periplasmic space → LPS, outer membrane.

> ② LPS (lipopolysaccharide): toxic and a target of the immune system.

>> ○ The toxicity of botox is also attributed to LPS.

>> ○ Penicillin cannot pass through LPS.

>> ○ Causes blood coagulation and high fever.

> ③ Outer membrane: contains porins and is more permeable than the cell membrane.

> ④ Periplasmic space:

>> ○ The compartment separating the peptidoglycan layer from the cell membrane and outer membrane.

>> ○ A cellular space important for functions such as metabolism and transport.

> ⑤ <b>Examples:</b> <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>.

## **3\. Antibiotic Susceptibility Test** (AST)

⑴ Overview

> ① CFU (colony forming unit): Number of colonies formed by bacteria or fungal spores in a sample

>> ○ Formula can be used if necessary: Sample's CFU = CFU of diluted sample × dilution factor

> ② MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration): Minimum concentration of an antibiotic that inhibits microbial growth

> ③ MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration): Minimum concentration at which no microorganisms appear even after subculture on a nutrient medium

>> ○ Essentially, the minimum concentration at which bacteria are killed

>> ○ MBC ≤ MIC

> ④ Can provide information about the bacteria's identity

⑵ Broth dilution test (broth microdilution method)

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Prepare varying antibiotic concentrations, then add microbes at the same CFU.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. MIC determination: after overnight incubation, determine the lowest antibiotic concentration at which no visible turbidity appears.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. MBC determination: subculture each sample onto nutrient medium and determine the lowest antibiotic concentration that yields no colonies.

> ④ A limitation is that it relies on optical density.

⑶ Disc diffusion method

> ① Measure the diameter of the inhibition zone produced by the drug.

> ② Follow the EUCAST guidelines.

⑷ Epsilometer test (E-test)

> ① By generating a gradient of antibiotic concentrations on a single plate, the MIC can be measured directly and conveniently.

> ② The MBC cannot be measured.

⑸ SCMA (single-cell morphological analysis)

> ① Motivation: when determining the MIC from blood samples, the result strongly depends on the initial bacterial concentration.

> ② MIC can be determined easily using optical microscopy.

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Ames Test**

⑴ Overview

> ① Genetic toxicity assessment method developed by Dr. Bruce Ames' team at the University of California, Berkeley

> ② Used to identify mutagenic and carcinogenic agents: Shows a strong correlation with carcinogenicity test results; quick and simple

> ③ Commonly used for screening before phase 1 of drug development

> ④ Verify if back mutation occurs using auxotrophic mutations

>> ○ Reversion mutation: Requires the same mutation mechanism, typically a point mutation

> ⑤ Uses Salmonella typhimurium sensitive to mutagens

> ⑥ Colonies decrease when using strains with normal DNA repair functions

> ⑦ Commonly used test strains

>> ○ Salmonella typhimurium TA98

>> ○ Salmonella typhimurium TA100

>> ○ Salmonella typhimurium TA1535

>> ○ Salmonella typhimurium TA1537

>> ○ Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA (pKM101)

⑵ Experimental procedure

> ① Prepare <i>S. typhimurium</i> mutants by strain.

> ② Prepare solid minimal-medium agar plates and spread the strains uniformly.

> ③ Place, at the center of each plate, a disk impregnated with one of the following:

>> ○ Water: negative control

>> ○ Liver enzymes: negative control

>> ○ Chemical: experimental group

>> ○ Water + liver enzymes: negative control

>> ○ Chemical + liver enzymes: If the colony count is similar to that of the chemical-only group, the chemical is a direct mutagen, i.e., it does not require metabolic activation in the pathway to become mutagenic.

> ④ Incubate at 37 °C for 16 hours.

> ⑤ If colonies appear, they are revertants that have lost the auxotrophic requirement due to a reverse mutation.

## **5\. Cross-Feeding Experiment**

⑴ Overview: Experiment to determine the sequence of metabolic actions

⑵ Premises

> ① Mutant A has a mutation in gene a, B has a mutation in gene b, C has a mutation in gene c

>> ○ For convenience, let's denote the substance produced by gene x as X

> ② In mutants unable to synthesize proline, the intermediates of proline biosynthesis accumulate inside the cell.

> ③ The accumulated proline-biosynthesis intermediates diffuse through the agar medium.

⑶ Results

> ① 22 °C: A—only some strains grow well; B—all strains grow well; C—no strains grow.

> ② 30 °C: A—no strains grow; B and C—all strains grow well.

> ③ 42 °C: A—no strains grow; B—only some strains grow well; C—all strains grow well.

<br>

⑷ Interpretation

> ① Analysis at 22 °C

>> ○ Substance C acts later than substance A: ?? → A → C; the A strain can survive because it has enzyme c.

>> ○ The B strain is prototrophic (non-auxotrophic).

> ② At 30 °C

>> ○ The B strain is prototrophic.

>> ○ The C strain is prototrophic.

>> ○ Given point (②) above, the C strain does not accumulate the substance; therefore nothing is transferred to the A strain.

> ③ At 42 °C

>> ○ The B strain is auxotrophic; it is a temperature-sensitive mutant.

>> ○ Substance A acts later than substance B: ?? → B → A; the B strain can survive because it has enzyme a.

>> ○ The C strain is prototrophic.

⑸ Tips for interpretation

> ① The later an enzyme acts in the pathway, the more severe the mutation.

> ② From the 22 °C experiment, we infer A → C.

> ③ From the 42 °C experiment, we infer B → C.
