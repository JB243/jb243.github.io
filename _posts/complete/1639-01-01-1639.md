**1. Capitalism**

⑴ Definition

> ① An economic system in which each individual pursues private interests  
> ② An economic system in which the market mechanism operates

⑵ Stages of capitalism

> ① **Stage 1.** Spontaneous Order  
> ② **Stage 2.** The State Based on Public Authority  
> ③ **Stage 3.** Market Integration and Globalization

⑶ Critical perspectives **:** Led by anti-globalization movements

> ① An economic system where even things that cannot (or should not) become commodities turn into commodities **:** environment, human rights, etc.  
> ② An economic system where capitalists exploit workers  
> ③ An economic system that threatens subsistence economies through monopolistic markets

---

**2. Stage 1. Spontaneous Order**

⑴ Overview

> ① An economic system formed naturally  
> ② Drove the economic history of the Middle Ages

⑵ The rise of long-distance trade

> ① Overview  
>> ○ Need for long-distance trade **:** diversification of goods  
>> ○ **Downside 1.** Frequent fraud and breaches of contract  
>> ○ **Downside 2.** Difficult to punish contract violations  
>> ○ **Downside 3.** Differences in trading customs

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Local trade **:** developed naturally  
> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. As local trade developed, local commercial communities emerged  
> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Local commercial communities buffered the downsides of long-distance trade, thereby promoting it

⑶ Long-distance trade → activation of money

> ① (Reference) Money in the Roman era  
>> ○ Gold coins were central; silver coins and small change were supplementary  
>> ○ Gold coins **:** used under a tributary (tax-in-kind) system  
>> ○ After Rome fell, the gold–silver–copper tri-metallic system disappeared

> ② (Reference) Emergence of silver coinage  
>> ○ By the late Middle Ages, silver coinage emerged  
>> ○ Silver coinage: used seasonally for selling agricultural products at harvest time and paying rents/dues

> ③ Emergence of the gold–silver–copper tri-metallic system  
>> ○ **Emergence 1.** Circulation of gold coins with the expansion of long-distance trade  
>>> ○ Example: the gold coin “florin” was introduced in Florence (1252)  
>> ○ **Emergence 2.** Circulation of small coins with the growth of the urban lower-middle-class economy  
>> ○ **Result 1.** Converted multidimensional rationality into one-dimensional rationality  
>>> ○ Encouraged consumers to make economic judgments  
>>> ○ Result 1-1. Resolved various disputes  
>>> ○ Result 1-2. Deepened understanding of how money works  
>> ○ **Result 2.** The monetary system was used in a commodity economy  
>>> ○ Rome **:** the monetary system was used to operate a tributary economy  
>> ○ **Result 3.** Mass circulation of money caused confusion **:** development of credit transactions

⑷ Activation of money → birth of commercial cities

> ① Determining factors  
>> ○ Areas favorable to commerce **:** zones advantageous for protecting property rights and business rights  
>> ○ Areas where profits from long-distance trade are maximized

> ② Factors of change  
>> ○ Regime change **:** the more autocratic the regime, the more commercial cities decline  
>> ○ Changes in distribution routes **:** altered by war, transport technology, regional specialization structures, etc.

**3. Stage 2. The State Based on Public Authority**

⑴ Overview

> ① The state controls the market  
> ② Drove the economic history of the early modern period

⑵ Economies of scale → emergence of the state

> ① As group size increases, economies of scale are enjoyed, but the growth rate of total benefits gradually decreases  
> ② **Diseconomy of scale 1.** Disagreements among members over which public goods to produce—self-interest, heterogeneity, etc.—increase the cost of reaching consensus  
> ③ **Diseconomy of scale 2.** Additional public management costs arise for public goods  
> ④ Borders form at an appropriate scale

⑶ Emergence of the state

> ① **Cause 1.** Struggle against the Church  
>> ○ Driving forces **:** the Renaissance (emphasis on human reason), the Reformation  
>> ○ Example **:** in 14th-century France, the king surpassed the pope  
>> ○ Example **:** the king became able to tax Church property as well

> ② **Cause 2.** Struggle against the Holy Roman Empire  
>> ○ The Holy Roman Empire was a system of pope and emperor  
>> ○ As papal authority declined, the Holy Roman Empire weakened  
>> ○ In states under the Holy Roman Empire’s influence, centralized states emerged later  
>> ○ Example **:** the Golden Bull (1356) weakened the emperor’s authority

> ③ **Cause 3.** Struggle against the nobility

> ④ What the emergence of the state looked like  
>> ○ Varied by region  
>> ○ Combined border formation, formation of national sentiment, and strengthening of the king’s bureaucracy  
>> ○ Accompanied by countless wars

⑷ Emergence of the state → legal control

> ① The state’s third-party enforcement system  
>> ○ Advantage **:** reduces transaction costs  
>> ○ Disadvantage **:** slows the development of the market economy  
>> ○ The character of the state is defined by the character of a small ruling class

> ② The case of England  
>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Magna Carta  
>>> ○ Applied not only to free peasants but also to the king  
>>> ○ Development of human rights and property rights  
>>> ○ Common law: establishment of a case-law-based order  
>>>> ○ When lawmakers make laws, they tend to exclude rules unfavorable to themselves  
>>>> ○ The “golden rule” applied in the legislative process

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Glorious Revolution (1688)  
>>> ○ After the Magna Carta, the English Crown increased revenue through selling various privileges  
>>> ○ As this sale of privileges became excessive, Parliament weakened royal power in 1688

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Formation of government institutions  
>>> ○ A Parliament was organized so that representatives of each estate could reach agreement within Parliament  
>>> ○ After the Glorious Revolution, merchant representatives in Parliament captured the highest state power

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Development of open competition for rent-seeking privileges  
>>> ○ By making the acquisition of privileges an open competition, an appropriate allocation of privileges was achieved  
>>> ○ In some cases, privilege allocation still failed due to cohesion among interest groups

> ③ The case of France  
>> ○ Formation of government institutions  
>> ○ A privilege-allocation system based on cronyism developed  
>>> ○ The value of privileges was not fixed  
>>> ○ Even privilege-holders faced the risk of having privileges taken away **:** frequent concealment of techniques  
>>> ○ Administrative bureaucrats were not well informed about industrial technology and commerce

> ④ The beginnings of patent law  
>> ○ The paradox of patent law  
>>> ○ If patent law is weak **:** inventors’ incentives weaken  
>>> ○ If patent law is strong **:** hinders competition, suppresses commerce  
>>> ○ Solution **:** set an expiration period for monopoly rights

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Venetian Patent Statute (1474)  
>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Ipswich textile worker case in England  
>>> ○ The court supported monopoly rights for new invention projects  
>>> ○ Patent protection requirements (1624): anything lacking novelty and a limited term of validity is illegal  
>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. U.S. Patent Act (1790)  
>>> ○ Collected only the advantages of each country’s patent application system  
>>> ○ Patent filing costs became very low

⑸ Legal control → control through economic policy

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Incorporation of merchant law  
>> ○ Disappearance of merchant courts  
>>> ○ Around the 12th century, European governments systematically codified merchant law: they adopted a substantial portion of customary law  
>>> ○ England’s Statute of the Staple (1353): judgments could be made by merchant law even in royal courts  
>>>> ○ A policy to attract cases to royal courts  
>>>> ○ Merchant courts still remained

>>> ○ Edward Coke’s ruling (1606)  
>>>> ○ **Ruling 1.** What was done in merchant courts was “finding a compromise”  
>>>> ○ **Ruling 2.** What was done in royal courts was “confirming justice”  
>>>> ○ Final adjudicative authority was granted to royal courts  
>>>> ○ Led to the disappearance of merchant courts

>> ○ Evolution of merchant law within common law  
>>> ○ Continental civil law accepted new commercial practices better than common law  
>>> ○ English courts tried to accept new commercial practices to some extent  
>>> ○ Limitation **:** to be recognized as precedent, a long-established practice had to exist first, so adoption was insufficient

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Emergence of national merchants  
>> ○ With the development of merchant law, systems for protecting domestic merchants developed  
>> ○ (Reference) The era of Hanseatic merchants  
>>> ○ Hanseatic merchants obtained commercial rights from foreign rulers, occurring simultaneously in many places  
>>> ○ Competitive English merchants felt reverse discrimination **:** tariffs, various privileges

>> ○ Emergence of national merchants  
>>> ○ Shift from a passive trading nation to an active trading nation  
>>>> ○ Shift from a wool-producing country to a woolen-textile-producing country  
>>>> ○ Adventurer merchants developed and foreign trade expanded

>>> ○ Demand for reciprocity **:** enactment of protective ordinances for English merchants (1377)  
>>>> ○ English merchants were dissatisfied with the rights Hanseatic merchants enjoyed in England  
>>>> ○ Demanded reciprocity so English merchants could enjoy the same rights in Hanseatic cities  
>>>> ○ As absolutist states developed, Hanseatic one-sided privileged trade disappeared by the late 16th century

>>> ○ Market rules aimed at market control  
>>>> ○ With the emergence of national merchants, Hanseatic merchants felt threatened  
>>>> ○ Hanseatic merchants enacted “foreigner laws” to regulate the market

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Mercantilist economic policies  
>> ○ Economic policies of the nation-state  
>>> ○ Pushed economic policies to strengthen the state, improving economic power  
>>> ○ Used national power to promote economic growth

>> ○ Economic nationalism  
>>> ○ Competition among states to secure dominance over overseas colonies and trade  
>>>> ○ Merchants’ interest in securing business rights  
>>>> ○ The state’s interest in securing new revenue sources from overseas colonies  
>>>> ○ Alignment of the two interests

>>> ○ Economic control dispersed across localities moved to the central government  
>>>> ○ Tariffs

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Introduction of a state monetary management system  
>> ○ Control of coin exports and imports  
>>> ○ Bullionism emerged in the 16th century  
>>> ○ The downfall of Spain, which obtained massive amounts of gold coins from colonies, is suggestive in many ways

>> ○ Banknote issuance and state intervention **:** using the Bank of England as an example  
>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Tried to establish a bank competitive with the Netherlands’ Bank of Amsterdam  
>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The Glorious Revolution institutionalized national debt distinct from the monarch’s personal debt  
>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Needed an institution to handle government finance  
>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Founded by powerful London merchants and financiers (1694)  
>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Monopoly on banknote issuance → era of free banking → monopoly on banknote issuance  
>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Because banknotes circulated only in London, they could not be used for small transactions

⑸ Rise and fall of the welfare state

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. The late-19th-century Long Depression; the Great Depression of the 1930s **:** decline of the laissez-faire view of the state  
> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. World wars **:** rise of statism; contributed to building the infrastructure of the welfare state  
> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. World wars caused globalization to retreat  
> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Introduction of the welfare state  
> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Crisis of the welfare state  
>> ○ Promoted international outflows of capital  
>> ○ Promoted outflows of labor from underdeveloped regions  
>> ○ Economic development outside Europe **:** Japan, NIEs, ASEAN, BRICs
