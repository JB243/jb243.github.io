## **1. Laws of Trade**

⑴ **Gravity theory of trade:** The volume of trade between two countries is proportional to the size of their economies and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

> ① It fit especially well in the past, when overland transport costs were extremely high.
>
>> ○ Luxury goods such as silk could be transported over land, but bulky goods such as grain could not.
>
> ② Sea freight costs were far cheaper than overland transport costs.
>
>> ○ As ships’ carrying capacity continued to increase and maritime transport costs decreased, the feasible distance of sea trade expanded greatly.
>>
>> ○ This became a foundation of the Commercial Revolution.

⑵ **Henri Pirenne’s border effect:** Cultural, religious, and legal differences have a more negative impact on trade than distance does.

> ① **Example:** Although geographically close, North and South Korea—politically very different—have a strong border effect.
>
> ② Cultural, religious, and legal differences are variable, unlike fixed geographic distance.
>
> ③ **Mitigation 1.** Because trade promotes a common language and commercial law, border effects tend to be reduced by trade itself.
>
> ④ **Mitigation 2.** In long-distance transactions, sellers and buyers cannot meet face-to-face or inspect the goods directly, so demand emerges for shared standards for weight, volume, quality, etc.
>
> ⑤ **Mitigation 3.** Towns provided legal services to facilitate the resolution of contract disputes.
>
>> ○ As trade expanded, these towns were replaced by permanent trading hubs in major European cities.
>>
>> ○ Populations re-concentrated into these cities.
>>
>> ○ Merchant courts → replaced by local courts **:** Maritime law developed into the Hague–Visby Rules.
>
> ⑥ **Mitigation 4.** Standardization/unification of language
>
>> ○ During the period when Germanic tribes entered the Roman world, Europe was linguistically heterogeneous.
>>
>> ○ Traders and merchants adopted a single language within each region.

## **2. Example 1. Europe and the Laws of Trade**

⑴ **Europe’s geographic and economic continuity:** Similarity, proximity, and the absence of border effects stimulated trade.

> ① **Similarity 1.** 80% of the total population of the Roman Empire lived within the borders of today’s European Union.
>
> ② **Similarity 2.** The territory of the Carolingian Empire is quite similar to the boundaries of today’s Europe.
>
> ③ **Similarity 3.** Thereafter, until the age of empires in the 19th century, self-governing cities persisted, including city-states such as Venice.
>
> ④ Most of EU countries’ trade occurs within the EU.
>
> ⑤ **Proximity:** Denmark trades more with smaller Sweden than with larger Britain or France.
>
> ⑥ **Absence of border effects:** Countries that are intensive in trade tend to trade more with one another.

⑵ **Europe’s center shifts northward**

> ① After Arabs conquered North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th–9th centuries, Mediterranean trade declined.
>
>> ○ Henri Pirenne explained this as cultural/religious division creating a border effect for trade.
>>
>> ○ Recent research suggests the decline was not that severe, and that reduced income, in addition to border effects, also played a role.
>>
>> ○ The economic level of the Mediterranean world did not recover for several centuries after Arab expansion.
>
> ② In late Rome, high-quality pottery was shipped from production sites in southern France throughout the empire, but it is not found north of the Rhine in Germany.
>
>> ○ **Reason:** Trade networks were underdeveloped, and tastes and preferences differed across regions with the river as a boundary.
>>
>> ○ These border effects were effectively reduced during Germanic expansion and the medieval revival of the European economy.
>>
>> ○ As a result, Europe’s center shifted to the north.

## **3. Example 2. Russia’s Exceptionalism**

⑴ **Russia’s substantial isolation**

> ○ Europe’s Renaissance had little effect on Russia.
>
> ○ Unlike Europe, political absolutism survived for a long time in Russia.
>
> ○ While other parts of Europe abolished serfdom in the 16th century, Russia introduced serfdom.
>
> ○ Industrialization, standardization of weights and measures, and the spread of schooling were delayed.
>
> ○ After the Germanic migrations into the Roman world, local alphabets were replaced by the Latin alphabet (Latinization), but Russia was an exception.
>
> ○ Russia did not participate in the late-19th-century shift toward free trade.
>
> ○ It did not contribute to the scientific awakening of Western Europe in the 19th century.
>
> ○ Anti-Westernism—opposition to commercialization, individualism, and rationalism—emerged as a pioneering ideology in the 19th century.
>
> ○ Catch-up and modernization began in the late 19th century, but did not proceed in the direction of integration into Europe.
>
> ○ In fact, this isolationism persists **:** In 2005, Russia’s share of total exports among European countries was only about 1–2%.

⑵ **Why Russia failed to be incorporated into Europe**

> ① **Reason 1. Limits of imperial expansion**
>
>> ○ The formation of an empire tends to create homogeneity in language, religion, and law, but expansion has limits.
>>
>> ○ Examples include soaring costs of maintaining security in border regions and declining imperial revenue due to the inflow of low-income populations.
>>
>> ○ As a result, the integrative force of the Roman Empire and trade did not reach Russia’s core.
>>
>> ○ Because Russia did not experience a history of integration with Europe, cultural heterogeneity between Europe and Russia strengthened (border effect).
>
> ② **Reason 2. Gravity theory of trade — Russia’s relative poverty**
>
>> ○ Russia’s vast area and low population density make it difficult to generate trade at sufficient scale.
>>
>> ○ Lacking exposure to the knowledge, culture, goods, and institutions brought by trade → relative backwardness is prolonged and isolation persists.
>
> ③ **Reason 3. Another aspect of Pirenne’s border effect — Russia’s harsh land**
>
>> ○ Russia ran its empire by extracting resources from the periphery and offering them to the Tsar.
>>
>> ○ This naturally formed due to Russia’s uniquely harsh natural environment.
>>
>> ○ As a result, whereas European empires—based on colonial development overseas and wealth—advanced free trade, Russia, with strong autocracy, pursued policies unfavorable to merchants and caused commercial cities to decline.
>>
>> ○ Therefore, it failed to develop free trade.
>
> ④ **Reason 4. Historical context for anti-Westernism**
>
>> ○ Russia was once incorporated into the Mongol Empire.
>>
>> ○ Watching the Mongol Empire collapse under strong crusading forces from Poland, Lithuania, Hungary, etc., Russia developed fear of Western society.
>>
>> ○ As a result, anti-Westernism spread, suppressing individualism and rationalism, blocking Renaissance culture, and reducing free trade with the West.
>>
>> ○ In fact, the emergence of socialist ideology was driven by backlash against Western material civilization.

## **4. Example 3. The History of the Spread of the Metric System**

⑴ **France**

> ① In 1789, the French Revolution broke down various institutions and redefined almost all systems of weights and measures.
>
> ② In 1790, France adopted the metric system and worked to standardize it internationally.

⑵ **Britain and the Commonwealth**

> ① **Why Britain adopted the metric system late:** Because its rival, France, devised it.
>
> ② Reasons Britain eventually adopted the metric system
>
>> ○ Most countries trading with Britain had adopted the metric system.
>>
>> ○ The British public was already aware of the metric system.
>
> ③ Because Britain led the Commonwealth, other Commonwealth countries also transitioned to the metric system after Britain did.
>
>> ○ India **:** 1954
>>
>> ○ United Kingdom **:** 1965
>>
>> ○ Ireland **:** 1967
>>
>> ○ Pakistan **:** 1967
>>
>> ○ New Zealand **:** 1969
>>
>> ○ Australia **:** 1970
>>
>> ○ South Africa **:** 1971
>>
>> ○ Malaysia **:** 1972
>>
>> ○ Canada **:** 1973
>>
>> ○ Hong Kong : 1976
>>
>> ○ Jamaica **:** 1998
>
>> ○ To this day, Liberia and Myanmar are the only countries using the yard–pound system.

⑶ **Russia**

> ① Because of Russia’s exceptionalism, it adopted the metric system only in 1924.

⑷ **United States**

> ① Industries that depend on communication with scientists worldwide and heavily on trade—such as pharmaceuticals—adopt the metric system.
>
> ② Industries producing mainly for the domestic market, such as beer, still use customary measures.
>
> ③ International brands such as Coca-Cola use the metric system even in the United States.
>
> ④ **Reason 1.** A base-3 (ternary) system had been established for a long time (the irrationality of history).
>
> ⑤ **Reason 2.** Because the U.S. is large and powerful, there may be a psychological barrier to adopting France’s patriotic system of measures.
>
> ⑥ **Reason 3.** Because the U.S. values freedom—independence war, 50 states, etc.
