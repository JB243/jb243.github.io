**1.** Malthusian Theory

**2.** Critiques of Malthusian Theory

**1\. Malthusian Theory** (Malthusian theory; a “survival-of-the-fittest” population theory)

 ⑴ Europe at the time the Malthusian theory emerged

> ① The logic of mercantilism and the Enlightenment was dominant.

> ② Around the publication of the first edition of *An Essay on the Principle of Population*, European society became a crucible of extreme turmoil and miserable living conditions—such as the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolution, and the Industrial Revolution.

> ③ Malthus developed his own original theory about population problems, contributing to the development of modern population theory.

 ⑵ **Assumption 1.** The amount of land has a physical limit. In other words, there is a limit to food production.

> ① Population growth will eventually exceed the population that can be supported by food production.

 ⑶ **Assumption 2.** There is no technological progress. In other words, there is no increase in the efficiency of land use.

 ⑷ **Assumption 3.** Human reproductive power is assumed to be indefinitely greater than the power of land to produce food for humans.

> ① Food is necessary for survival.

> ② Sexual desire between the sexes is necessary and will remain almost as it is now in the future.

 ⑸ Conclusion **:** Population growth, constrained by land limits, ultimately reduces income and eventually stops.

> ① Food production increases arithmetically **:** 1, 2, 3, ···

> ② Population increases geometrically **:** 1, 2, 4, ···

> ③ The point where population growth stops is called the Malthusian equilibrium.

> ④ In any social group, the birth rate and the death rate must be the same.

> ⑤ In any social group, the population exists up to the level that food production can support.

> ⑥ In any social group, wages must be fixed at the cost of subsistence.

> ⑦ Malthus argued that, for humans to survive despite food scarcity, there must be “checks” that restrain population growth.

> ⑧ Population growth ultimately increases the labor force, but in turn causes wage declines and poverty—providing a basis for the “iron law of wages.”

 ⑹ **Application 1.** Social influence

> ① Helped the development of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection.

> ② Influenced by Malthus’s population theory, the British Parliament enacted the Census Act in 1800 and conducted a census every 10 years starting in 1801.

 ⑺ **Application 2.** The mechanism by which population growth declines

> ① Preventive checks (moral restraint) **:** The birth rate is controlled (contraception, late marriage, celibacy, abstinence, etc.).

> ② Positive checks (active restraint) **:** The death rate is controlled (war, disease, famine, etc.).

**2\. Critiques of Malthusian Theory**

 ⑴ **Critique 1.** Historical population trends **:** The increase in world population unfolded in a way that cannot be explained by the Malthusian law.

> ① Under Malthusian theory, the population growth rate should be 0.

> ② World population changed as follows:

>> ○ 6–8 million (10,000 BC)

>> ○ 250 million (AD 0)

>> ○ 1 billion (AD 1800)

>> ○ 6 billion (AD 2000)

>> ○ Up to the mid-19th century, Europe’s population increased over the long run.

> ④ After the decline of the Roman Empire **:** Europe’s population temporarily fell sharply but recovered quickly.

> ⑤ After the mid-14th-century Black Death **:** Europe’s population temporarily fell sharply but recovered quickly.

> ⑥ After 1750, population increased meaningfully.

>> ○ Before the demographic transition **:** high total fertility and low life expectancy

>> ○ After the demographic transition **:** low total fertility and high life expectancy

>> ○ Factors behind declining mortality **:** assumed to be advances in medical technology, improved nutrition, and increased immunity. Not clearly established.

>> ○ Factors behind declining fertility **:** contraception; substitution effect when wages rise; reduced child mortality; whether childrearing costs can be externalized; risks of equal partition inheritance.

>> ○ It is difficult to explain why fertility declined earlier in France than in industrializing Britain.

 ⑵ **Critique 2.** Historically, the flow “population increase → decline in per-capita income → population decline” is not observed.

> ① After the Neolithic Revolution **:** agricultural technology limited the amount of cultivable land, but population did not decline.

> ② After the collapse of the Roman Empire or after the Black Death **:** population declined, but even though much land was abandoned, income did not increase.

> ③ In the 17th–18th centuries **:** population reached pre–Black Death levels, but there was no decline in per-capita income.

 ⑶ **Critique 3.** If Malthusian theory holds, marginal product and wages should be constant.

> ① However, the marginal product per unit of land continued to increase.

> ② Wages also did not remain at the subsistence level **:** cultural differences, differences in living standards, and differences in the [Engel coefficient](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2013) indirectly reveal this.

 ⑷ **Critique 4.** The effects of technological progress—such as Huang’s law or Moore’s law—have continued to appear since the start of agrarian society.

> ① **Example 1.** Land-use intensity

>> ○ Primitive land-use intensity **:** 0.05

>> ○ Modern Europe **:** 1

>> ○ Modern Asia **:** 2

> ② **Example 2.** Empirical knowledge about fertilizers and the adoption of the heavy plow

 ⑸ **Critique 5.** Trade and proximity to urban centers **:** Another explanation in which population growth itself can lead to increased output.

> ① Trade contributes to using land in better ways.

> ② Urban manure resolves nitrogen shortages.

> ③ New knowledge from cities spreads quickly.

> ④ Diverse urban demand enables diversified cultivation portfolios, acting as insurance against natural disasters.

> ⑤ Philip Hoffman’s research on total factor productivity (TFP)

>> ○ He estimated TFP for early modern (ancien régime) French agriculture from 1522 to 1789.

>> ○ He noted that developing resources and opportunities well requires interregional trade and proximity to major urban areas.

 ⑹ **Critique 6.** Livi-Bacci’s long-run Malthusian population trajectory

> ① Expected result **:** population grows rapidly at first; when land scarcity begins, the population growth rate falls and eventually becomes 0.

> ② Actual result **:** the long-run trend remains positive, rejecting the long-run Malthusian population trajectory.

 ⑺ **Critique 7.** The long-run decline of real wages in England as population increased again after the Black Death

> ① This has been used as representative evidence for the Malthusian law.

> ② In fact, it is empirically shown that changes in temperature caused changes in grain output.

 ⑻ **Critique 8.** Galor’s unified growth theory **:** An attempt to reconcile and provide an alternative explanation by compromising with Malthusian theory

> ① Malthusian stagnation **:** technological progress is absorbed by population growth, so there is no increase in per-capita income.

> ② Post-Malthusian period **:** the rate of technological progress exceeds population growth, leading to modest per-capita income growth alongside high population growth.

> ③ Modern economic growth **:** quality of children is preferred over quantity; increased investment in children’s education lowers fertility → per-capita income rises rapidly.

> ④ **Criticism 1.** In the Malthusian stagnation period (i.e., up to 1500), income levels did increase persistently.

> ⑤ **Criticism 2.** The theory is too simple to capture the dynamic development of the real world.

 ⑼ **Critique 9.** Cointegration tests by Møller and Paul Sharp on data from 1560–1800

> ① **Conclusion 1.** Preventive checks existed even before the population reached a maximum; there is no evidence that positive checks existed.

>> ○ Evidence **:** Western Europe’s culture of late marriage; adjusting birth spacing based on expected child mortality; the fact that population growth did not suppress wages

>> ○ Malthus and contemporary scholars did not view fertility strategies as the result of household optimization.

>> ○ Modern economists and economic historians view fertility strategies as the result of optimal behavior.

> ② **Conclusion 2.** There is no evidence that population growth reduced real wages.

> ③ Final conclusion **:** 1560–1800 appears to be a post-Malthusian period, raising questions about the historical validity of Malthusian theory.

 ⑼ **Summary :** The only period in which Malthusian theory is believed to have held was the hunter-gatherer period.
