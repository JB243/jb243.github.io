## 1. National Income Determination Equation

⑴ **Formalization**

\[
Y = rK + wL + iT
\]

> ① **Y:** National income  
> ② **K:** Units of capital (units of physical capital)  
> ③ **L:** Number of workers (units of human capital)  
> ④ **T:** Units of land  
> ⑤ **r:** Profit per unit of capital  
> ⑥ **w:** Wage per worker  
> ⑦ **i:** Land rent per unit of land  

⑵ **Malthusian theory:** No increasing-returns effect

\[
r,\; w,\; i = \text{constant}
\]

## 2. Dual Approach to TFP

⑴ **Overview**

> ① **Growth accounting:** the relative contributions of the rate of technical progress, capital growth, and labor growth to economic growth  
> ② In the pre-industrial era, it is difficult to obtain (or to obtain accurately) information on capital, labor, and land  
> ③ The dual approach is a convenient indirect method: it infers growth by checking increases in factor payments per unit of input and increases in output  

⑵ **Derivation**

> ① The aggregate production function of the macroeconomy is represented under [constant returns to scale](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1893) (CRS, constant returns to scale)

>> ○ **Y:** Total output  
>> ○ **z:** Technology level  
>> ○ **K:** Capital input  
>> ○ **L:** Labor input  
>> ○ **T:** Land input  
>> ○ **α:** Capital income share  
>> ○ **β:** Labor income share  
>> ○ **1 − α − β:** Land income share  
>> ○ **Tip.** Solving with the Lagrange multiplier method yields: \(\alpha = rK / Y\), \(\beta = wL / Y\)

> ② Take ln on both sides and then take the differential (instantaneous growth rate)  
> ③ **Total factor productivity (TFP):** the rate of technical progress  

>> ○ The improvement in productivity (or the portion of economic growth) that cannot be explained by increases in land, human capital, and physical capital (which grow arithmetically in this setting)  

>>> ○ **Limitation 1.** Economic growth itself can have an uplifting effect (e.g., Adam Smith’s idea of the division of labor)  
>>> ○ **Limitation 2.** Increases in output due to weather, etc., can be mistaken for technical progress  

>>> ○ Nevertheless, TFP is still widely accepted as a useful tool  

>> ○ **Example:** The following example includes the contribution of land as well  

>>> ○ Output growth rate = 5% (real value)  
>>> ○ **Labor:** growth rate of labor hours = 5%, weight = 0.5  
>>> ○ **Capital:** capital growth rate = 5%, weight = 0.3  
>>> ○ **Land:** land growth rate = 1%, weight = 0.2  
>>> ○ **Conclusion:** \(\text{TFP} = 5\% - (0.5 \times 5\% + 0.3 \times 5\% + 0.2 \times 1\%) = 0.8\%\)

⑶ **Empirical studies on TFP**

> ① Philip Hoffman studied French agriculture from 1522 to 1789  

>> ○ He argued that external shocks such as the Wars of Religion and disorder resulted in a low long-run average for French agriculture  
>> ○ Even in the pre-industrial era, if resources and opportunities are developed rationally, agricultural TFP growth can reach 0.1–0.2%  
>> ○ Developing resources and opportunities well requires inter-regional trade and proximity to major urban areas  

> ② According to D. L. Farmer, even just before the Black Death, resources in England were being used efficiently  
> ③ Growth accounting for major countries
