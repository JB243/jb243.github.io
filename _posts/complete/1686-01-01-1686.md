**A. Insight 1.** **Power Law Distribution of Words**

 ⑴ Uniqueness of Words **:** The power-law distribution of words suggests that certain clusters of roots with more than 3 elements, as of March 22, 2022, follow a distribution of the number of elements. As expected, this displays a power-law distribution (also known as the power-law) phenomenon. This phenomenon appears as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer by continuously using certain words, and it can be observed across society, economy, culture, and various domains.

 ⑵ Frequency of Alphabet Usage **:** A similar interpretation of power-law distribution can be applied here as well. Note that the frequency of alphabet usage is also employed in decrypting Caesar ciphers.

 <br>

| Alphabet | Frequency (%) | Alphabet | Frequency (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 8.2 | N | 6.7 |
| B | 1.5 | O | 7.5 |
| C | 2.8 | P | 1.9 |
| D | 4.3 | Q | 0.1 |
| E | 12.7 | R | 6.0 |
| F | 2.2 | S | 6.3 |
| G | 2.0 | T | 9.1 |
| H | 6.1 | U | 2.8 |
| I | 7.0 | V | 1.0 |
| J | 0.2 | W | 2.3 |
| K | 0.8 | X | 0.1 |
| L | 4.0 | Y | 2.0 |
| M | 2.4 | Z | 0.1 |

**B. Insight 2.** Meaning of Words

⑴ **Uniqueness of Words**: Since words originate from different contexts, two words cannot have exactly the same meaning. Therefore, knowing the etymology of the word is important.

⑵ **Relationship between Sound and Meaning**: Do words that sound similar have similar meanings? It seems that there are onomatopoeic words in English as well, which I have systematically organized [here](https://jb243.github.io/pages/792).

⑶ **Relationship between Form and Meaning**: Do words with similar forms have similar meanings? For example, consider "baggage" and "luggage."

⑷ **Pronunciation**: Does difficulty in pronunciation mean that it is being pronounced incorrectly? That is, isn't the pronunciation of every word the most efficient way to produce that sound?

⑸ **History of Words:** Many English words, like 'consummate,' initially began with a more sexual meaning than one might think. However, it seems natural that a concept which becomes almost universally understood and occupies a significant part of our consciousness should become the origin of a word’s meaning.

⑹ **History of Grammar:** It is said that nouns were created first, followed by verbs. 

⑺ **Ambiguity of Words:** No word can be clearly defined as a point on the map of language. Words originate from specific etymologies or phenomena, but over time, their meanings become more concrete and sometimes change. Therefore, the meaning of a word is continuous and ambiguous, like a path on a map. However, the meaning of a word is similar to an electron's probability cloud; it only becomes clear when we try to 'retrieve' it in a specific context, much like observing an electron clarifies its position.

⑻ **Intonation:** It seems that each language has its own unique intonation rules that are hard to capture in writing. That might be why I feel like I can guess how to pronounce an unfamiliar English word, even if I’m seeing it for the first time.

<br>

**C. Insight 3.** Significance of Memorization

 ⑴ Amount of Information **:** Could it be that the more information there is, the harder it is to memorize?

 ⑵ Memorizing through Etymology and Association could potentially reduce the amount of information needed for memorization, leading to improvements in memorization speed, duration, and capacity. Could it be that humans have evolved to memorize knowledge in the form of networks or trees?

<br>

**D. Insight 4.** Martin Heidegger: Language is the home of existence.

 ⑴ The language used indicates the existence of the person using it.

 ⑵ Furthermore, the identity of each cultural sphere will likely be embodied in its specific words, grammar, etc.
