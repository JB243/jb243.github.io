## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ Definition

> ① A test method for comparing distributions of three or more groups

> ② Used for the same purpose as one-way ANOVA in parametric methods

> ③ Tests whether the group median is the same, not the mean

> ④ Sample sizes may vary across groups

⑵ (Reference) Choice of Test Method

> ① Single sample

>> ○ Parametric test: Single sample T-test

>> ○ Non-parametric test: Sign test, [Wilcoxon signed rank test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2099)

> ② Two samples (paired samples): Essentially the same as a single sample

>> ○ Parametric test: Paired sample T-test

>> ○ Non-parametric test: Sign test, [Wilcoxon signed rank test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2099)

> ③ Two samples (independent samples)

>> ○ Parametric test: Independent sample T-test

>> ○ Non-parametric test: [Wilcoxon rank sum test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2099)

> ④ Analysis of variance

>> ○ Parametric test: [ANOVA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1635)

>> ○ Non-parametric test: [Kruskal-Wallis test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1688)

> ⑤ Randomness

>> ○ Non-parametric test: Run test

> ⑥ Correlation analysis

>> ○ Pearson correlation coefficient

>> ○ Spearman rank correlation coefficient

## **2. Method**

 ⑴ Example sample

<br>

<br>

 ⑵ **Step 1.** Set up hypotheses

> ① Null hypothesis H0: Medians of each group are the same

> ② Alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub>: At least one group's median is different

⑶ **Step 2.** Assign ranks to 16 data points (four data points from each of four sample groups)

⑷ **Step 3.** Define the test statistic H as follows

> ① However, T<sub>i</sub> is the sum of ranks in group i.

<br>

⑸ **Step 4.** Apply H to the chi-squared test (however, degrees of freedom n-1 = 3)

> ① H asymptotically follows the chi-squared distribution.

> ② Degrees of freedom: the number of groups (J) − 1. That is, in the example above, the degrees of freedom are 4 − 1 = 3.

> ③ Each group follows χ<sup>2</sup>(1), and due to the constraint imposed by the total sum, the degrees of freedom for the chi-squared test become J−1.

⑹ Rejection region for significance level α

> ① If H ≥ h(α, k, (1, 2, ∙∙∙, m)), then reject H0

> ② h(α, k, (1, 2, ∙∙∙, m)) is the upper 100α percentile of H satisfying P(H ≥ h(α, k, (1, 2, ∙∙∙, m)))
