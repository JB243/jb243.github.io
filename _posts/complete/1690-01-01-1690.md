## **1\. Example**

**Figure. 1.** Example

<br>

 ⑴ Such a table as above is called a contingency table

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Explanation**

 ⑴ Premise **:** Marginal totals are known

> ① Marginal total **:** Refers to a + b, c + d, a + c, b + d

> ② It is also known that a + b + c + d = n

 ⑵ Null Hypothesis H0 **:** Male and female groups are the same group

 ⑶ Modification of Null Hypothesis **:** Male group is just a group randomly selected from a + c individuals out of n people

 ⑷ **Statistic 1.** Probability (Probability of coming out like the sample) **:** The probability that a of the randomly selected a + c individuals are studying

<br>

> ① Denominator **:** The case of randomly selecting a + c individuals out of n

> ② Numerator **:** Among n people, a + c are men, and a + b are studying (given), the case where a men are studying

> ③ The above calculation shows the same formula as the [hypergeometric distribution](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1626)

 ⑸ **Statistic 2.** Odds Ratio **:** A measure showing whether given male and female groups are similar or dissimilar

<br>

<br>

> ① Sometimes expressed as - log (odds ratio)

> ② Concept similar to fold change in genetic group analysis

> ③ ③ An odds ratio of 1 means that the two groups are very similar.

⑹ **Statistic 3.** Ratio **:** Generally represents a / (a+c)

⑺ **Statistic 4.** Count **:** Usually represents a, the number of elements in the intersection of the given two sets

⑻ **Statistic 5.** p-value: The probability of obtaining a p-value equal to or smaller (i.e., more extreme) than the given probability p. 

⑼ If the calculated p-value is very small

> ① The act of selecting the male group out of n people is not a random selection

> ② In other words, the male and female groups are different groups

>> ○ 'Different' means that the ratio of men and women in the act of studying is significantly different

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Application**

 ⑴ Impact of sample size

> ① Can be used regardless of sample size

> ② Generally used when the sample size is small

>> ○ In cases of large sample size, [chi-squared test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1727) is generally used

>> ○ Due to the size of factorial calculations, Fisher exact test is usually used when the sample size is small

>> ○ However, the size of factorial calculations can be circumvented by logarithmic calculations

> ③ However, if the p-value is too small, only Fisher's exact test is used

>> ○ [Chi-squared test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1727) is based on approximation, so it always outputs 0 in this case

 ⑵ Can also be used to test the similarity or identity of two sets

 **Figure. 2.** Testing the similarity of two sets using Fisher's exact test

<br>

> ① 'Studying' in **Figure. 1.** corresponds to Set A in **Figure. 2.** and 'Men' corresponds to Set B

 ⑶ Implementation in R

```python
my.Fisher.exact.test <- function(total, A, B, cross){
  a1 <- log10_factorial(A)
  a2 <- log10_factorial(total - A)
  a3 <- log10_factorial(B)
  a4 <- log10_factorial(total - B)

  b1 <- log10_factorial(cross)
  b2 <- log10_factorial(A - cross)
  b3 <- log10_factorial(B - cross)
  b4 <- log10_factorial(total - cross - (A - cross) - (B - cross))
  b5 <- log10_factorial(total)

  out = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 - b1 - b2 - b3 - b4 - b5
  return(10^out)
}
```
