## 1. Overview 

⑴ Purpose

> ① Large-scale quantitative culture of cells

> ② Mass production of cell-derived substances

>> ○ From animal cells: vaccines, antibodies, enzymes, hormones

>> ○ From plant cells: pharmaceuticals, food additives, flavors, pesticides, plant hormones, enzymes

⑵ Animal Cells

> ① Size of animal cells: diameter 10–30 µm

> ② Proliferation of animal cells: doubling time of ~10–50 hours

> ③ Waste products of animal cells: ammonium, lactic acid

> ④ Mostly adherent cells.

⑶ Terminology

> ① Cell line: the cells with which culture was first initiated

> ② Passage number: the number of times subculture has been performed

>> ○ Stem cells: a passage number of 4–8 is appropriate

>> ○ Cancer cells: no limit on passage number

> ③ Generation number: the number of times the cells have divided

> ④ Split ratio: into how many portions the culture is divided during subculture

> ⑤ Relationship between generation number and passage number

>> N<sub>total</sub> = 2<sup>(Generation Number)</sup> × N<sub>0</sub> = (Split Ratio)<sup>(Passage Number)</sup> × N<sub>0</sub>

>> ∴ Generation Number = Passage Number × log(Split Ratio) / log(2)

>> cf. log(Split Ratio) / log(2) ≈ (Split Ratio) / 2 for (Split Ratio) = 2, 3, 4, 5

>> ∴ Generation Number = Passage Number × (Split Ratio) / 2

⑷ Factors

> ① <b>Factor 1.</b> Support material

>> ○ As most cells are adherent: the surface-area-to-volume ratio of the support should be high.

> ② <b>Factor 2.</b> Mass transfer

> ③ <b>Factor 2-1.</b> Control of external environmental conditions: temperature, pH, DO, nutrients, redox potential, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration

>> ○ Temperature: 37 ± 0.2 °C; narrow acceptable range, particularly sensitive to high temperatures.

>> ○ pH: tends to rise early in culture; as cells proliferate, lactic acid accumulates and pH decreases.

>> ○ Dissolved oxygen (DO)

>>> ○ DO decreases as metabolism proceeds.

>>> ○ High DO can be cytotoxic

>>> ○ When DO is low: sparge with oxygen gas

>>> ○ When DO is high: sparge with nitrogen gas

>> ○ Nutrients: supply continuously via medium exchange

>>> ○ <b>Mode 1.</b> Batch culture

>>> ○ <b>Mode 2.</b> Continuous culture

>> ○ Aeration: use aeration methods that maximize oxygen transfer

> ④ <b>Factor 2-2.</b> Minimize accumulation of toxic metabolites such as lactic acid and ammonium.

> ⑤ <b>Factor 3.</b> Mechanical stimulation

>> ○ Minimize agitation speed to reduce mechanical damage to cells.

## 2. Types of Animal Cell Culture

⑴ Types of liquid culture: surface culture, deep (submerged) culture, dialysis culture

⑵ Liquid culture, suspension cells

> ① <b>Method 1.</b> Stirrer flask

>> ○ Minimize stirring speed to reduce shear stress on cells.

> ② <b>Method 2.</b> Biostat

>> ○ Supplies fresh medium and removes products to maintain constant conditions.

> ③ <b>Method 3.</b> Mixing &amp; aeration

> ④ <b>Method 4.</b> Rotating chamber

>> ○ <b>Component 1.</b> Cell chamber: where cells accumulate

>> ○ <b>Component 2.</b> Semipermeable membrane

>> ○ <b>Component 3.</b> Sampling port: outlet for cell products

> ⑤ <b>Method 5.</b> Hollow fiber

> ⑥ <b>Method 6.</b> Perfused suspension culture

>> ○ <b>Definition:</b> a system in which cells are confined to narrow compartments along the periphery of hollow fibers; fresh medium is perfused (flow-through) and spent medium is discharged along the tubes.

>> ○ <b>Advantages:</b> markedly improves cell proliferation; induces multilayering.

> ⑦ <b>Method 7.</b> NASA bioreactor

>> ○ <b>Definition:</b> a rotating culture that creates a simulated microgravity environment for cell growth

>> ○ <b>Advantages:</b> minimal physical damage due to microgravity conditions

>> ○ When rotation stops, cells settle, allowing medium exchange.

⑶ Liquid culture, adherent cells

> ① <b>Method 1.</b> Nunc Cell Factory

>> ○ Stacked rectangular Petri-dish-like units

> ② <b>Method 2.</b> Flask

>> ○ <b>Drawback:</b> only one side of the total surface area is utilized.

> ③ <b>Method 3.</b> Roller bottle

>> ○ <b>Advantage:</b> can utilize nearly the entire surface area.

> ④ <b>Method 4.</b> Microcarrier

>> ○ <b>Definition:</b> culture method in which cells are grown attached to microbeads.

>> ○ Microbead size: 90–300 µm

>> ○ Packed-bed bioreactor: microbeads are immobilized.

>> ○ Fluidized-bed bioreactor: microbeads are in motion.

> ⑤ <b>Method 5.</b> Ceramic matrix

> ⑥ <b>Method 6.</b> Multi-tray

>> ○ <b>Feature:</b> typically composed of 10 chambers.

> ⑦ <b>Method 7.</b> Plastic film

>> ○ <b>Definition:</b> cells are cultured within a film.

>> ○ Film materials: PET–Teflon (fluoroethylene propylene)

> ⑧ <b>Method 8.</b> Heli-cell

>> ○ <b>Definition:</b> cells are cultured on a helical ribbon.

>> ○ Uses polystyrene formed into twisted ribbons as packing material.

> ⑨ <b>Method 9.</b> Stack plate

>> ○ <b>Drawback:</b> higher medium-volume-to-surface-area ratio.

⑷ Solid-state culture

> ① <b>Definition:</b> cells are cultured directly on the surface of a medium containing appropriate moisture.

> ② <b>Examples:</b> mushroom cultivation, compost fermentation, production of fermented soybean products

## 3. Cell Immobilization 

⑴ <b>Definition:</b> fixing adherent cells in place

⑵ Advantages

> ① Promotes cell proliferation.

> ② Increased stability enables long-term culture.

> ③ Enables suspension culture of adherent cells: increases surface area per unit volume; mimics 3-D tissue.

> ④ Protects from shear stress.

> ⑤ Surface treatment can obviate the need for continuous addition of growth factors.

⑶ <b>Type 1.</b> Use of particulate carriers: cells are attached to carrier surfaces for culture.

> ① <b>Advantages:</b> increased surface area; more uniform growth environment

⑷ <b>Type 2.</b> Microencapsulation: cells are enclosed within capsule membranes.

> ① The capsule has a defined molecular weight cutoff.

> ② <b>Advantages:</b> prevents immune-cell infiltration; protects from shear stress.

> ③ <b>Drawbacks:</b> limits diffusion of dissolved oxygen and nutrients.

## 4. History of Cell Culture 

⑴ Mid-19th century: Pasteur proposed fermentation by microorganisms.

⑵ 1870s: Koch proposed heat sterilization methods

⑶ 1933: Kluyver proposed suspension culture using flasks.

⑷ 1940: Submerged culture methods were used for mass production of penicillin during World War II.
