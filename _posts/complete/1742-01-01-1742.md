## 1. Overview

⑴ Maximum, Minimum, Range

> ① Maximum: the largest value

> ② Minimum: the smallest value

> ③ Range = Maximum - Minimum

> ④ Midrange = (Maximum + Minimum) / 2

⑵ Quantile

> ① Quantile function: the inverse of the cumulative distribution function Φ

>> ○ Domain: {x | 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}

>> ○ Range: the statistic of the population of interest

> ② Depending on the number of intervals, there are percentiles (100 quantiles), quartiles (4 quantiles), etc.

> ③ Median: 50th percentile

> ④ First quartile: 25th percentile, that is, the 25th smallest number out of 100

> ⑤ Third quartile: 75th percentile, that is, the 75th smallest number out of 100 (or the 25th largest number)

⑴ Definition: a set of points (x, y) as follows 

> ① <span>｛(x, y) | Φ = P(X ＜ x) = P(Y ＜ y)｝</span>

> ② note that x is the statistic of the standard normal distribution and y is the statistic of the sample group 

⑵ Case study

> ① when the sample group follows a normal distribution**:** Q-Q plot is close to a straight line

> ② if the distribution of samples is skewed to the right 

>> ○ Skewness ＜ 0 

>> ○ idea: you can think of dragging each point to the right from the existing normal distribution

>> ○ since the random variable of each point increases, each point on the Q-Q plot moves upward from the diagonal

> ③ if the distribution of samples is skewed to the left 

>> ○ Skewness ＞ 0

>> ○ idea: you can think of dragging each point to the left from the existing normal distribution

>> ○ since the random variable of each point decreases, each point on the Q-Q plot moves downward from the diagonal
