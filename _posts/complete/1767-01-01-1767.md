## **1\. Definition**

 ⑴ A **:** Number of pentagons

 ⑵ B **:** Number of hexagons

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Application of Euler's Law**

 ⑴ For the number of vertices V, the number of edges E, and the number of facets F, the following holds true

 ⑵ Relationship for the number of vertices **:** Utilizing the fact that three facets meet at each vertex

 ⑶ Relationship for the number of edges **:** Utilizing the fact that two facets meet at each edge

 ⑷ Relationship for the number of facets

 ⑸ Application of Euler's Law

## **3\. Using Additional Information**

 ⑴ Additional information

> ① Each of the three sides of any hexagon is adjacent to a hexagon, while the remaining three sides are adjacent to a pentagon.

> ② All sides of any pentagon are adjacent to hexagons.

 ⑵ Calculation strategy

> ① (Counting from the perspective of hexagons, allowing for duplicates) Number of pentagons counted from the hexagon's perspective ÷ Overlap count = Number of pentagons = 12

> ② Overlap count = 5 ( **∵** Counted once from each of the five adjacent hexagons from the pentagon's perspective)

> ③ Calculation process
