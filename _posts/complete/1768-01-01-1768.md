## **1. Overview **

 ⑴ Problems in regression analysis: Mainly prominent when there are many regression variables

> ① [Multicollinearity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1632)

> ② **Underfitting**: The model lacks flexibility and cannot properly learn the given data

> ③ **Overfitting**

>> ○ In standard regression like OLS estimation, the model learns the noise in the sample, reducing predictive power

>> ○ Learning the bias during training can actually improve predictive power

 ⑵ Regularization (penalization)

> ① To solve regression problems, a penalty term is added to the parameters

> ② Note that not applying regularization causes overfitting, while too much causes underfitting

> ③ Standardization of data must be performed

>> ○ Features with large values have large coefficients, which may be overly penalized and shrink too much

>> ○ Conversely, features with small values have small coefficients and may be under-penalized

> ④ Sometimes includes a process of optimizing parameters (e.g. penalty term weight) using a validation set

> ⑤ Expected results of regularization

##  **2. MSPE** 

⑴ Overview

> ① Error: Assuming **e** is squared error, h is hypothesis, and f is true function

> ② **Type 1.** In-sample error: Also called training error. Similar to bias

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4154696-e199-4aac-acba-0ef2ca6d7b92)

<br>

> ③ **Type 2.** Out-of-sample error: Also called generalization error, MSPE. Similar to variance

<br>

<br>

>> ○ **Step 1.** Build prediction model using given sample

>> ○ **Step 2.** Compare predicted and actual values using data outside the sample (XOOS, YOOS)

>> ○ Note: ŷ refers to prediction obtained using in-sample data

> ④ (Reference) [bias-variance tradeoff](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1630)

> ⑤ Best prediction quantity: Called oracle predictor. E(YOOS | XOOS)

>> ○ Prediction error in MSPE is as follows

>> ○ Fundamental error: Cannot be improved. YOOS \- E(YOOS | XOOS)

>> ○ Estimation error: Ŷ(XOOS) - E(YOOS | XOOS)

⑵ MSPE estimator

> ① If β is known, MSPE = σu2 holds

> ② k/n may be large

 ⑶ Assumptions

> ① **Assumption 1.** No multicollinearity

> ② **Assumption 2.** (XOOS, YOOS) are randomly drawn from the same population

 ⑷ Transformations

> ① Standardization

>> ○ (Xi1*, ···, Xki*, Yi*) are values extracted from original sample

>> ○ Define Xji as (Xji* - μXj*) / σXj*

>> ○ Dependent variable is transformed as Yσj ← Yσj \- μY*

> ② Principle of shrinkage

<br>

<br>

>> ○ Can reduce MSPE

>> ○ Bias occurs instead: Tradeoff

>> ○ Most famous example is James-Stein estimator

 ⑸ In-sample MSPE calculation: m-fold cross validation is commonly used

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Split given sample into m parts

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Use m-1 parts to estimate parameters: Training data

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Use the remaining part to evaluate performance: Testing data

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Repeat m times with different combinations

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Take average to determine final estimator

<br>

> ⑥ Typically 10-fold cross validation is used

 ⑹ Out-of-sample root MSPE calculation

> ① Use model trained on in-sample data to evaluate performance on different sample

> ② This different sample is called validation set

<br>

<br>

## **3. Technique 1.** Ridge regression

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Penalizes squared values to control model complexity. Penalty is a function of weights

> ② Also called L2 regularization

> ③ Introduced in 1962 by A. E. Hoerl to solve non-invertibility of the regression matrix

 ⑸ Characteristics of Ridge regression solution

> ① Even without invertible XtX, λ allows calculation of inverse

> ② Each λ gives one estimator

> ③ λ → 0: **Overfitting**. Reaches linear regression (OLS) solution

> ④ λ → ∞: **Underfitting**. Coefficients w approach 0 (**∵** penalty on large coefficients)

**Figure 6.** Square root of MSPE according to λ<sub>Lasso</sub>

<br>

> ① λ<sub>Lasso</sub> is calculated via cross validation

> ② Unlike Ridge, no general closed-form solution

 ⑷ Characteristics

> ① Useful when model has sparsity property: i.e., many coefficients are 0

> ② λ → 0: Reaches linear regression (OLS) solution. Best in-sample but poor out-of-sample

> ③ λ → ∞: Coefficients w approach 0 (**∵** penalty on large coefficients)

 ⑸ **Application 1.** Principle of **sparsity**

> ① Laplace prior sets unimportant variables exactly to 0: Effectively removes unimportant **variables**

 **Figure 8.** Intuitive understanding of Lasso regression's sparsity

<br>

>> ○ Red ellipses connect points of equal MSE (mean squared error)

>> ○ Blue region connects points with equal penalty

>> ○ As λ increases, penalty increases, both Lasso and Ridge shrink

>> ○ In Ridge, optimum occurs at point where red ellipse touches circular blue region: If not, solution lies nearer to origin with smaller penalty

>> ○ In Lasso, if blue region is small, optimal solution occurs at point where some coefficients are 0: At this sharp point, movement along edge exits red ellipse (→ higher MSE)

>> ○ Unlike Ridge, Lasso induces sparsity

 ⑹ **Application 2.** Comparison with other methods

##  **5. Technique 3.** Elastic Net

 ⑴ A linear combination of lasso and ridge. Adds both sum of absolute values and squared values of weights as penalty terms

<br>

<img width="545" alt="스크린샷 2025-06-08 오전 11 32 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aee984e-b49e-4c29-bb7e-36ebc8d8919a" />

<br>

 ⑵ **Parameter 1.** Alpha (α): Controls mix ratio of L1 and L2 penalties. α = 1 is Lasso, α = 0 is Ridge

 ⑶ **Parameter 2.** Lambda (λ): Controls strength of penalty. Multiplies the entire regularization term

<br>

<br>

## **6. Technique 4.** SelectFromModel

 ⑴ A method for selecting variables based on [decision tree](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2161) algorithms
