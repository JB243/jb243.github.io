⑶ table of F statistic

| factor | sum of squares | df | mean square | F | significance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Regression | 539.648 | 1 | 539.648 | 49.086 | < 0.001 |

| Total | 627.600 | 9 |   |   |   |

<b>Table 3.</b> table of F statistic

<br>

> ① null hypothesis H0 **:** the slope of the regression line is equal to zero 

> ② idea **:** if MS of regression ＞ MS of residual, the slope of the regression line is not zero 

> ③ calculation

<br>

> ④ the reason why the degree of freedom of the regression line is 1**:** because there is only one regression variable

⑷ the reason why F statistic shows greater power than t statistic **:** p value of F statistic is smaller 

> ① F statistic uses more information than t statistic

> ② F statistics shows greater power due to the effect of larger sample sizes

<br>

<br>

## **2\. ANCOVA**

⑴ overview

> ① concept of fusing simple linear regression analysis with one-way ANOVA

> ② necessity **:** in actual problem situations, the second factor changes due to the confounding effect of one factor, which can affect the dependent variable

> ③ difference from two-way ANOVA**:** ANCOVA technique does not compete with certain ANOVA techniques. ANOVA and ANCOVA can be performed at the same time

⑵ problem situation

> ① independent variable**:** whether it is a contaminated mine area or not

> ② dependent variable**:** lead concentration in organs of the rats  

> ③ confounding effect**:** age

⑶ table of results without considering age

<br>

| factor | sum of squares | degree of freedom | mean square | F ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Treatment | SS Treatment | k-1 | MS Treatment = SS Treatment / (k-1) | F = MS Treament / MS Error |
| Error | SS Error | N-k | MS Error = SS Error / (N-k) |   |
| Sum | SS Total | N-1 |   |   |

<b>Table 4.</b> table of results of simple one-way ANOVA 

<br>

> ① if the age effect is not controlled, the residuals become larger

> ② as the residuals increase, MS Error increases and F ratio decreases

> ③ as F ratio decreases, the power decreases**:** in other words, it is difficult to prove the significance of the treatment

⑷ assumptions

> ① homoscedasticity

> ② independency

> ③ normality

> ④ the relationship between a covariate and the dependent variable should be linear

> ⑤ parallelism

>> ○ for example, when calculating the regression line for each contaminated mining area and non-contaminated area, the slopes will be the same

>> ○ satisfying parallelism means the same thing as no interaction 

>> ○ if parallelism is not satisfied, comparing differences for one selected value (e.g., the overall mean of age) cannot represent the entire range of covariatess

<b>Figure 1.</b> example of lack of parallelism in ANCOVA

>> ○ before ANCOVA, the interaction of age and region should be evaluated to confirm parallelism

⑸ procedure

<br>

| factor | sum of squares | degree of freedom | mean square | F ratio | p value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Age | 1776.290 | 1 | 1776.290 | 93.054 | < 0.001 |
| Site | 1094.335 | 1 | 1094.335 | 57.329 | < 0.001 |
| Error | 324.510 | 17 | 19.089 |   |   |
| Total | 2420.800 | 19 |   |   |   |

<b>Table 7.</b> table of results after correction

<br>

> ④ report example **:** "A preliminary analysis for parallelism showed no significant difference between the slopes of the lines for lead concentration in relation to age (age × site**:** F<sub>1,16</sub> = 0.00, NS). The subsequent ANCOVA showed a significant effect of site (F<sub>1,17</sub> = 57.329, P < 0.001) as well as a significant effect of the covariate (age) (F<sub>1,17</sub> = 93.054, P < 0.001). Rats from the mine site had higher levels of lead than those from the control.

⑺ the reason for not comparing the y-intercept of the regression line in the contaminated mine area with that of the regression line in the other area

> ① situation **:** if parallelism is satisfied, it is much easier to compare the y-intercepts 

> ② comparing y-intercepts is similar to comparing sample groups **with only one sample**

> ③ because ANCOVA takes the total error terms, ANCOVA is similar to comparing sample groups with **twice as many elements as the size of the given sample group** 

> ④ therefore, performing ANCOVA has higher power than simply comparing y-intercepts

⑻ **application 1.** 2-factor ANCOVA 

> ① applying the ANCOVA technique when analyzing 2-way ANOVA

> ② example**:** when the independent variables are gender and drug treatment, the dependent variable is blood pressure, and the confounding factor is age  

⑼ **application 2.** if there are multiple confounding factors  

> ① multiple linear regression analysis is used 

> ② [advanced regression analysis](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1792) may also be used
