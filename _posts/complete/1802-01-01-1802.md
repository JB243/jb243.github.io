## **1. Convergence of sequences and basic properties**

⑴ What it means for a real sequence (a<sub>n</sub>)<sub>n∈ℕ</sub> to converge to a real number a

> ① For N ∈ ℕ, for all n ＞ N

> ② For every positive ε, **there exists** an N such that eventually ㅣ a<sub>n</sub> - a ㅣ ＜ ε

⑵ Given a sequence (a<sub>n</sub>) and an increasing sequence of natural numbers n<sub>1</sub> ＜ n<sub>2</sub> ＜ ···, the new sequence (a<sub>n<sub>k</sub></sub>)<sub>k∈ℕ</sub> is called a **subsequence** of (a<sub>n</sub>).

⑶ **Exercise:** Prove the following.

> ① If eventually a<sub>n</sub> = a, then (a<sub>n</sub>) converges to a.

> ② If (a<sub>n</sub>) converges to a, then the set {a<sub>n</sub>} is bounded.

> ③ Suppose (a<sub>n</sub>) → a and (b<sub>n</sub>) → b. If eventually a<sub>n</sub> ≤ b<sub>n</sub>, show that a ≤ b.

> ④ If (a<sub>n</sub>) → a and eventually a<sub>n</sub> ≤ b, then a ≤ b.

> ⑤ If (a<sub>n</sub>) → a and also (a<sub>n</sub>) → b, then a = b. That is, the limit of a convergent sequence is unique.

<br>

⑹ **Exercise:** Prove the following.

> ① The sequence (a<sub>n</sub>) = (1, 0, 1, 0, ···) does not converge.

> ② If a is the limit of (a<sub>n</sub>) and b is the limit of (b<sub>n</sub>) show that the following holds.

<br>

⑺ **Exercise:** Prove the following.

> ① Convergence of increasing sequences: If a<sub>1</sub> ≤ a<sub>2</sub> ≤ ··· and (a<sub>n</sub>) is bounded, show that (a<sub>n</sub>) converges. Can you reach the same conclusion for decreasing sequences?

> ② Let two sequences (a<sub>n</sub>) and (b<sub>n</sub>) satisfy a<sub>1</sub> = 1, b<sub>1</sub> = 2 and

<br>

<img width="117" height="35" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 47 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c847096d-3dce-4f65-8733-dda9e3732ea6" />

<br>

> holds. Show that both sequences converge.

⑻ **Exercise:** Let the sequence (a<sub>n</sub>) have a<sub>1</sub> = 3 and for each n ∈ ℕ, define

<br>

<img width="147" height="46" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 49 16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0923166f-3b60-4d0e-b7a9-247af0d07c94" />

<br>

Show that (a<sub>n</sub>) converges. To what does it converge?

<br>

<br>

## **2. Cauchy sequences** 

⑴ Definition of a Cauchy sequence

> ① For N ∈ ℕ, for all n, m ＞ N

> ② A real sequence (a<sub>n</sub>) is a Cauchy sequence if for every ε ＞ 0, **there exists** an N such that eventually ㅣ a<sub>n</sub> - a<sub>m</sub> ㅣ ＜ ε

⑵ For a vector sequence ((a<sub>n</sub>, b<sub>n</sub>))<sub>n∈ℕ</sub> in ℝ<sup>2</sup> to converge to the vector (a, b) is the same as

<br>

<img width="106" height="37" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 50 27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1149dc0-e6b0-4e58-bd89-41cdb492ac96" />

<br>

and

<br>

<img width="106" height="37" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 50 38" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f847e3fb-af22-439c-9013-400e85277eed" />

<br>

respectively.

⑶ Define the infinite series I as follows:

<br>

<img width="92" height="53" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 51 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76a34b8f-c0d9-4c87-9862-13de34c5ea29" />

<br>

For a real sequence (a<sub>n</sub>), saying that the infinite series I converges to A means that the sequence of partial sums (A<sub>n</sub>) converges to A. Here A<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + ··· + a<sub>n</sub>.

⑷ Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem: If a real sequence (a<sub>n</sub>) is bounded, it has a convergent subsequence. Can we say the same for ((a<sub>n</sub>, b<sub>n</sub>))<sub>n∈ℕ</sub>?

⑸ **Exercise:** Show that if (a<sub>n</sub>) is a Cauchy sequence, then it converges.

⑹ **Exercise:** If

<br>

<img width="138" height="53" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 52 41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2af47e4-eca0-495e-8b27-4a4242e6f9e6" />

<br>

then

<br>

<img width="107" height="35" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 53 04" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ec78999-f2be-47e2-a1ec-810607469bc4" />

<br>

holds. Prove this.

⑺ **Exercise:** Find an example where the limit of (a<sub>n</sub>) is 0 but the infinite series I does not exist.

⑻ **Exercise:** For a real r, exactly when does the geometric series

<br>

<img width="54" height="56" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 54 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4482c15f-85c3-4e8f-af89-682f4ab5c547" />

<br>

converge?

⑼ **Exercise:** Let a real sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, ··· satisfy a<sub>n</sub> ≥ 0 for each n. Show that the infinite series

<br>

<img width="54" height="56" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 54 33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/487d45c3-b49d-4b60-a3e4-8ad895ade6f7" />

<br>

converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums (A<sub>n</sub>) is bounded.

⑽ **Exercise:** If the infinite series

<br>

<img width="115" height="55" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 55 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebbce82-9391-40cb-84ef-ac623fb3df9a" />

<br>

converges, prove that the infinite series

<br>

<img width="120" height="55" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 55 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0810ed1-2c1c-410d-ac87-4ee93d815466" />

<br>

also converges.

⑾ **Exercise:** Let the sequence (a<sub>n</sub>) be defined by a<sub>1</sub> = 1 and for each n ∈ ℕ, define

<br>

<img width="131" height="51" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 56 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19c3727-572e-4660-9400-44b32f19c335" />

<br>

Show that (a<sub>n</sub>) converges. To what does it converge? Can this limit be expressed as a continued fraction?

> **○ Solution**

>> By mathematical induction, a<sub>2n</sub> and a<sub>2n-1</sub> can be shown to be increasing sequences.

>> Also, since a<sub>n</sub> ＜ 2, the sequence (a<sub>n</sub>) is bounded above.

>> An increasing and bounded sequence converges; hence (a<sub>2n</sub>), (a<sub>2n-1</sub>) converge.

>> As will be seen in the next steps, the limits of (a<sub>2n</sub>) and (a<sub>2n-1</sub>) are the same, so (a<sub>n</sub>) converges.

>> Let a be the limit of (a<sub>n</sub>); then we have the following.

<br>

<br>

>> The continued-fraction representation is as follows.

## **3. Example: optimal stopping and Cauchy sequences**

⑴ **Theorem 1.** If V<sub>t</sub>(i) = max{r(i), a + b∑<sub>j∈S</sub> ℙ(j ㅣ i) V<sub>t+1</sub>(j)} = max{r(i), a + b𝔼[V<sub>t+1</sub>(j) ㅣ i]}, then V<sub>t</sub>(i) ≥ V<sub>t+1</sub>(i) holds

> **Proof 1.** Algebraic proof: Use [mathematical induction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9RBuyBmFdQ) (backward induction)

<br>

<img width="558" height="376" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 12 59 21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38875cac-595b-4eff-a0af-5baba6223747" />

<br>

> **Proof 2.** Combinatorial proof: Similarly use mathematical induction. In a backward induction setting, if V<sub>τ</sub>(i) ≥ V<sub>τ+1</sub>(i) holds for τ = t+1, ..., T-1 while a repetitive pattern recurs at each τ, then if we forcibly pick “status quo” at any single step along the trajectory from V<sub>t</sub>(·) → V<sub>T</sub>(·), the evolution can be made completely identical to the trajectory from V<sub>t+1</sub>(·) → V<sub>T</sub>(·). Therefore V<sub>τ</sub>(i) ≥ V<sub>τ+1</sub>(i) also holds at τ = t.

> **Note.** The fact that it is a max is not essential. Even if it is defined with an inf in the next example, adding an extra stage gives a chance to add a nonnegative cost, so minimization cannot make the value go down. That is, V<sub>n</sub>(i) ≤ V<sub>n+1</sub>(i) (forward induction)

<br>

<img width="382" height="91" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 1 00 43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf61be4a-d285-40f4-a2dc-a228a9694b6f" />

<br>

⑵ **Theorem 2.** If V<sub>t</sub>(x) = max{-c + p(x)(1 + V<sub>t+1</sub>(x-1)) + (1 - p(x))V<sub>t+1</sub>(x), V<sub>t+1</sub>(x)}, V<sub>N+1</sub>(x) = 0, then the following hold

> ① **Monotonicity in time**: V<sub>t</sub>(x) ≥ V<sub>t+1</sub>(x)

>> **Proof**

>>> V<sub>t</sub>(x) = max{·, V<sub>t+1</sub>(x)} ≥ V<sub>t+1</sub>(x)

> ② **Monotonicity in x**: V<sub>t</sub>(x) ≥ V<sub>t</sub>(x-1)

>> **Proof**

>>> Consider the grid formed by (t, x).

>>> Check that at x = 0 we have V<sub>t</sub>(x) = V<sub>t+1</sub>(x) for all t.

>>> In the order (t, x) = (N+1, 0), ⋯, (N+1, S), (N, 0), ⋯, (N, S), (N-1, 0), ⋯ we can verify that the above inductive hypothesis is preserved.

>>> (If S = ∞, traverse along the diagonal.)

>>> That is, at each induction step we can find A, B, C, D such that A ≤ B, C ≤ D, and V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) = max(A, C) ≤ max(B, D) = V<sub>t</sub>(x).

>>> For example, B = -c + p(x)(1 + V<sub>t+1</sub>(x-1)) + (1 - p(x))V<sub>t+1</sub>(x).

<br>

<img width="498" height="161" alt="스크린샷 2025-11-09 오전 1 03 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8c3271-5b1f-499e-9713-71a1459c3a7c" />

<br>

> ③ **Upper bound on marginal value:** 1 ≥ V<sub>t</sub>(x) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-1)

>> **Proof**

>>> Consider running the world with initial particle count x (A) and the world with x-1 (B) under the same action sequence (the same “look/skip” each day).

>>> If there really exists a point where V<sub>t</sub>(x) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) > 1, then simply “replicating and executing” that policy in both worlds (with no other device) would create a stable excess profit for A over B exceeding 1.

>>> Repeating such replication infinitely would imply the possibility of creating unbounded profit, which contradicts many rules of this world such as symmetry.

>>> Therefore that profit gap can never exceed 1.

>>> Hence such a point does not exist.

>> **Intuition**

>>> Intuitively, expected gain cannot exceed sure gain, so V<sub>t</sub>(x) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) must be ≤ the sure gain 1.

>> **Intuition**

>>> In practice, when you simulate V<sub>t</sub>(x), it does not show a wildly oscillating shape. (**∵** ⑥ **Existence of a threshold**)

>>> In fact, by ⑤ **Time relation of marginal value**, V<sub>t</sub>(x) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) is monotone in time.

>>> A bounded monotone sequence converges by the completeness axiom.

>>> And by symmetry the limit must be exactly 1, neither larger nor smaller than 1.

> ④ **Failure of concavity in x:** V<sub>t</sub>(x) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) ≤ V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-2)

>> **Counterexample**

>>> In all three of the following situations, concavity in x failed.

<br>

> ⑤ **Time relation of marginal value:** V<sub>t</sub>(x) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) ≥ V<sub>t+1</sub>(x) - V<sub>t+1</sub>(x-1)

>> **Proof.** Mimicking policy

>>> We say that the marginal value of one extra particle, ΔV<sub>τ</sub>(x) = V<sub>τ</sub>(x) - V<sub>τ</sub>(x-1), decreases as the remaining horizon shrinks.

>>> From ② **Monotonicity in x**, we know ΔV<sub>τ</sub> ≥ 0.

>>> Suppose there are two worlds, one at time t (A) and one at time t+1 (B).

>>> If we force A to wait one step and then run the same action sequence as B (the same “look/skip” each day), we can obtain the same marginal value.

>>> But A has one more day of freedom than B, so it can choose actions that make V<sub>t</sub>(x) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) sufficiently larger.

>>> Therefore V<sub>t</sub>(x) - V<sub>t</sub>(x-1) ≥ V<sub>t+1</sub>(x) - V<sub>t+1</sub>(x-1).

>> **Significance**

>>> From ①, ②, ③, and ⑤, we can easily prove S<sub>k</sub> = {x ㅣ c ≥ p(x)(1 + V<sub>k+1</sub>(x-1) - V<sub>k+1</sub>(x))}, and S<sub>k</sub> ⊃ S<sub>k+1</sub>.

>>> For reference, S<sub>k</sub> is the set of x values where the value function does not change on day k, i.e., where “stay” is chosen.

> ⑥ **Existence of a threshold**: G<sub>t</sub>(x) = p(x)(1 - Δ<sub>t+1</sub>(x)) is a monotone increasing function of x

>> **Proof.**

>>> Let S<sub>k</sub> = {x ㅣ c ≥ p(x)(1 - Δ<sub>k+1</sub>(x))} = {x ㅣ c ≥ G<sub>t</sub>(x)}.

>>> When t = N we know G<sub>t</sub>(x) = p(x), which is a monotone increasing function of x.

>>> Consider the grid formed by (t, x).

>>> In the order (t, x) = (N+1, 0), ⋯, (N+1, S), (N, 0), ⋯, (N, S), (N-1, 0), ⋯, verify that the above inductive hypothesis is preserved.

>>> (If S = ∞, traverse along the diagonal.)

>>> Suppose that for t+1, ···, N we have verified that Sk can be written as {0, 1, ···, x<sub>k</sub>*}.

>>> If “stay” is chosen at (t+1, x), then there is no further gain from “look,” so at (t, x) we also choose “stay.”

>>> (Note that if you have plenty of time remaining, you can make greater use of the “stay” strategy.)

>>> If “look” is chosen at (t+1, x) and also at (t+1, x-1), then at (t, x) we can safely choose “look.”

>>> If “look” is chosen at (t+1, x) but “stay” at (t+1, x-1), then at (t, x) we may either wait briefly or choose “look.”

>>> Therefore even at time t we still have S<sub>k</sub> = {0, 1, ···, x<sub>k</sub>*}, and we have also checked the possibility that xt* ≥ xt+1*.

>>> Writing Sk as {0, 1, ···, x<sub>k</sub>*} inductively proves that G<sub>t</sub>(x) is monotone increasing.

>>> This explains why V<sub>t</sub>(x) does not exhibit a wildly oscillating shape.

>> **Proof.** Approach Using a Fixed Point

>>> Suppose we know that S<sub>k</sub> = {0, 1, ···, x<sub>k</sub><sup>*</sup>}.

>>> That is, x<sub>k</sub><sup>∗</sup> ​ is the unique fixed point of x = p<sup>-1</sup>(c / p(x)(1 - Δ<sub>k+1</sub>(x))).

>>> Since the right-hand side decreases as k increases, the fixed point becomes smaller. 

>>> Therefore, x<sub>t<sub><sup>∗</sup> ≥ x<sub>t+1</sub><sup>∗</sup> holds.
