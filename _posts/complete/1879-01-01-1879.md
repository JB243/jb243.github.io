## **1. Overview**

1) Goods **:** denoted by *x*, *y*  
2) Price **:** denoted by *p*  
3) Budget **:** denoted by *I*

## **2. Utility Function** (utility function)

1) Consumption bundle **:** a set of goods considered for consumption  
2) Utility **:** the satisfaction consumers expect to obtain when purchasing goods or services  
3) Preference **:** microeconomics assumes consumers consider utility over all feasible choices and then choose the best option  
4) Utility function (utility function)

> **(1) Definition**  
> - Total utility obtained by consuming a particular bundle among various bundles  
> - A function that provides a way to rank consumption bundles based on utility levels  
> - There are few restrictions on the choice of a utility function: we care only about which option is preferred, not by *how much*  
> - If you compose a utility function with a strictly increasing function, the resulting function can also serve as a utility function  
> - (Note) A representative example of a utility measure is monetary value converted under a currency system  

> **(2) Cardinal utility vs. ordinal utility**  
> - Cardinal utility: a utility function where concrete absolute values can be defined  
> - Ordinal utility: a utility function that cannot assign meaningful absolute values but can rank (compare) bundles  
> - Using ordinal utility is usually not a problem: the marginal rate of substitution does not require the utility function to be unique  

> **(3) Example 1.** Cobb–Douglas utility function  

> **(4) Marginal utility** (marginal utility): related to **uₓ** and **uᵧ**  
> - Definition: the additional utility gained from consuming one more unit of a particular good  

> **(5) Average utility** (average utility)  

5) Indifference curve **:** related to **y(x)** (because it can be separated in an implicit-function form)

> **(1) Definition**  
> - A curve representing combinations that yield the same utility for an individual (also called an equal-utility curve)  
> - An indifference curve can be viewed as a contour line of “height” given by utility  

> **(2) Properties**  
> - Property 1: indifference curves representing different utility levels cannot intersect  
> - Property 2: indifference curves slope downward (negative slope)  
>   - Reason: even if consumption of *x* decreases, increasing *y* appropriately can keep utility the same  
>   - This reflects that consumers can substitute one good for another to maintain a fixed level of satisfaction  

> **(3) Marginal rate of substitution (MRS)** (marginal rate of substitution): related to **-y′(x)**  
> - Definition: the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute one good for another while maintaining the same satisfaction  
> - Relationship to marginal utilities: the negative sign is used so that MRS is defined as a positive number  
> - Over an infinitesimal interval, if *x* decreases and *y* increases by MRS, utility remains constant  
> - Tip: MRS is proportional to dy/dx; since uₓ is inversely related to dx and uᵧ is inversely related to dy, the numerator/denominator take that form  
> - Law of diminishing MRS: as you move to the right along an indifference curve, MRS gradually decreases  

6) Convexity **:** related to **y″(x)** (convex to the origin; also described as “convex downward”)

> **(1) Intuitive definition**  
> - An “average” choice yields higher utility than an extreme choice  

> **(2) Mathematical definition**  
> - *y = y(x)* is convex downward. In fact, a “convex function” commonly refers to a function that is convex downward in this convention  
> - If MRS is a monotonically decreasing function, the indifference curve is convex (because MRS = -y′(x))  
> - Example 1: u(x, y) = max{x, y} is not convex  
> - Example 2: u(x, y) = min{x, y} is not convex  

> **(3) Law of diminishing marginal utility** (law of diminishing marginal utility) or diminishing marginal rate of substitution  
> - Definition: as consumption of a specific good increases, its marginal utility decreases (i.e., marginal utility is a decreasing function)  
> - In other words, as consumption of one good increases, the amount of the other good the consumer is willing to give up for one more unit decreases  
> - Reason: consumers prefer more balanced consumption bundles  
> - Example: after eating the first 100 g of beef, the additional satisfaction from eating another 100 g is relatively small

## **3. Marshallian Demand Function** (Marshallian demand function)

1) Assumption: *x* and *y* are types of goods; pₓ and pᵧ are their respective prices  
2) Budget constraint (budget constraint)

> **(1) Definition**  
> - Consumers cannot spend beyond their budget (income level)  
> - It is straightforward to see that when pₓx + pᵧy = I, utility u(x, y) is maximized at the optimal choice  

3) Utility maximization problem (utility maximization problem)

> **(1) Solution method**  
> - Solve using the [Lagrange multiplier method](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1813)  

> **(2) Example 1**  
> - Choose goods in quantities inversely proportional to their prices  

> **(3) Example 2**  
> - There is no interior maximum; when MRS is larger than pₓ / pᵧ, it is advantageous to **increase x**  

**Figure 1.** Indifference curves for Example 2

> - ⒜: tangent line to the utility function; the magnitude of the slope is MRS  
> - ⒝: set of (x, y) that keeps the budget constant; the magnitude of the slope is pₓ / pᵧ  
> - Interpretation 1: At ⒜, increasing x leaves unused budget, so it is advantageous  
> - Interpretation 2: At ⒝, increasing x moves to a higher indifference curve, so it is advantageous  
> - (Note) Since pₓ is in the numerator and pᵧ in the denominator, this corresponds to a situation where x is relatively cheap and y is relatively expensive  

> **(4) (Note) Corner solution**  
> - Solve the utility maximization problem under x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0  

> **(5) (Note) Interior solution**  
> - Solve the utility maximization problem under x > 0, y > 0  

4) Budget line (budget line)

> **(1) Definition**  
> - A graph of consumption bundles that can be chosen given a particular budget  
> - If the utility function is convex, utility is maximized at the point where the line pₓx + pᵧy = I is tangent to an indifference curve  

5) Marshallian demand function **:** refers to the solutions x(pₓ, pᵧ, I) and y(pₓ, pᵧ, I) to the utility maximization problem

> - (Note) In general, “demand function” refers to the Marshallian demand function  
> - Gross substitutes: when the price of another good rises, this good sells relatively better  
> - Gross complements: when the price of another good rises, the complementary good sells relatively worse  

6) Indirect utility function **:** the utility value evaluated at x(pₓ, pᵧ, I) and y(pₓ, pᵧ, I), i.e., the maximum utility under given prices and budget  

---

## **4. Hicksian Demand Function** (Hicksian demand function, compensated demand function)

1) Expenditure minimization problem (expenditure minimization problem)  
2) Hicksian demand function **:** refers to the solutions xᶜ(pₓ, pᵧ, k) and yᶜ(pₓ, pᵧ, k) to the expenditure minimization problem  
3) Expenditure function (expenditure function) **:** the minimum required budget to achieve a given preference (utility) level  

---

## **5. Demand Curve** (demand curve)

1) Demand curve

> **(1)** If we fix pᵧ and I, we can find a function x = x(pₓ)  

**Figure 2.** Price-consumption curve and demand curve

> **(2)** The graph of x = x(pₓ) is called the demand curve  
> **(3)** In general, x = x(pₓ) has an inverse function, so we can also find pₓ = pₓ(x)  
> **(4)** Change in quantity demanded: movement along the demand curve (a change in quantity)  
> **(5)** Change in demand: a change in consumption caused by a shift of the demand curve itself  
> **(6)** The original demand curve is typically downward sloping and convex to the origin, but there are exceptions  

**Figure 3.** Demand curves for perfect substitutes, perfect complements, and when one is a bad  

2) Changes in consumer choice

> **(1) Price effect** (price effect)  
> - Definition: the change in consumption when a good’s price changes  
> - **Price effect = substitution effect + income effect**  

> **(2) Substitution effect** (substitution effect)  
> - Definition: the change in consumption needed to maintain the same satisfaction as before a price change, while achieving that satisfaction at minimum cost after the price change  
> - The difference in demands between points on the same indifference curve  

> **(3) Income effect** (income effect)  
> - Also called the “real income effect”  
> - Definition: the change in consumption induced by the change in real income caused by the price change  
> - The difference in demands between points on different indifference curves when the price ratio pₓ/pᵧ is held constant  

> **(4) Formalization**

**Figure 4.** Diagram of substitution effect and income effect

> - Price effect: ● → ●  
> - Substitution effect: ● → ●  
> - Income effect: ● → ●  

> **(5) Special case 1: Giffen good** (e.g., potatoes)  
> - A special case of an inferior good: an inferior good for which the income effect is larger than the substitution effect  
> - The demand curve slopes upward  

> **(6) Special case 2: Network effect** (network effect)  
> - An individual’s demand is influenced by other people’s demand  
> - With network effects, the market demand curve cannot be obtained by simply summing individual demand curves horizontally  

> **(7) Special case 3: Bandwagon effect** (bandwagon effect)  
> - Purchasing something because it is fashionable  

> **(8) Special case 4: Snob effect** (snob effect)  
> - Demand decreases as the number of people consuming the good increases  
> - Example: luxury-brand consumption motivated by exclusivity  

3) Elasticity of demand

> **(1) Price elasticity of demand** (price elasticity of demand): related to the **price effect**  
> - Definition: a measure of how much the quantity demanded changes in response to a change in the good’s price  
>   - A negative sign is attached  
>   - Tip: among several demand curves that intersect at a point, the **steepest** one is the most inelastic  

> - Magnitude of price elasticity  
>   - Elastic (|ε| > 1): when price falls, P × Qd rises (necessary and sufficient condition)  
>   - Inelastic (|ε| < 1): when price falls, P × Qd falls (necessary and sufficient condition)  
>   - Unit elastic (|ε| = 1): total revenue is maximized; when price falls, P × Qd stays constant (necessary and sufficient condition)  
>   - (Note) “Elastic” means consumers can more easily forgo purchasing when the price rises  

> - Determinants of price elasticity  
>   - Luxury vs. necessity: luxuries are easier to give up → elasticity ↑  
>   - Availability of substitutes: more substitutes → elasticity ↑  
>   - Budget share: higher share → elasticity ↑  
>   - Market definition: narrower markets transmit information faster → elasticity ↑ (e.g., Coke vs. Pepsi)  
>   - Time horizon: in the long run, adaptation raises elasticity → elasticity ↑  

> - Example: illegal drugs in the U.S.  
>   - Demand for illegal drugs is inelastic  
>   - Supply suppression raises prices and thus increases suppliers’ revenues, which is undesirable  
>   - Demand-reduction policies (e.g., anti-drug campaigns) are more desirable  

> - (Note) If quantity demanded increases when price rises, price elasticity can be negative  
>   - Example 1: conspicuous consumption (luxury goods)  
>   - Example 2: Giffen goods  

> **(2) Income elasticity of demand** (income elasticity of demand): related to the **income effect**  
> - Definition: a measure of how much quantity demanded changes in response to a change in income  
>   - No negative sign is attached  
> - Normal vs. inferior goods  
>   - Engel curve: relationship between income and quantity demanded  
>   - Normal good: income elasticity > 0  
>   - Inferior good: income elasticity < 0 (e.g., staple foods)  
>   - Necessity: 0 < income elasticity < 1  
>   - Luxury: income elasticity > 1  

> **(3) Cross elasticity of demand** (cross elasticity of demand): related to the **substitution effect**  
> - Definition: a measure of how much the quantity demanded of one good changes when the price of another good changes  
>   - No negative sign is attached  
> - Substitute: cross elasticity is positive  
> - Complement: cross elasticity is negative  

4) Consumer surplus (consumer surplus)

> **(1) Definition**  
> - The integral of the difference between the demand curve and the price line pₓ = p₀, representing the value gained from obtaining good x  
> - In other words, it indicates the satisfaction consumers obtain when they purchase a good at a lower price  

> **(2) Note**  
> - It reflects “I almost paid more, but I bought it cheaper” (because the demand curve is decreasing: when q is small, consumers are willing to pay more)  

> **(3) Formula**  
> - (Note) Typically, it is preferred to compute using the pₓ–x curve  

**Figure 5.** Diagram of consumer surplus

> **(4) Note**  
> - In [Producer Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1893), there is a similar concept called producer surplus  
> - Together, the two relate to marginal revenue
