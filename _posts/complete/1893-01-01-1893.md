### **1. Overview**

⑴ **k**: quantity of capital (capital)  
⑵ **ℓ**: quantity of labor (labour)  
⑶ **q**: firm’s total output (seems to be an abbreviation of “quantity”)  
⑷ **r**: return from capital (an abbreviation of “rate,” i.e., interest)  
⑸ **w**: return from labor (wage)

### **2. Production Function** (production function)

⑴ Assume the firm’s output **q** is a function of **k** and **ℓ**, i.e., **f(k, ℓ)**.

> ① **Marginal product (MP):** distinguished as **MPk** and **MPℓ**  
> ② **Average product (AP):** distinguished as **APk** and **APℓ**  
> ③ At the maximum of the average product, the average product and marginal product coincide.

**Figure 1.** Total product, average product, marginal product

⑵ **Returns to scale** (returns to scale)

> ① **Increasing returns to scale (IRS)**  
>> ○ **Definition:** when all inputs are multiplied by **k**, output increases by **more than k** (similar to an “amplification” effect)  
>> ○ For **t > 1**, **f(tk, tℓ) > t f(k, ℓ)**

> ② **Decreasing returns to scale (DRS)**  
>> ○ **Definition:** when all inputs are multiplied by **k**, output increases by **k or less**  
>> ○ For **t > 1**, **f(tk, tℓ) < t f(k, ℓ)**  
>> ○ In this case, the firm should reduce its scale of operation.

> ③ **Constant returns to scale (CRS)**  
>> ○ **Definition:** when all inputs are multiplied by **k**, output increases by **exactly k**  
>> ○ For **t > 1**, **f(tk, tℓ) = t f(k, ℓ)**

⑶ **Isoquant curve** (isoquant curve): differs from the [indifference curve](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1879) in that it always represents a **cardinal** production level.

> ① **Definition:** a curve representing the same level of output. Related to **k(ℓ)** (**∵** it can be separated in an implicit-function representation)  
> ② **Feature 1. Downward sloping:** since the two inputs are substitutable, if one increases, the other can decrease to keep output constant  
> ③ **Feature 2. Law of diminishing marginal product:** convexity of the isoquant to the origin; also called the law of diminishing returns  
>> ○ the degree to which one input can substitute for the other decreases as the usage of that input increases  
>> ○ **Reason:** if there is a fixed input, increasing its use tends to increase inefficiency (e.g., mutual interference)  
>> ○ (Note) marginal product can increase at early stages  
> ④ **Feature 3.** farther from the origin implies higher output  
> ⑤ **Feature 4.** two isoquants do not intersect  
> ⑥ **Marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS):** related to **-k'(ℓ)**  
>> ○ **Definition:** indicates the degree of substitution between inputs  
>> ○ the negative sign is to take the absolute value  
>> ○ **Law of diminishing marginal rate of technical substitution**  
> ⑦ **Perfect substitutes**  
>> ○ **Definition:** one input can completely substitute for the other  
>> ○ isoquants appear as **straight lines**  
> ⑧ **Perfect complements (non-substitutable inputs)**  
>> ○ **Definition:** when output does not increase even if one input increases while the other is fixed  
>> ○ isoquants appear as **right angles**; substitution between the two inputs is impossible

⑷ **Production possibility curve (PPC)** (production possibility curve; PPC)

> ① **Overview**  
>> ○ Simple definition: a curve showing combinations of goods that an economy can produce at maximum capacity  
>> ○ Strict definition: a graph showing combinations of two goods that can be produced in full-employment equilibrium  
>> ○ plotted in the first quadrant  
> ② Points farther from the origin than the PPC: **not feasible**  
> ③ Points closer to the origin than the PPC: **inefficient**  
> ④ **Law of increasing opportunity cost** (law of increasing opportunity cost)  
>> ○ **Meaning 1.** in reality, the PPC is concave to the origin  
>> ○ **Meaning 2.** as the output of one good increases, its opportunity cost increases  
>> ○ **Meaning 3.** the slope of the PPC increases  
>> ○ **Tip:** the slope of the PPC represents opportunity cost  
>> ○ (Note) if opportunity cost increases → concave; constant → straight line; decreasing → convex  
>> ○ Fundamental reason: as output increases, less efficient factors are employed, raising opportunity cost  
> ⑤ [Welfare economics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044): the PPC concept is used extensively

### **3. Cost Function** (cost function)

⑴ **Cost** (cost)

> ① Everyday meaning: the amount of budget actually spent/reduced  
> ② Economic meaning: **opportunity cost**; called **economic cost**  
> ③ Unless stated otherwise, “cost” refers to the economic meaning

⑵ **Assumption:** **v** and **w** represent the costs of capital **k** and labor **ℓ**, respectively.

⑶ **Producer’s cost minimization problem:** solved using the [Lagrange multiplier method](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1813)

⑷ **Contingent (conditional) input demand:** refers to the solutions **kc(v, w, q)** and **ℓc(v, w, q)** from the cost-minimization problem

⑸ **Total cost function** (total cost function)

> ① **MC(v, w, q):** marginal cost function  
>> ○ has a U-shaped graph  
>> ○ Initially: marginal cost decreases as marginal product rises  
>> ○ Later: marginal cost increases due to diminishing marginal product

> ② **AC(v, w, q):** average cost function  
>> ○ has a U-shaped graph  
>> ○ Initially: fixed costs are spread over more units, so average cost falls  
>> ○ Later: once output exceeds a certain level, rising marginal cost raises average cost  
>> ○ The average cost curve always passes through the **minimum point** of the marginal cost curve and the variable marginal cost curve  
>> ○ Intuition: when **average cost = marginal cost**, an additional unit does not change average cost

⑹ **Short-run cost minimization problem**

> ① **Fixed input** (fixed input; also called short-run input)  
>> ○ **Definition:** an input whose quantity cannot be changed in the short run (or within a given period)  
>> ○ Capital is the 대표적인 fixed input: in the short run, **vk1** is treated as a fixed cost

> ② **Variable input** (variable input)  
>> ○ **Definition:** an input whose quantity can be freely adjusted during the period of analysis  
>> ○ Labor is the 대표적인 variable input: **wℓ** is treated as a variable cost

> ③ **Short run** (short-run)  
>> ○ **Definition:** a period during which one or more inputs are fixed  
>> ○ usually refers to the period when capital is fixed (among capital and labor)

> ④ **Long run** (long-run)  
>> ○ **Definition:** a sufficiently long period during which all inputs can be adjusted  
>> ○ neither capital nor labor is fixed

> ⑤ Short-run cost minimization problem (short-run cost minimization problem)  
> ⑥ (Note) which of **k** and **ℓ** is fixed is not important  
> ⑦ **SC:** short-run total cost function  
> ⑧ **SAC:** short-run average cost function  
> ⑨ **SMC:** short-run marginal cost function  
> ⑩ **SAFC:** short-run average fixed cost function (the “fixed” here means **k** is fixed)  
> ⑪ **SAVC:** short-run average variable cost function (the “variable” here means **ℓ** varies)

⑺ **Long-run cost function**

**Figure 2.** Deriving the long-run cost function from short-run cost functions

> ① In the short run, fixed inputs exist; in the long run, all inputs are variable  
> ② The long-run cost function is the pointwise minimum of the short-run cost functions across different facilities

⑻ **Economies of scale**

> ① **Economies of scale:** average production cost decreases as output increases  
> ② **Diseconomies of scale:** average production cost increases as output increases  
>> ○ Example: musical instruments, pottery  
> ③ (Related concept) **Economies of scope**  
>> ○ cost advantages from producing multiple products jointly within one firm  
>> ○ **Example 1.** shoes and handbags  
>> ○ **Example 2.** reusing production facilities and distribution networks  
>> ○ **Example 3.** a ramen company and snack products

### **4. Profit** (profit)

⑴ **Profit maximization problem** (profit maximization problem)

**Figure 3.** Example of the total revenue curve and total cost curve

> ① **Profit:** since it includes cost **C**, you must first solve the cost-minimization problem  
> ② **Revenue** (revenue)  
> ③ **Marginal revenue (MR):** additional sales revenue from producing one more unit  
>> ○ (Note) in perfect competition, output changes do not affect price, so it equals price  
> ④ **Marginal cost (MC):** additional cost to produce one more unit  
> ⑤ Solved using the [Lagrange multiplier method](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1813)  
>> ○ if marginal cost is a decreasing function, there is no solution to the profit-maximization problem  
>> ○ reason: the Lagrange method finds stationary points; in that case it yields a minimum instead

⑵ **Optimal output level:** denoted **q\***

---

### **5. Supply Curve** (supply curve)

⑴ **Supply curve**

> ① **Definition:** a curve with quantity supplied on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis  
> ② A perfectly competitive market has a supply curve that is a horizontal line at the common product price

⑵ **Producer surplus** (producer surplus)

> ① **Definition:** with price **p = p0**, the integral of the price difference between the horizontal price line and the marginal cost curve over quantity **q**  
> ② i.e., the satisfaction a producer gains by selling at a higher price  
> ③ (Note) “could have sold cheaply but sold expensively” (**∵** because the cost curve is increasing, smaller **q** would be sold at a lower price)  
> ④ Formalization (omitted here)  
> ⑤ (Note) in consumer theory, there is a similar concept called [consumer surplus](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1879).  
**:** Together, they form **total surplus**.
