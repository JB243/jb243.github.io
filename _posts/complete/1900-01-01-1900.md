## **1. Perfect Competition**

⑴ **Market:** the set of all sellers and buyers that, through interaction, determine the price of a good.

⑵ **Scope of a market**

> ① **Vertical scope:** the scope of a market depending on the degree of integration across distribution stages.  
> ② **Spatial scope:** e.g., a gold market vs. an agricultural products market.  
> ③ **Time scope:** the more storable a good is, the longer the relevant time scope of the market.  
> ④ **Form of the product:** e.g., an automobile market vs. a tractor market.

⑶ **Perfectly competitive market:** a market consisting only of **price-takers**.

> ① **Requirement 1.** There are very many producers and consumers participating in the market transaction.  
>> ○ No individual agent can affect the market price.  
>> ○ Everyone takes the price as given.

> ② **Requirement 2.** The product is homogeneous.  
>> ○ A particular producer’s product cannot receive a higher price than other producers’ products within the same industry.  
>> ○ **Price-taker:** a firm that can sell as much as it wants up to **P\***, but cannot sell at all at any price higher than **P\***.

> ③ **Requirement 2-1. Law of One Price:** **the market price P can be treated as a constant.**  
>> ○ One way to evaluate market performance is to check whether the law of one price holds.  
>> ○ Even if the law of one price holds, transport costs by distance prevent prices from becoming perfectly identical.  
>> ○ In pre-modern societies, information gaps made markets inefficient, so price differences often exceeded the range explainable by transport costs.  
>> ○ In England, the creation of the **penny post** (Paypost) system—an efficient postal system—contributed substantially to reducing such price differences.

> ④ **Requirement 3.** No barriers to entry.  
>> ○ New producers can enter and existing producers can exit freely.

> ⑤ **Requirement 4.** All economic agents have perfect information.

> ⑥ **In reality, perfectly competitive markets do not exist:** the concept serves as a benchmark for evaluating real-world market structures.

## **2. Short-run Supply by a Single Firm**

⑴ **Terminology**

> ① **SC (short-run total cost function):** the cost incurred to produce quantity *q* when there is at least one fixed factor of production.  
> ② **SAC (short-run average cost function):** SC divided by *q*.  
> ③ **SMC (short-run marginal cost function):** the derivative of SC with respect to *q*.  
> ④ **SAFC (short-run average fixed cost function)**  
> ⑤ **SAVC (short-run average variable cost function)**

⑵ **A firm’s short-run supply curve**

**Figure 1.** A firm’s short-run supply curve

> ① The marginal cost curve always intersects the average cost (AC) curve or the average variable cost (AVC) curve at their extrema.  
> ② When the market price is sufficiently high, the firm chooses output **Q** such that that price equals marginal cost.  
> ③ If the market price is lower than the minimum point of the AVC curve, the firm stops producing.  
>> ○ The highest market price at which the firm is indifferent to producing or not is called the **shutdown price**.  
>> ○ (Note) If you think carefully, shutdown is relevant only when the cost curve is discontinuous at the origin.  
> ④ **Short-run supply curve:** the portion of the marginal cost curve above the shutdown point.  
> ⑤ **Example**  
>> ○ P = P\* = 2  
>> ○ TC = Q² + 10 if Q > 0, 6 if Q = 0  
>> ○ FC = 6, VC = Q² + 4  
>> ○ π = PQ − TC  
>> ○ (Note) At the shutdown price P\* = 4, π(0) = π(q\*) holds.

## **3. Market Equilibrium for Short-run Supply**

⑴ **Short-run market supply function:** for each firm *i*’s supply function *qᵢ*.

**Figure 2.** The industry’s short-run supply curve

⑵ **Market demand function**

> ① Each individual firm faces a horizontal demand curve.  
> ② The market demand curve slopes downward.

⑶ **Market equilibrium**

> ① **Unknowns:** kᶜ, ℓᶜ, P\*, q\*  
>> ○ Because this is a short-run supply equilibrium, the number of firms **n** is given as a constant, not an unknown.  
>> ○ In a long-run supply equilibrium, **n** is an unknown.

> ② **Condition 1. Cost minimization problem:** under this condition, express kᶜ and ℓᶜ as functions/relations in terms of *q, v, w*.  
> ③ **Condition 2. Profit maximization problem**  
> ④ **Condition 3. Market demand equals market supply**  
>> ○ If Qᴰ > Qˢ, consumers try to buy more even at a higher price.  
>> ○ If Qᴰ < Qˢ, suppliers try to sell more by lowering the price.  
>> ○ If Qᴰ = Qˢ, the market price **P** does not change.

> ⑤ Combine **Condition 2** and **Condition 3** to determine P\* and q\*.

## **4. Long-run Supply by a Single Firm**

⑴ **Long-run profit maximization problem**

> ① **Setting:** since we focus only on supply, assume the price **P** is a constant.  
> ② If the market price is below the minimum of the AC curve, the firm stops producing.

⑵ **Long-run supply function**

> ① The firm should produce at the output level that maximizes profit.  
> ② **First-order condition:** the optimal output *q* is generally where the derivative of π(q) is zero (when differentiable).  
> ③ **Second-order condition:** π(q) must be concave (so the second derivative is negative). Equivalently, the marginal cost must be increasing.  
> ④ **Long-run supply curve:** the set of profit-maximizing output levels as a function of price.

## **5. Market Equilibrium for Long-run Supply**

⑴ **Market demand curve**

> ① **Case 1. Constant-cost industry:** a price change → economic profit increases → new firms enter → a horizontal market supply curve.  
> ② **Case 2. Increasing-cost industry:** an upward-sloping market supply curve.

⑵ **Market equilibrium**

> ① **Unknowns:** kᶜ, ℓᶜ, P\*, q\*, n\*  
>> ○ Because this is a long-run supply equilibrium, the number of firms **n** is not a constant but an unknown.  
>> ○ In a short-run supply equilibrium, **n** is given.

> ② **Condition 1. Cost minimization problem:** under this condition, express kᶜ and ℓᶜ as functions/relations in terms of *q, v, w*.  
> ③ **Condition 2. Firms’ profits are zero**  
>> ○ Profit here means **economic profit**: each firm earns no more than it could in other industries.  
>> ○ Thus, accounting profit can be positive.  
>> ○ If there are profits, new firms enter; if there are no profits, firms exit the market.  
>> ○ Because equilibrium occurs at the minimum of ATC, production is socially efficient overall.

> ⑤ **Condition 3. Market demand equals market supply**

> ⑥ **Method 1.** Use **Condition 2-1** and **Condition 2-2** to find P\* and q\*, then use **Condition 3** to determine n\*.  
> ⑦ **Method 2.** Use one of **Condition 2-1** or **Condition 2-2** together with **Condition 3** to determine P\* and q\* (with n\* given).  
>> ○ For f(k, ℓ) = k^α ℓ^(1−α), 0 < α < 1, no meaningful conclusion follows from MC = AC.

> ⑧ Because two unknowns are adjusted, the long-run marginal cost curve, the **minimum point** of the long-run average cost curve, and the marginal revenue curve meet at **one point**.
