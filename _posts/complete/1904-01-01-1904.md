## **1. Monopoly** (monopoly) (e.g., municipal water supply, cable TV)

### ⑴ Overview

> ① **Definition:** There is only one firm in the market, and the (downward‑sloping) demand faced by that firm is the market demand.

> ② **Characteristic 1.** A single supplier

> ③ **Characteristic 2.** No close substitutes

> ④ **Characteristic 3.** Complete barriers to entry

### ⑵ Causes of monopoly

> ① **Economies of scale**

>> ○ **Natural monopoly:** A monopoly arising from economies of scale

>> ○ **Minimum efficient scale (MES):** The output level at which average cost reaches its minimum

>> ○ **When the average cost curve keeps declining:** If MES occurs only at a very high level of output, monopoly/oligopoly tends to arise

>> ○ **Reason:** Only the firm with the largest output can produce at the lowest cost, i.e., most efficiently

> ② **Government policy**

>> ○ **Example 1.** Patents

>> ○ **Example 2.** Exclusive sales rights or state monopoly rights: In Korea, for instance, tobacco, ginseng, etc.

> ③ **Competitive strategy**

>> ○ **Example 1.** Advertising (advertisement)

>>> ○ **Positive aspects:** [1] Intensifies competition and lowers market prices. [2] Provides information

>>> ○ **Negative aspects:** [1] False/exaggerated advertising that misleads consumers. [2] Can function as a barrier to entry

>> ○ **Example 2.** Product differentiation

>> ○ **Example 3.** Predatory pricing: Temporarily lowering prices to exclude competitors

>> ○ **Example 4.** Tying: Bundling a monopoly product with another product to strengthen monopoly power in the other product as well

> ④ **Lack of information**

### ⑶ Comparison: perfect competition vs. monopoly

**Table. 1.** Comparison of a perfectly competitive market and a monopoly market

### ⑷ Equilibrium in a monopoly market

> ① **Market demand curve:** Because there is only one supplier, the demand faced by the firm is the market demand. It is also the AR (average revenue) curve.

**Figure. 1.** Market demand curves in perfect competition vs. monopoly

> ② **Market supply curve**

>> ○ In a monopoly market, a supply curve is **not defined**

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Since the monopolist controls price, the relationship between price and quantity supplied is not meaningful

>> ○ **Reason 2.** A monopolist is a price setter and does not take the market price as given  
>>   ○ Instead, price and output are determined where **MC = MR**

> ③ **Market equilibrium:** Production occurs at the profit‑maximizing output level *qₘ*.

> ④ Relationship between marginal cost and marginal revenue

> ⑤ **Example:** Suppose a monopolist has demand **q(P) = 100 − P** (where 0 ≤ P ≤ 100), and cost **C(q) = q²**.

### ⑸ Welfare in a monopoly market

> ① (Reference) **Gross benefit**

> ② **Total surplus (net social benefit, total welfare):** A measure of the **total satisfaction** of producers and consumers

> ③ **Deadweight loss (DWL):** Also called the welfare triangle, excess burden, economic net loss, etc.

>> ○ **Case 1. Perfect competition:** Total surplus is maximized. From the firm’s perspective, there is some loss.

>>> ○ **P = MC**

>>> ○ This situation is called the **benevolent social planner’s problem**.

>>> ○ The resulting market outcome is the **socially optimal outcome**.

**Figure. 2.** p‑q curve under perfect competition

>> ○ **Case 2. Monopoly:** The monopolist’s surplus increases, but total surplus decreases by the amount of DWL.

>>> ○ **P > MC**

>>> ○ **Why the MR curve lies below the demand curve:** Because of the **price effect** and the **quantity effect**

>>> ○ **Quantity effect:** When one more unit is sold, total revenue increases by the price at which that unit is sold

>>> ○ **Price effect:** To sell the last unit, the monopolist must lower the price for all units sold, reducing total revenue

>>> ○ Due to the price effect, the MR curve lies below the demand curve (and thus below where MC would meet demand)

**Figure. 3.** p‑q curve under monopoly

>> ○ **Inefficiencies of monopoly**

>>> ○ With profits largely guaranteed, incentives to work hard/innovate may be weak

>>> ○ Wasteful expenditures may be made to maintain barriers to entry

>>> ○ Monopoly can hinder technological progress (though some argue it can also promote innovation)

### ⑹ Price discrimination (price discrimination)

> ① **Definition:** Charging different prices to different buyers for the same product

> ② **Prerequisites**

>> ○ The firm must have **market power** (so it can set prices)

>> ○ **Resale must be impossible** (if resale is possible, arbitrage complicates the model)

>> ○ **Price elasticities of demand must differ** across buyers/markets

> ③ **Methods of price discrimination**

>> ○ Advanced purchase restrictions

>> ○ Volume discounts

>> ○ Two‑part tariffs

> ④ **Case 1. Pure monopoly:** No price discrimination

> ⑤ **Case 2. Price discrimination using two prices**

**Figure. 4.** Price discrimination using two prices

**Figure. 5.** Profit maximization of a discriminating monopolist

>> ○ **MRA = MRB:** If profits differ, the firm produces more for the side with higher profit

>> ○ **MRA = MRB = MC:** The supplier increases total output up to the point that maximizes total profit

>> ○ Consumers with lower price elasticity are less sensitive to price, so they are charged a relatively higher price

>> ○ Compared to pure monopoly, output is higher and the welfare loss is smaller

> ⑥ **Case 3. Perfect price discrimination (perfect price discrimination):** Also called first‑degree price discrimination

>> ○ **Definition:** The monopolist knows each consumer’s maximum willingness to pay and charges exactly that amount

>> ○ **Characteristic 1.** No deadweight loss: Output is the same as under perfect competition

>> ○ **Characteristic 2.** Consumer surplus is zero: All surplus is captured as the monopolist’s profit

>> ○ Example: Flea markets

>> ○ In practice, it is difficult because the firm does not know consumers’ reservation prices

### ⑺ Government policies toward monopoly

> ① **Nationalization (state ownership)**

>> ○ Inefficient because there is no incentive to minimize costs

> ② **Price regulation**

>> ○ For a natural monopoly, average cost slopes downward; marginal cost should **of course** lie below average cost

**Figure. 6.** Price–demand curve for a natural monopoly firm

>> ○ **Marginal‑cost pricing:** Set price at **P = MC**

>>> ○ **Advantage:** Efficient resource allocation

>>> ○ **Disadvantage:** Deficits occur. For natural monopolies with economies of scale, the firm may incur losses.

>> ○ **Average‑cost pricing:** Set price at **P = AC**

>>> ○ **Advantage:** No deficit (prevents the monopolist from losing money)

>>> ○ **Disadvantage:** Inefficient resource allocation

>> ○ **Mankiw’s view:** No matter what price regulation is chosen, it is hard to avoid inefficiency due to the capture theory of regulation

>>> ○ **Capture theory of regulation:** If regulation persists for a long time, a close relationship forms between regulators and the regulated, and regulators end up setting policy in the direction desired by the regulated party

>> ○ **Krugman’s view:** It is acceptable as long as the price ceiling is not set too high

> ③ **Pro‑competition policy**

>> ○ Privatization to encourage competition

>> ○ In the U.S., when the electric power infrastructure industry was broken up and privatized, blackouts and fires occurred frequently

> ④ **Antitrust law**

>> ○ **Sherman Antitrust Act (1890):** Defined agreements among oligopolistic firms as criminal acts

>> ○ **Clayton Act (1914):** Strengthened antitrust law further and enabled private lawsuits even against attempts to collude

## **2. (Conceptual distinction) Monopolistic competition market** (monopolistic competitive market) (e.g., novels, movies)

### ⑴ Characteristics

> ① **Many suppliers:** Similar to perfect competition in terms of the number of sellers

> ② **Product differentiation:** Individual firms are not price takers

>> ○ They face a **downward‑sloping** demand curve

>> ○ Each product attempts differentiation under a brand name, gaining some degree of market power

>> ○ **Non‑price competition:** Competition via means other than price

> ③ **Free entry:** Firms enter and exit until economic profit becomes zero

### ⑵ Formalization

> ① Profit maximization problem

> ② **Elasticity of demand:** If |ε_{q,P}| > 1, demand is said to be elastic

> ③ **Lerner index:** Also called percentage markup, market power

### ⑶ Short‑run market equilibrium

**Figure. 7.** Short‑run equilibrium curve in monopolistic competition

> ① The diagram is the same as the short‑run equilibrium curve under monopoly, but differs in that it represents an individual firm’s curves

> ② Production occurs where ε > 1. Positive profit is earned

### ⑷ Long‑run market equilibrium

As other firms enter, the demand curve continues to shift downward from the short‑run equilibrium.

**Figure. 8.** Long‑run equilibrium curve in monopolistic competition

> ① **Characteristic 1.** Output below the minimum point of the long‑run average cost curve: implies excess capacity

> ② **Characteristic 2.** Why the ATC curve is tangent to the demand curve at the Q where MR = MC: because profit is maximized at zero
