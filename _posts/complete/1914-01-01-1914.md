## **1. Overview**

⑴ **Player**: an economic agent participating in the game (e.g., firms, consumers).

⑵ **Strategy**: a plan describing what action each player will take.

⑶ **Payoff**: the utility each player obtains as a result of the strategy choices (i.e., the game outcome).

> ① **uᵢ**: the utility (payoff) of player *i*  
> ② **sᵢ**: the strategy of player *i*  
> ③ **s₋ᵢ**: the strategies of players 1, 2, ···, i−1, i+1, ···, n  
> ④ Typically represented in a table form, i.e., a **payoff matrix**.

⑷ **Strategy profile**: the tuple (s₁, ···, sₙ).

⑸ **Game**: the set consisting of players, all feasible strategies, and payoffs.

⑹ **Game theory**: the theory of finding strategy profiles.

⑺ **BR (best response)**

> ① **Definition**: for one player, fixing the other players’ strategies, a strategy that maximizes that player’s utility.  
> ② A player may have multiple best responses (ties), so a BR need not be unique.

⑻ **Nash equilibrium (NE)**

> ① **Definition**: a strategy profile where every player’s strategy is a best response.  
> ② In other words, no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their choice.  
> ③ (Note) **John Nash**: winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences; protagonist of the movie *A Beautiful Mind*.

⑼ **Dominant strategy equilibrium (DSE)**

> ① **Definition**: a strategy profile where all players choose their **dominant strategies**.  
> ② A drawback is that it is not common in reality.  
> ③ **Dominant strategy**: a strategy that maximizes a player’s utility regardless of the other players’ strategies.  
> ④ **Theorem 1.** DSE ⊂ NE  
> ⑤ **Theorem 2.** Even if a dominant strategy equilibrium does not exist, a Nash equilibrium may still exist.
>
> > ○ **Reason**: the conditions for Nash equilibrium are weaker (less restrictive).

## **2. Simultaneous Games** (simultaneous game)

⑴ **Assumptions**: cooperation is impossible, and the game is played only once.

⑵ **Representation 1. Normal-form representation**

> ① **Example 1.** Match / mismatch game
>
> **Table 2.** Match / mismatch game
>
> > ○ In each cell “#, #”, the first number is player 1’s utility, and the second number is player 2’s utility.  
> > ○ πᵢ(sᵢ, s₋ᵢ) denotes the utility player *i* gets when player *i* chooses sᵢ and the other players choose s₋ᵢ.  
> > ○ Check all best responses (BRs) and mark them in the table as follows.
>
> **Table 3.** Match / mismatch game with BRs marked
>
> > > ○ BR₁(A ∈ S₂) = B ∈ S₁  
> > > ○ BR₁(B ∈ S₂) = A ∈ S₁  
> > > ○ BR₂(A ∈ S₁) = A ∈ S₂  
> > > ○ BR₂(B ∈ S₁) = B ∈ S₂
>
> > ○ Since there is no cell where both payoffs are underlined, there is **no Nash equilibrium**.

> ② **Example 2.** Duopoly pricing game
>
> **Table 4.** Duopoly pricing game
>
> > ○ In each cell “#, #”, the first number is player 1’s utility, and the second number is player 2’s utility.  
> > ○ πᵢ(sᵢ, s₋ᵢ) denotes the utility player *i* gets when player *i* chooses sᵢ and the other players choose s₋ᵢ.  
> > ○ **Underlining method**: check all BRs and underline accordingly.
>
> **Table 5.** Duopoly pricing game with BRs marked
>
> > > ○ BR₁(L ∈ S₂) = L ∈ S₁  
> > > ○ BR₁(H ∈ S₂) = L ∈ S₁  
> > > ○ BR₂(L ∈ S₁) = L ∈ S₂  
> > > ○ BR₂(H ∈ S₁) = L ∈ S₂
>
> > ○ **Nash equilibrium**: (s₁, s₂) = (L, L)  
> > ○ **DSE**: (s₁, s₂) = (L, L)
>
> > > ○ Player 1’s dominant strategy is L (**because** BR₁(L ∈ S₂) = L ∈ S₁ and BR₁(H ∈ S₂) = L ∈ S₁)  
> > > ○ Player 2’s dominant strategy is L (**because** BR₂(L ∈ S₁) = L ∈ S₂ and BR₂(H ∈ S₁) = L ∈ S₂)

⑶ **Representation 2. Game tree** (extensive form): each node is called a **decision node**.

(Setting is the same as the duopoly game.)

## **3. Sequential Games** (sequential game)

⑴ **Overview**

> ① **Feature 1. Single-agent decision problem**
>
> > ○ **Definition**: a situation where one player can determine their strategy **completely independently** of what the other player does.  
> > ○ In a typical simultaneous game, a player is affected by the other player’s strategy, so it does not fit the definition.  
> > ○ In a sequential game, the first mover has the initiative, so it corresponds to a single-agent decision problem.  
> > ○ (Note) A simultaneous game can also be a single-agent decision problem if one side’s strategy plays no role.
>
> ② **Feature 2.** Unlike simultaneous games, sequential games distinguish **actions** from **plans of actions**.

⑵ **Example**

> ① **Normal-form representation of a sequential game**: may include unrealistic Nash equilibria.
>
> **Table 6.** Normal-form representation of a sequential game
>
> > ○ **Setting**: the Hardware firm moves first; the Software firm moves afterward.  
> > ○ Meaning of (HH, HS): one Software strategy—choose H if Hardware chooses H, and choose H if Hardware chooses S.  
> > ○ (S, (SH, SS)) is an unrealistic solution (**because** the Hardware firm would naturally choose H).
>
> ② **Extensive-form representation of a sequential game**: does not include unrealistic Nash equilibria.
>
> **Figure 2.** Extensive-form of a sequential game
>
> ③ (Comment) An important feature is that, unlike simultaneous games, these two representation methods can differ for sequential games.

⑶ **Proper subgame**

> ① **Information set**: the set of nodes where a player could be.
>
> > ○ In **Figure 1**, Player 2’s information set consists of a single node.  
> > ○ In **Figure 2**, Player 2’s information set consists of two nodes.
>
> ② **Proper subgame**: in an extensive-form game, a subtree whose root is a singleton information set.
>
> > ○ That is, an independent game contained within a larger game.  
> > ○ **Figure 2** has three proper subgames in total.
>
> ③ **Feature 1.** Any game contains itself as a subgame.  
> ④ **Feature 2.** A simultaneous game has only one subgame.  
> ⑤ **Feature 3.** Since the root decision-maker is a single player, it is a special case of a single-agent decision problem.

⑷ **SPE (subgame-perfect equilibrium)**

> ① **Definition**: a strategy profile that is a Nash equilibrium in **every** proper subgame.  
> ② (Note) For simultaneous games, the NE concept is relevant; for sequential games, the perfect equilibrium concept is relevant.  
> ③ **Feature 1.** An SPE must be an NE.  
> ④ **Feature 2.** An NE need not be an SPE.
>
> > ○ **Reason**: proper subgames eliminate unrealistic Nash equilibria.  
> > ○ (Comment) Proper subgames can be seen as a method of solving via the extensive form, thus avoiding unrealistic outcomes.

⑸ **Forward induction**: a top-down method to find SPE.

> ① **1st.** Find all NEs.
>
> > ○ In the above example, you can find (H, (HH, HS)), (H, (HH, SS)), (S, (SH, SS)).
>
> ② **2nd.** Check whether each is an NE in every proper subgame.
>
> > ○ (H, (HH, HS)): inappropriate because in the subgame following Hardware choosing S, Software chooses H.  
> > ○ (H, (HH, SS)): this is an SPE.  
> > ○ (S, (SH, SS)): inappropriate because in the subgame following Hardware choosing H, Software chooses S.

⑹ **Backward induction**: a bottom-up method to find SPE.

> ① **1st.** In the extensive-form sequential game, start from the leaves and move upward to find the first singleton information set.  
> ② **2nd.** Find the NE in each proper subgame.  
> ③ **3rd.** Move up to the second singleton information set.  
> ④ **4th.** Find the NE in each proper subgame and mark it appropriately.  
> ⑤ **5th.** Repeat steps ③–④ until reaching the root of the game.
>
> ⑥ Example
>
> **Figure 3.** Example of backward induction  
> (H, (HH, SS)) is the SPE.

## **4. Mixed Strategy Games**

⑴ **Definition**: strategies are chosen probabilistically.

⑵ **Feature**: the best response changes depending on the probability parameters.

⑶ **Example**

**Table 7.** Example of a mixed strategy game

> ① **Condition 1.** Player 1 chooses H with probability ω and S with probability 1−ω.  
> ② **Condition 2.** Player 2 chooses H with probability h and S with probability 1−h.  
> ③ **BR (best response)**: understand that it is a response to the opponent’s parameter h or ω.  
> ④ There are three Nash equilibrium solutions in total.

---

## **5. Bayesian Games**

⑴ **Overview**

> ① **Incomplete information**: at least one player does not know the payoffs for all possible cases of the other players.  
> ② **Bayesian game**: a game based on incomplete information.
>
> > ○ A mixed strategy game assigns probability to **actions**, whereas a Bayesian game uses probability to **infer information**.
>
> ③ **BNE (Bayesian Nash equilibrium)**: for two players, a strategy profile (s₁*(t), s₂*) satisfying:
>
> > ○ **Condition 1.** Player 1, who knows t, must choose a best response.  
> > ○ **Condition 2.** Player 2, who does not know t, must choose based on expected values.

⑵ **Example**

> ① **Problem setting**: with probability 1/3, t = −1; with probability 2/3, t = 3. Only player 1 knows the value of t (singleton).
>
> ② Normal-form representation
>
> **Table 8.** Normal-form representation of a Bayesian game
>
> ③ Extensive form: the root node is called a **chance node**. Note that it is singleton only for Player 1.
>
> **Figure 4.** Extensive-form of a Bayesian game
>
> ④ Strategy profile notation: if t = −1 implies choosing H, write it as H₋₁ (or H1 in the original notation), etc.
>
> ⑤ Determining Player 1’s best response
>
> > ○ If t = −1, Player 1 should always choose S: discard strategies involving H₋₁.  
> > ○ **BNE candidates**: ((S₋₁, H₃), H), ((S₋₁, H₃), S), ((S₋₁, S₃), H), ((S₋₁, S₃), S)  
> > ○ ((S₋₁, H₃), H): best response (OK)  
> > ○ ((S₋₁, H₃), S): better to switch to ((S₋₁, S₃), S)  
> > ○ ((S₋₁, S₃), H): better to switch to ((S₋₁, H₃), H)  
> > ○ ((S₋₁, S₃), S): best response (OK)
>
> ⑥ Determining Player 2’s best response
>
> > ○ Evaluate ((S₋₁, H₃), H)  
> > ○ Evaluate ((S₋₁, S₃), S)
>
> ⑦ **Conclusion**: the BNEs are ((S₋₁, H₃), H) and ((S₋₁, S₃), S).

## **6. The Economics of Commitment** (commitment)

⑴ **Definition**: actions taken to demonstrate a credible intention to carry out one’s threat.

⑵ The purpose is to convince the opponent that you must follow through on the threatened action even though it will obviously harm you as well.
