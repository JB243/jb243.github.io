## **1. Overview**

### (1) Definition

> ① **Oligopoly market:** A market with a small number of firms (e.g., tennis balls, cigarettes)
>
>> ○ **Type 1.** Independent behavior of each firm  
>> ○ **Type 2.** Tacit collusion → price leadership model  
>> ○ **Type 3.** Full collusion → cartel
>
>> ○ In the real world, most markets are oligopolies: because other market theories did not fit reality well, funding for economics had been decreasing before oligopoly theory was developed.

> ③ (Related concept) [Perfectly competitive market](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1900) (perfect competitive market) (e.g., agricultural products, milk)

> ④ (Related concept) [Monopoly market](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1904) (monopolistic market) (e.g., water supply, cable TV)

> ⑤ (Related concept) [Monopolistic competition](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1904) (monopolistic competitive market) (e.g., novels, movies)

### (2) Characteristics of an oligopoly market

> ① Market price is greater than marginal cost: differs from perfect competition where P* = MC(q*).  
> ② Each participant’s actions affect the market price: differs from monopoly where there is only one participant.  
> ③ Oligopoly output: more than monopoly, less than perfect competition.  
> ④ Oligopoly price: lower than monopoly, higher than perfect competition.  
> ⑤ As the number of firms increases, the oligopoly approaches perfect competition.

### (3) Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI)

> ① If three firms have market shares 60%, 25%, and 15%:
>
> 60^2 + 25^2 + 15^2 = 4,450

> ② U.S. Department of Justice guideline:
>
>> ○ HHI ＜ 1,500: highly competitive market  
>> ○ 1,500 ＜ HHI ＜ 2,500: moderately competitive market  
>> ○ 2,500 ＜ HHI: oligopoly  
>> ○ If HHI exceeds 1,500, mergers that significantly increase HHI may be subject to special investigation and may be blocked.

## **2. Price Leadership Model** (price leadership model)

### (1) A form where one firm sets the price and other firms follow it: a tacit-collusion regime.

### (2) **Example 1.** Jinyang Benz flyer advertisement

> ① An ad stating that if you bring a competitor’s flyer showing a lower price than theirs, they will refund *twice* the price difference.  
> ② A kind of chicken game—rather than the peak of price destruction, it functions as an invitation to tacit collusion.

---

## **3. Cartel Model** (cartel model)

### (1) A regime of full collusion.

### (2) Example: the oil cartel OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries)

---

## **4. Bertrand Model** (Bertrand model)

### (1) Definition: an imperfect competition model where **price** is the strategic variable (often used when it is difficult to adjust output).

> ① Di denotes the demand faced by firm i.  
> ② pi means firm i sets price pi as its strategy.  
> ③ p-i means the other firms (1, 2, ···, i-1, i+1, ···, n) set prices p1, p2, ···, pi-1, pi+1, ···, pn as their strategies.  
> ④ For simplicity, consider only i = 1, 2.  
> ⑤ Each firm takes the rival’s price as given and chooses its own price: game theory applies.

### (2) Payoff

### (3) Nash equilibrium condition: the strategy profile (p1*, p2*) must satisfy the following.

> ① **Proposition 1.** (c, c) is one Nash equilibrium.  
> ② **Proposition 2.** (c, c) is the unique Nash equilibrium.
>
>> ○ There exists i such that pi ≤ p-i.  
>> ○ **Case 1.** c ＞ pi: firm i’s profit is negative, so pi = c is better (not a Nash equilibrium).  
>> ○ **Case 2.** c ＜ pi: if the other firm sets p-i = pi − ε, the other firm’s profit improves (not a Nash equilibrium).  
>> ○ **Case 3.** c = pi ＜ p-i: if c ＜ pi ＜ p-i, firm i’s profit becomes positive.

## **5. Kinked Demand Curve Model** (kinked demand curve)

### (1) Like the Bertrand model, it assumes firms compete via price.

**Figure 1.** Kinked demand curve model

### (2) Demand curve

> ① If a firm raises its price, rivals keep the current price: quantity demanded drops sharply when price increases.  
> ② If a firm cuts its price, rivals also cut their prices: quantity demanded does not rise much when price decreases.

### (3) Marginal revenue curve: explains why firms in reality do not change prices often.

> ① The marginal revenue curve becomes discontinuous in the middle, so within the discontinuity range the gain from changing the market price is not large.  
> ② The side effects from changing prices can be larger.

## **6. Cournot Model** (Cournot model, Qournot model) **:** also called “Kurnoh / Cournot” model

### (1) Overview

> ① Definition: an imperfect competition model where **quantity (output)** is the strategic variable (often used when it is difficult to change price).  
> ② Each firm takes the rival’s output as given and chooses its own output: game theory applies.

### (2) Payoff

### (3) Profit maximization problem

> ① BRi: best response of firm i  
> ② BRi(q-i): firm i’s best response when the other firms’ outputs (1, 2, ···, i-1, i+1, ···, n) are fixed

### (4) Nash equilibrium: also called Cournot equilibrium

### (5) Conclusion

## **7. Bertrand Model with Differentiated Products**

### (1) Definition: Products are not identical (not homogeneous), but demand for one product affects demand for the other.

> ① qi: demand faced by firm i  
> ② qi(pi, p-i): demand faced by firm i when firm i’s price is pi and the other firm’s price is p-i  
> ③ Example: Samsung Galaxy phone vs Apple iPhone

### (2) Payoff

### (3) Profit maximization problem

### (4) Nash equilibrium

---

## **8. Hotelling Model**

### (1) Overview

> ① Definition: for 0 ≤ a＜b ≤ L, consumer location ℓ, and seller location i  
> ② (Note) Distance does not have to be literal physical distance.  
> ③ If there are two sellers, the consumer location that yields equal utility from purchasing from either seller is as follows.

### (2) Demand for sellers at a and b

### (3) Payoff

### (4) Profit maximization problem

### (5) Nash equilibrium

## **9. Hotelling Model with Location Choice**

### (1) Situation: a slightly modified version of the Hotelling model

> ① **Stage 1.** Two firms choose locations a and b.  
> ② **Stage 2.** After observing the other firm’s location, each firm chooses its product price pa and pb.  
> ③ Using backward induction, one can find the Nash equilibrium.

### (2) Stage 2: This Nash equilibrium has already been covered in the Hotelling model.

> ① a: captive customers of the firm located at a  
> ② L-b: captive customers of the firm located at b  
> ③ Meaning: pb − pa is proportional to the difference in the number of captive customers and proportional to the distance between the two firms.

### (3) Stage 1: Each firm must choose a and b that maximize its payoff.

> ① **Conclusion 1.** If firms can choose only locations on the beach, firm a should locate at the far left (ℓ = 0).
>
>> ○ demand effect  
>> ○ price effect: by the Stage 2 Nash equilibrium condition, the price effect should be 0  
>> ○ strategic effect  
>> ○ Since the change in payoff with respect to increasing a is negative, a should be the smallest, 0

> ② **Conclusion 2.** If firms can choose only locations on the beach, firm b should locate at the far right (ℓ = L)

> ③ **Conclusion 3.** If firms can choose locations outside the beach, the following solution becomes the Nash equilibrium.

## **10. Stackelberg Model** (Stackelberg model)

### (1) Situation: a slightly modified version of the Cournot model

> ① Condition  
> ② **Stage 1.** Firm 1 is the leader (1<sup>st</sup> mover): firm 1 chooses its output q1  
> ③ **Stage 2.** Firm 2 is the follower: after observing q1, firm 2 chooses its output q2  
> ④ Using backward induction, one can find the Nash equilibrium.

### (2) Stage 2

### (3) Stage 1

### (4) Conclusion

> ① The Nash equilibrium outputs q1* and q2* are as follows.  
> ② Leader’s advantage: compared to the Cournot model, firm 1 earns more and firm 2 earns less.  
> ③ (Note) Depending on how the problem is set up, the follower may also gain.

---

## **11. Entry Deterrence**

### (1) Situation: a slightly modified version of the Stackelberg model

> ① Condition  
> ② **Stage 1.** Firm 1 chooses output q1  
> ③ **Stage 2.** After observing q1, firm 2 decides whether to enter the market: entry cost is K2  
> ④ **Stage 3.** If firm 2 enters, it chooses output q2  
> ⑤ Using backward induction, one can find the Nash equilibrium.

### (2) **Case 1.** K2 = 100

> ① **Stage 3**  
> ② **Stage 2.** Derive the condition under which firm 2 enters.  
> ③ **Stage 1.** Compare the three cases.
>
>> ○ **case 1.** q1 ＜ 100: firm 2 enters  
>> ○ **case 2.** q1 = 100: firm 2 may enter or may not enter (π1 graph has a discontinuity)  
>> ○ **case 3.** q1 ＞ 100: the lower q1 is, the better
>
>> ○ Therefore, (q1*, q2*) = (100, 0) is a Nash equilibrium, and firm 2’s entry is deterred in this case.  
>> ○ In **case 2**, because there are two possible outcomes, it is better to set q1 slightly greater than 100.

### (3) **Case 2.** K2 = 64

> ① **Stage 3**  
> ② **Stage 2.** Derive the condition under which firm 2 enters.  
> ③ **Stage 1.** Compare the three cases.
>
>> ○ **case 1.** q1 ＜ 104: firm 2 enters  
>> ○ **case 2.** q1 = 104: firm 2 may enter or may not enter (π1 graph has a discontinuity)  
>> ○ **case 3.** q1 ＞ 104: the lower q1 is, the better
>
>> ○ Therefore, (q1*, q2*) = (60, 30) is a Nash equilibrium; in this case firm 1 accommodates entry and compromises on q1.
