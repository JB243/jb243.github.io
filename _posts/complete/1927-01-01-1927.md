## **1. Overview**

⑴ **Setting**

> ① A situation in which one party offers a contract to another party, and the other party decides whether to accept it  
> ② **Principal:** the person or firm that offers the contract (e.g., shareholders)  
> ③ **Agent:** the person or firm that decides whether to accept the contract (e.g., CEO)  
> ④ Contract theory is the **simultaneous** version of incomplete information  
> ⑤ (Reference) [Signalling](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1935) is the **sequential** version of incomplete information  
> ⑥ We want to understand how the agent’s asymmetric information affects outcomes

⑵ **1st best**

> ① **Definition:** the contract proposed by the principal when there is **no** asymmetric information  
> ② **Feature 1.** The principal tries to maximize **total surplus**  
> ③ **Feature 2.** The principal designs the contract so that the agent’s surplus becomes **0**

⑶ **2nd best**

> ① **Definition:** the contract proposed by the principal when there **is** asymmetric information  
> ② **Feature:** the principal proposes a contract to maximize **their own surplus**

## **2. Hidden action model:** focusing on the owner–manager model

⑴ **Hidden action model:** also called the **moral hazard model**

> ① A case where the principal can observe only the **outcome** of the agent’s action  
> ② The principal cannot observe the agent’s **action itself**

⑵ **Terminology**

> ① **e:** effort  
> ② **πg:** gross profit (total profit)  
> ③ **s:** wage / salary  
> ④ **πn:** net profit (from the owner’s perspective)  
> ⑤ **c(e):** cost as a function of effort e  
>
> > ○ In general, assume **c'(e) > 0** and **c''(e) > 0**  
> > ○ (Note) If you accept that people generally dislike working, these assumptions make sense  
>
> ⑥ **U(s, e):** the manager’s utility function over wage and effort  
>
> > ○ **E(s) - c(e):** net benefit (from the manager’s perspective)  
> > ○ **(A/2) Var(s):** risk premium from wage uncertainty (risk aversion)  
> > ○ Assume **A > 0**

⑶ **1st best**

> ① **Setting:** the owner observes the manager’s effort e perfectly  
> ② **Equation 1.** Without negotiation, the owner offers the following wage schedule  
> ③ **Equation 2. Participation constraint:** the manager must obtain utility **≥ 0** to work  
> ④ **Equation 3.** The owner chooses **s\*** to maximize their net profit  
>
> > ○ To maximize net profit, the owner sets **s = c(e)**  
> > ○ The inequality can be rewritten as follows  
> > ○ Since **c'(e)** is strictly increasing, we can find **e\*** such that **c'(e\*) = 1**  
> > ○ Setting **s\* = c(e\*)** makes the manager’s surplus **0** (i.e., the manager receives only the wage)

⑷ **2nd best**

> ① **Setting:** instead of observing e directly, the owner can observe the following  
> ② This can be viewed as the following game  
>
> > ○ **Stage 1.** The owner chooses **a** and **b**  
> > ○ **Stage 2.** The manager decides whether to accept the contract (**a constraint appears here**)  
> > ○ **Stage 3.** If the manager accepts, they choose **e**  
>
> ③ **Subgame-perfect equilibrium:** solve by backward induction  
>
> > ○ **Stage 3.** **s = a + bπg = a + be + bε**  
> > ○ **Stage 2. Participation constraint:** since the manager must accept, **U ≥ 0** must hold  
> > ○ **Stage 1.** The owner chooses **a** and **b** so that **U = 0** while maximizing profit  
> > ○ (Reference) Stage 2 creates a constrained problem, but with some math it can be converted to an unconstrained problem  
> > ○ From the manager’s perspective, the required effort in the 2nd best is smaller than in the 1st best  
> > ○ **Interpretation:** because the manager has asymmetric information, they have bargaining power

## **3. Hidden type model:** also called the adverse selection model

⑴ **Overview**

> ① **Definition:** the agent knows their own type but cannot change it, and reflects it in their behavior  
> ② Example: borrowing money from a bank to raise funds

⑵ **Basic assumptions**

> ① **Equation 1. Consumer’s surplus**
>
> > ○ **T:** total payment  
> > ○ **v:** satisfies **v(q) ≥ 0**, **v'(q) ≥ 0**, and **v''(q) < 0**
>
> ② **Equation 2. Parameter θ:** must satisfy **θH > θL**  
> ③ **Equation 3. Seller’s surplus:** also called the seller’s profit

⑶ **1st best:** when the seller knows the consumer’s type θ

> ① **Setting:** the seller offers different contracts depending on the consumer’s type  
> ② **Condition:** participation constraint (the condition for the consumer to participate)  
> ③ Example: **β = 0.5**, **θL = 15**, **θH = 20**, **v(q) = 2q^0.5**, **c = 5**

⑷ **2nd best:** when the seller does not know the consumer’s type θ

> ① **Setting:** since the seller cannot observe θ, the contract is designed so that the consumer self-selects the contract that matches their type  
> ② Consumer’s constraints
>
> > ○ **Condition 1. L’s participation constraint:** for a type-θL consumer to participate  
> > ○ **Condition 2. H’s participation constraint:** for a type-θH consumer to participate  
> > ○ **Condition 3. L’s incentive compatibility constraint:** a type-θL consumer should not choose the contract intended for θH  
> > ○ **Condition 4. H’s incentive compatibility constraint:** a type-θH consumer should not choose the contract intended for θL
>
> ③ The seller’s profit maximization problem
>
> > ○ **Condition 1** can be ignored  
> > ○ If **Condition 2** does not bind (i.e., is not an equality), then a better solution exists  
> >
> > > ○ Let **TL ← TL + ε**, **TH ← TH + ε**  
> > > ○ If ε is small enough, **Condition 1** and **Condition 2** are not violated  
> > > ○ It does not affect **Condition 3** and **Condition 4** (because ε cancels out)  
> > > ○ Expected profit **E(π)** can be increased  
> >
> > ○ If **Condition 4** does not bind (i.e., is not an equality), then a better solution exists  
> >
> > > ○ Let **TH ← TH + ε**  
> > > ○ If ε is small enough, **Condition 4** is not violated  
> > > ○ If ε is small enough, **Condition 2** is not violated  
> > > ○ **Condition 1** and **Condition 3** are satisfied automatically  
> >
> > ○ It is enough to ignore **Condition 3** when solving and then check whether it is satisfied by the solution
>
> ④ **Conclusion:** the problem becomes an unconstrained maximization problem
