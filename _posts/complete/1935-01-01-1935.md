### **1. Overview**

****⑴ Signalling theory**:** Mainly applied to the job market

> ① A worker’s action becomes a signal, allowing the employer to infer the worker’s type.

> ② A sequential version of incomplete information.

>> ○ (Reference) [Contract theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1927) is the simultaneous version of incomplete information.

> ③ Example **:** Education level

>> ○ Education is used as one means to distinguish capable and less capable people.

>> ○ In other words, the fact that someone received education conveys information about ability.

>> ○ Since education is unrelated to real productivity gains, the theory argues that higher education should not lead to higher wages.

⑵ **Stage 1.** The worker’s type is determined by a chance node.

> ① If t = H, the worker is a high-skilled worker.

> ② If t = L, the worker is a low-skilled worker.

⑶ **Stage 2.** After observing their type, the worker chooses E or NE (E **:** education; NE **:** no education).

> ① If the worker chooses E, a type-H worker and a type-L worker incur costs **cH** and **cL**, respectively.

> ② In general, the cost of education for a high-skilled worker is not large.

> ③ If the worker is hired, they receive a wage **w**.

⑷ **Stage 3.** After observing the worker’s choice, the employer decides whether to hire (J) or not hire (NJ).

> ① (Reference) Joint probability

> ② (Reference) Conditional probability

> ③ (Reference) Bayes’ rule (Bayes’ theorem)

> ④ If the employer hires a type-L worker, the payoff is **-w**; if the employer hires a type-H worker, the payoff is **π - w**.

> ⑤ Depending on the specific design of the problem, the information available to the employer can differ.

⑸ Perfect Bayesian equilibrium

> ① Nash equilibrium condition **:** At each information set, players choose actions that maximize their payoffs.

> ② Bayes’ rule **:** Beliefs about types are updated according to Bayes’ rule.

### **2. Separating equilibrium**

****⑴ Overview**:** The case where H and L choose different actions.

⑵ **Step 1.** Worker’s strategy

> ① Assume Pr(E | H) = 1 and Pr(NE | L) = 1.

> ② That is, assume the worker’s strategy is (E | H, NE | L).

> ③ Also assume **cH ≤ w ≤ cL**.

⑶ **Step 2.** Compute the employer’s beliefs.

⑷ **Step 3.** Employer’s best response

> ① Employer’s payoff if the worker chooses E and the employer chooses J

> ② Employer’s payoff if the worker chooses E and the employer chooses NJ

> ③ Employer’s payoff if the worker chooses NE and the employer chooses J

> ④ Employer’s payoff if the worker chooses NE and the employer chooses NJ

> ⑤ Conclusion **:** The employer’s best response to (E | H, NE | L) is (J | E, NJ | NE).

⑸ **Step 4.** Existence of a perfect Bayesian equilibrium

> ① The worker’s best response to (J | E, NJ | NE) is (E | H, NE | L).

>> ○ (Reference) cH ≤ w ≤ cL

>> ○ If a type-H worker deviates to (NE | H, NE | L), their payoff decreases from w - cH to 0.

>> ○ If a type-L worker deviates to (E | H, E | L), their payoff decreases from 0 to w - cL.

> ② Conclusion **:** [(J | E, NJ | NE), (E | H, NE | L)] is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.

⑹ **Step 5.** Uniqueness of the perfect Bayesian equilibrium

> ① Example **:** [(NJ | E, J | NE), (E | L, NE | H)]

>> ○ Given (E | L, NE | H), the employer’s best response is indeed (NJ | E, J | NE).

>> ○ But if a type-L worker deviates to (NE | L, NE | H), their payoff increases from w - cL to 0.

>> ○ Therefore, (E | L, NE | H) is not the worker’s best response to (NJ | E, J | NE).

> ② By checking all cases, one can show that there is no perfect Bayesian equilibrium other than [(J | E, NJ | NE), (E | H, NE | L)].

### **3. Pooling equilibrium**

****⑴ Definition**:** H and L take the same action, so the employer obtains no information.

⑵ **Step 1.** Worker’s strategy

> ① Assume Pr(E | H) = 1 and Pr(E | L) = 1.

> ② That is, assume the worker’s strategy is (E | H, E | L).

> ③ Also assume **cH ≤ cL ≤ w**.

⑶ **Step 2.** Compute the employer’s beliefs.

⑷ **Step 3.** Employer’s best response

> ① Employer’s payoff if the worker chooses E and the employer chooses J

> ② Employer’s payoff if the worker chooses E and the employer chooses NJ

> ③ Employer’s payoff if the worker chooses NE and the employer chooses J

> ④ Employer’s payoff if the worker chooses NE and the employer chooses NJ

> ⑤ Conclusion **:** For the employer’s best response to (E | H, E | L) to be (J | E, NJ | NE), the following condition is needed:

>> ○ (Note) The formula above is a general expression; in this example it is difficult to define Pr(H | NE) immediately.

>> ○ Conclusion **:** A Nash equilibrium exists only if there are sufficiently many type-H workers and the fraction of type-H among the non-educated is sufficiently small.

⑸ **Step 4.** Existence of a perfect Bayesian equilibrium

> ① The worker’s best response to (J | E, NJ | NE) is (E | H, E | L).

>> ○ (Reference) cH ≤ cL ≤ w

>> ○ If a type-H worker deviates to (NE | H, E | L), their payoff decreases from w - cH to 0.

>> ○ If a type-L worker deviates to (E | H, NE | L), their payoff decreases from w - cL to 0.

> ② Conclusion **:** [(J | E, NJ | NE), (E | H, E | L)] is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.

⑹ **Step 5.** Uniqueness of the perfect Bayesian equilibrium **:** In fact, [(J | E, NJ | NE), (E | H, E | L)] is not the only solution.

### **4. Hybrid equilibrium**

****⑴ Definition**:** A mixed strategy is used, so even “noisy” information is conveyed to the employer.

⑵ **Step 1.** Worker’s strategy

> ① A type-H worker always chooses E, while a type-L worker chooses E with probability 0 < e < 1.

> ② That is, assume the worker’s strategy is (E | H, e | L).

> ③ Also assume **cH ≤ cL ≤ w**.

⑶ **Step 2.** Employer’s strategy

> ① The employer chooses J with probability 0 < j < 1, and chooses NJ with probability 1 - j.

> ② That is, assume the employer’s strategy is (j | E, NJ | NE).

⑷ **Step 3.** Compute the employer’s beliefs.

⑸ **Step 4.** Employer’s best response **:** If π(E) > π(NE), then the employer would choose e = 1, and if π(E) < π(NE), then the employer would choose e = 0—so a contradiction.

⑹ **Step 5.** Worker’s best response **:** If π(J) > π(NJ), then the worker would choose j = 1, and if π(J) < π(NJ), then the worker would choose j = 0—so a contradiction.

⑺ **Step 6.** Perfect Bayesian equilibrium

> ① [(j* | E, NJ | NE), (e* | L, E | H)] is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.

> ② (Reference) It is easy to show that the employer’s best response to NE is NJ.

> ③ (Reference) It is easy to show that a type-H worker’s best response to (j* | E, NJ | NE) is E.
