## **1. Overview**

⑴ Institutions **:** the rules of the game

> ① Forces that sustain institutions **:** law, members’ consent, coercive power of privileged groups  
> ② Informal institutions **:** trust, commitment  
> ③ Formal institutions **:** limited-liability companies, etc.

⑵ A yardstick for institutional efficiency

⑶ Positive aspects of institutions

> ① Because institutions are public goods, they can contribute to improving a society’s productivity  
> ② **Example 1.** Money and banking  
> ③ **Example 2.** The welfare state **:** resolves potential market failures in private insurance and capital markets  
> ③ **Example 3.** Private property rights **:** addresses the inefficiency of communal property rights—i.e., the tragedy of the commons

⑷ Negative aspects of institutions

> ① Path dependence **:** the idea that historical context has shaped today’s institutions  
> ② Due to path dependence, irrational institutions can continue to persist

## **2. Case 1. Slavery and Serfdom — focusing on serfdom**

⑴ The emergence of serfdom **:** proposed by Evsey Domar

> ① Serfdom was concentrated in the centuries before and after the year 1000  
>> ○ Serfdom emerged because land was abundant and labor was scarce  
>> ○ When land is abundant, land rent converges to zero unless workers’ freedom of movement is denied  
>> ○ (Note) This is somewhat similar to profits being zero for price-takers under perfect competition  
>> ○ With abundant land, a way to deny or restrict workers’ mobility was serfdom

> ② (Reference) Conditions for the emergence of serfdom  
>> ○ Labor scarcity  
>> ○ A small and declining class of independent peasants  
>> ○ High concentration of land in the hands of the Church and secular elites  
>> ○ Low level of urbanization  
>> ○ Close networks between the Church and secular landlords  
>> ○ A state that cooperates with the aristocracy

> ③ In most of Western Europe, serfdom was voluntarily dissolved in the centuries before the Black Death  
>> ○ Serfdom was abolished because land became scarce and labor became abundant  
>> ○ There had been uninterrupted population growth over several centuries  
>> ○ Landlords could rely on market power, rather than restricting individual rights through command, to extract rents from labor  
>> ○ (Note) Relying on market power can secure higher profits

> ④ **Critique 1.** Under labor scarcity, nobles could not establish dominance over peasants  
>> ○ Under labor scarcity, peasants’ rights over labor increase  
>> ○ It does not explain how a monopsonistic cartel could be maintained for so long when labor was scarce (such cartels are hard to sustain)

> ⑤ **Critique 2.** Historically, the chronology of serfdom’s emergence and decline varied widely  
>> ○ Serfdom emerged only after a considerable time had passed since the fall of the Roman Empire  
>> ○ There were multiple peasant uprisings  
>> ○ Even when coercive elements of serfdom intensified, nobles sometimes yielded to market pressures  
>> ○ Even within small areas, landlords’ coercive power differed greatly  
>> ○ Not only serfdom, but various contracts coexisted  
>> ○ In England, until the late 13th century, about 1/4 of land was under serf tenure; the other 1/4 and 1/2 were freehold land and tenant land, respectively  
>> ○ Sweden and Denmark, with strong peasant self-reliance, did not introduce serfdom

> ⑥ **Supplement 1.** Path dependence of institutions  
>> ○ Serfdom emerged due to contingent initial conditions  
>> ○ Because the pressure for change was not large, serfdom persisted steadily

> ⑦ **Supplement 2.** After the Black Death, lords competed to secure scarce labor, but serfdom could not revive due to urban growth  
>> ○ Europe was largely a closed village system, but cities served as enclaves of freedom  
>> ○ Cities became safe havens for runaway serfs or tenants

⑵ Serfdom and slavery are inefficient institutions, but survived through institutional path dependence

> ① Why serfdom and slavery are inefficient **:** shirking and high monitoring costs  
> ② When one works on one’s own land, shirking and monitoring costs do not arise  
> ③ A landlord’s threat to expel a farmer for poor performance is not credible, so farmers have substantial incentives to shirk  
> ④ Monitoring costs themselves can exceed the surplus value extracted as rent

## **3. Case 2. The Guild System**

⑴ Monopolistic competition and monopoly firms

> ① Monopolistic competition is positive  
>> ○ Because monopolistic competition creates products specialized for particular groups (e.g., luxury goods), earning additional profit is not ethically problematic  
>> ○ Example: large firms such as Samsung and LG deter competitors’ market entry with distinctive technological capabilities

> ② Monopoly firms are negative  
>> ○ Because monopoly firms can abuse their dominant positions, they should be restricted through antitrust law

⑵ Guilds and perfect competition

> ① Without guilds, the market would become perfectly competitive, undermining incentives for technological development  
> ② Historically, the number of market participants was much smaller, so markets were far from perfect competition

## **4. Case 3. Sharecropping Contracts**

⑴ (Reference) Partnership contracts

> ① Limited-liability companies **:** investors are not responsible for losses or debts beyond what is accumulated within the company represented by the shares they own  
> ② Unlimited-liability companies **:** investors bear larger risks, which limits the amount of capital that can be raised

⑵ Sharecropping is an inefficient institution

> ① (Reference) Under a fixed-rent contract **:** once the tenant pays the fixed rent, they can keep all output  
> ② Under a sharecropping contract **:** because the sharecropper receives only a fraction of the marginal product, the incentive to work is reduced  
>> ○ In other words, sharecropping tends to induce underinvestment in labor input  
> ③ In general, sharecropping contracts were the prevailing practice

⑵ **Explanation 1.** Sharecropping existed because it reduced tenants’ risk in bad harvest years  
> ① This explanation is not persuasive because it was customary to defer rent until the tenant had a good harvest

⑶ **Explanation 2.** The output-reducing effect of sharecropping prevents tenants from excessively exploiting the land and degrading soil quality  
> ① This is based on the idea that landlords would suffer in the long run if land became barren  
> ② This is only valid when tenants have short-term contracts  
> ③ In practice, tenants often acquired inheritance rights to leases, so this explanation is not persuasive

⑷ **Explanation 3.** Institutional path dependence  
> ① Initial conditions favored the formation of sharecropping contracts  
> ② Afterwards, pressure to shift to fixed-rent contracts was not strong, and there were costs to changing the system, so sharecropping persisted

## **5. Case 4. Scandinavian Dairy Cooperatives**

⑴ Historical background **:** Scandinavian dairy cooperatives emerged in the late 19th to early 20th century

**Table 1.** Number of cooperative dairy processing plants and privately owned dairy processing plants]

⑵ Why dairy cooperatives emerged in Scandinavia

> ① **Reason 1.** Milk is perishable, so suppliers needed sufficient scale to manage that risk  
> ② **Reason 2.** Attempts to damage milk quality occurred continuously, but there was no established way to standardize quality  
>> ○ A large, well-funded organization was needed to develop technology to standardize milk quality  
>> ○ A trustworthy organization was needed to create reliable quality labels for milk

⑶ Scandinavian dairy cooperatives were an inefficient institution **:** they were a system of horizontal integration

> ① Reason **:** In the late 19th century, there were not many farmers willing to sell their dairy assets and run farms  
> ② This can be explained as an inefficient institution that survived for a long time due to path dependence
