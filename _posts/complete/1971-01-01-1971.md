**1. When did Europe pull ahead?**

⑴ The **California School** argument **:** represented by Kenneth Pomeranz

> ① Europe did not surpass China or India until the late 18th century.

> ② The Industrial Revolution occurred because Europe overcame late-18th-century land constraints through contingent, “lucky” factors.

>> ○ The “luck” of being located close to coal-consuming regions.

>> ○ Importing land-intensive food and agricultural raw materials from the Americas.

>> ○ (Note) This rests on an underlying Malthusian explanation that, basically, there was no technological progress.

⑵ **Empirical findings** **:** inflation must be considered, and the gap in economic level had already been widening before the Industrial Revolution.

> ① Around 1550, the **silver wage** (nominal wage / silver price) in England was higher than in China and India.

>> ○ Along with textiles and spices, silver was a major tradable good, so the law of one price was established.

> ② Around 1550, the **grain wage** (nominal wage / grain price) in England was similar to that in China and India.

>> ○ Grain is a representative non-tradable good, so the law of one price is not established.

>> ○ After 1700, England’s grain wage rises markedly.

> ③ If these data are incorporated into the real-wage deflator, one can say that England’s real wage was higher than that of China and India.

⑶ Backed by the **Maddison Project** based at the University of Groningen, recent estimates are being revised.

> ① The “Great Divergence” between Europe and Asia began long before the Industrial Revolution.

> ② Around **1500** **:** China’s income level was similar to England’s, but far below Italy and the Netherlands.

> ③ Around **1600** **:** China was similar to Europe’s periphery (Sweden and Spain). After that, China’s income level declined further.

> ④ **Explanation 1.** Europe managed the balance between diminishing returns and technological progress much better.

> ⑤ **Explanation 2.** Europe’s custom of late marriage, which reduced fertility, had an important impact.

**2. The Netherlands: the birthplace of the first modern economy**

⑴ **Factor 1.** A culture of thrift **:** status was not a right acquired by birth, but linked to effort.

⑵ **Factor 2.** A spirit of tolerance

> ① It became a safe haven for talented immigrants who had been driven out elsewhere.

> ② Today, Wall Street or Silicon Valley plays a similar role.

⑶ Other features of the Netherlands

> ① Monarchical control **:** unlike England, there was no constitutional control system; it largely served nearby monarchs.

> ② The division of labor was quite advanced, and the non-agricultural sector was large.

> ③ Liberty, [intellectual property institutions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1977), and well-functioning markets.

**3. The British Industrial Revolution** **:** it triggered the Industrial Revolution.

⑴ Characteristics of Britain

> ① The Glorious Revolution (1688–1689) established a constitutional monarchy.

> ② Parliament controlled the monarch’s taxation and the arbitrary granting of privileges.

⑵ The British Industrial Revolution (1770–1830) was not based on scientific discoveries.

> ① From the 17th century, knowledge about the laws of nature was acquired, but it had little influence on production technology.

> ② The steam engine, emblematic of 18th-century invention, is an exception to this rule.

⑶ The content and significance of the new national-income estimates for the Industrial Revolution period by Crafts and Harley

**Table. 1.** New and old estimates of TFP growth and national output growth in Britain (Unit **:** annual percent)]

> ① **Old estimates** **:** results of the pioneering work by W. A. Cole and P. Dean.

> ② **New estimates** **:** results of revisionist economic historians such as N. F. R. Crafts and K. Harley.

>> ○ Total factor productivity (TFP) growth was at almost the same level as the figures for medieval and early modern agriculture.

> ③ **Revision 1.** Rather than a radical, sudden transformation of economic life, there was an industrial transition.

>> ○ Emphasizes that there was not much difference between Britain’s pre-industrial growth and its TFP growth in the early phase of the Industrial Revolution.

>> ○ The estimated per-capita growth rate for 1780–1830—once regarded as the period of industrial “breakthrough”—falls to about one-third of the previous estimate.

>> ○ Total factor productivity growth was at almost the same level as the figures for medieval and early modern agriculture.

> ④ **Revision 2.** Focusing only on Britain obscures the fact that a Europe-wide intellectual enlightenment was underway.

> ⑤ Why the old and new estimates differ

>> ○ Earlier estimates placed too much weight on fast-growing industries relative to “old” industries within total industrial output.

>> ○ The size of the industrial sector within the overall economy was overstated.

⑷ **Principle 1.** The Industrial Enlightenment thesis

> ① Named and argued by Joel Mokyr, who studied the market economy and the “market for ideas.”

> ② Schumpeter also argued that Britain experienced the Industrial Revolution because British society was enlightened.

> ③ Europe, during the 19th century, developed an emerging scientific culture: rational inquiry into the laws of nature.

>> ○ The Industrial Enlightenment transformed the economy in the late 19th century and dominated production technologies for most of the 20th century.

>> ○ The period from 1945 to the mid-1970s is often called capitalism’s “Golden Age”; empirical work suggests that it ended because the scientific and technological revolutions of the late 19th to early 20th centuries had been fully exploited by 1945–mid-1970s.

> ④ Conclusion **:** even if it had not been Britain, the Industrial Revolution would have occurred in another European country.

> ⑤ Critique **:** the fact that the Industrial Revolution happened only in Britain stems from differences between British empiricism and Continental rationalism.

>> ○ British empiricism **:** advocated by Bacon; believed that technological progress could be achieved through empirical research.

>> ○ Continental rationalism **:** represented by Descartes’ *Discourse on the Method* (“I think, therefore I am”).

>> ○ Because technology can be transmitted through learning-by-doing, British empiricism is superior to rationalism.

⑸ **Principle 2.** The Industrious Revolution thesis

> ① Named and argued by Berkeley economic historian Jan de Vries.

> ② Claims that an industrious revolution—a fundamental change in consumer behavior—triggered the Industrial Revolution.

>> ○ Labor industriousness **:** broadly, most family members began participating in the labor market.

>> ○ Even if per-capita income fell under Malthusian forces, the family’s total wages increased.

>> ○ Income gains from increased labor supply erupted into new desires for novel goods.

> ③ Significance

>> ○ **Traditional view** **:** economic levels rose as consumers adapted to new products created by technological innovation.

>> ○ Corrects the producer-centered bias.

> ④ Limits

>> ○ A balanced interpretation of demand and supply is necessary.

>> ○ A reasonable explanation is needed for why most family members came to participate in the labor market.
