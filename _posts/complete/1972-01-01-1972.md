**1.** (Reference) **Monetary system**

⑴ Definition of money

> ① A generally accepted medium

> ② (Reference) A German scholar named Hahn (Hana?) argued for the state theory of money
>
>> ○ A theory that something becomes money because the state defines it as money  
>> ○ Doesn’t fully fit (e.g., the Korean won vs. the U.S. dollar)

> ③ Conditions for money **:** Goods that spoil easily are unlikely to become money

⑵ Money emerges spontaneously

> ① Money is superior to barter in that it makes a “coincidence of wants” possible  
> ② Money increases the volume of exchange itself

⑶ In antiquity, good money encouraged bad money

> ① Only one uniquely “good” bank issued banknotes  
> ② As banking emerged, lenders of last resort also emerged spontaneously

⑷ Gresham’s law **:** In modern times, bad money drives out good (bad money drives out good)

**2.** (Reference) **Banking system**

⑴ Roles of banks

> ① **Type 1.** Lending banking (fractional-reserve banking) **:** Earns profits by using the deposit margin for lending and investment
>
>> ○ Continuously screens and monitors borrowers to recover loans  
>> ○ Nowadays, banks also earn profits by using portfolios of debt securities and marketable securities, not only “capital–deposit–loan” activities  
>> ○ It is not an exaggeration to say banks do business through credit **:** Creating credit means creating money  
>> ○ The gold standard provided an early banking system with a means to create credit

> ② **Type 2.** Deposit banking **:** 100% reserve banking (100 percent reserve banking)
>
>> ○ Safekeeping money from various risks and charging depositors a usage fee

> ③ Banks contribute to economic growth **:** because they increase the efficiency of resource allocation

⑵ Development of banking

> ① Alexander explains that differences in countries’ initial banking conditions later determined whether they became financial powers  
> ② The first banknotes were issued by Stockholm Banco, a Swedish bank led by the Dutch banker Johan Palmstruch
>
>> ○ Stockholm Banco was a deposit bank that borrowed money from the public  
>> ○ Both loans and deposit receipts were issued in the form of banknotes  
>> ○ Banknotes became standardized like modern paper checks, and were preferred over the heavy copper plates then used as a means of payment in Sweden  
>> ○ Its short history (1657–68) ended with a bank run

> ③ Banking in the United Kingdom **:** commercial banking  
> ④ Banking in Germany **:** universal banking (combining commercial and investment banking)
>
>> ○ Unlike the U.K., it can attract long-term investment **:** very important for Germany’s catch-up  
>> ○ **Critique 1.** This logic has not been empirically demonstrated  
>> ○ **Critique 2.** Although the U.K. trades short-term, it is rolled over routinely, so it may be less short-term than it seems

> ⑤ Banking in France **:** universal banking like Germany (as in the notes)

⑶ (Related concept) Usury / moneylending

⑷ (Related concept) Stock market

> ① **Difference 1.** Who collects information  
> ② **Difference 2.** Types of assets handled

> ③ Banks
>
>> ○ Basically perform information acquisition, information distribution, and crisis response  
>> ○ By valuing non-securitized assets, they lend to industries with lower risk and higher returns  
>> ○ In the late 19th century, there were relatively few marketable assets, while a very large share of assets were non-marketable  
>> ○ By the 1950s, almost every household had a bank account  
>> ○ In contrast, only about 10% had a stock account

> ④ Stock markets
>
>> ○ Basically perform information acquisition, information distribution, and crisis response  
>> ○ The public supplies funds for a tiny subset of securitized assets  
>> ○ Efficient Market Hypothesis **:** Using information in the market, can you earn returns higher than the market return? The hypothesis says no
>>>
>>> ○ Hence, the stock market is “efficient” in that sense  
>>> ○ But that does not mean the prices formed in the stock market are rational

> ⑤ Why both banks and stock markets exist
>
>> ○ Even if a bank collects accurate information about a firm, it may not offer a reasonable interest rate  
>> ○ So the stock market can be an alternative

> ⑥ Banking reached a sophisticated level of development earlier than stock markets  
> ⑦ An economy in which firms do not rely entirely on banks, nor entirely on stock markets, may be the best solution

⑸ (Related concept) Foreign exchange market

> ① A reason one can systematically make money in FX markets is that there exists an entity that intervenes systematically

**3. Bank run** (bank-run)

⑴ (Reference) Bank failure

> ① Insolvency crisis **:** when a bank’s liabilities exceed its assets  
> ② Liquidity crisis **:** when assets are temporarily tied up (e.g., long-term loans) so the bank cannot meet depositors’ demand for funds

⑵ Bank runs occur as self-fulfilling prophecies

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. A bank takes deposits and promises depositors the right to withdraw at a positive interest rate and a fixed nominal value  
> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. The bank provides borrowers loans at a fixed nominal value, but evaluating future value is difficult, so it sometimes miscalculates  
> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Borrowers cannot repay, and depositors rush to withdraw out of fear that they will not be able to retrieve their deposits
>
>> ○ If depositors begin withdrawing because they think a bank run will occur, a bank run occurs (self-fulfilling)  
>> ○ Depositors usually do not know what bankers do inside the bank, and they tend to be loss-averse, so they have an incentive to withdraw as quickly as possible

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. The bank faces liquidity constraints; without a central bank as lender of last resort, it fails  
> ⑤ When there is no central bank, a bank run is also a way for depositors to “punish” a bank  
> ⑥ The early history of banking is a history of frequent failures
>
>> ○ Banks tended to hold too small a portion of deposits as reserves

⑶ **Preventive measure 1.** Deposit insurance

> ① A system that prevents bank runs by having an insurance corporation pay depositors (up to a limit) even if a bank fails
>
>> ○ Restores the public’s willingness to save at banks  
>> ○ Domestic saving positively affects domestic investment, so it may also have growth-promoting effects  
>> ○ From the public’s perspective, adopting deposit insurance after the Great Depression was beneficial  
>> ○ In Korea, deposit insurance applies up to 50 million KRW

> ② **Limit 1.** By making supervision and capital monitoring looser, it can make banks more adventurous and less careful
>
>> ○ There is evidence of this

> ③ **Limit 2.** Non-deposit institutions can also trigger bank runs
>
>> ○ Nowadays, beyond lending/investing via deposit margins, portfolios in debt securities and marketable securities are also substantial  
>> ○ Close relationships between non-deposit financial institutions and banks have become prominent  
>> ○ Example **:** (as written in the notes) Bank of America failed because a non-deposit institution caused a bank run

⑷ **Preventive measure 2.** Relationship banking **:** Sending one banker to serve on each firm’s board (mainly Germany)

> ① The bank learns internal information about the company  
> ② Benefit to the bank **:** Less risk of lending to an unsound firm  
> ③ Benefit to the firm **:** Even if a sound firm temporarily faces a liquidity crisis, it is not difficult to obtain funding from the bank

⑸ **Preventive measure 3.** Bank holiday **:** Temporarily suspending bank operations (about 7 days) to restrain withdrawals and prevent bank runs

⑹ No institutional innovation can eradicate financial crises

> ① The fate of fractional-reserve banking, which holds only part of deposits as reserves and lends out the rest
>
>> ○ Reason **:** Banks invest today’s value into future value, so there is uncertainty

> ② What an individual financial institution calls “innovation” often tends to increase systemic financial-crisis risk while capturing private profits
>
>> ○ Therefore, finance should be regulated appropriately  
>> ○ Looking at history, there were many financial bubbles, and bubbles ultimately burst

**4. Central banking system**

⑴ (Reference) The era of free banking (free banking society) **:** a period with no central bank

⑵ Most central banks formed in the late 19th century were modifications of private banks such as the Bank of England or the Banque de France

⑶ **Function 1.** Lender of last resort

> ① Historically, central banks did not perform the lender-of-last-resort role well  
> ② This is related to “too big to fail” bailout finance discussed below

⑷ **Function 2.** Bank supervision

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. For some time after their emergence, central banks supervised multiple banks  
> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. At first, they thought each country would have at most 5–6 banks maintaining an oligopolistic market  
> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. After World War II, when banks merged into larger units, most became “too big to fail”  
> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. If a too-big-to-fail bank fails, the national economy can be shaken  
> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Too-big-to-fail bailout finance **:** The central bank, acting as lender of last resort, rescues a too-big-to-fail bank before it fails
>
>> ○ Then such bailouts began to operate not only for liquidity crises but also for too-big-to-fail banks that were insolvent

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. Bankers pursue “high risk, high yield” and try to push business forward while taking excessive risk
>
>> ○ Reason **:** If successful, investors earn higher profits and bankers receive larger bonuses

⑸ **Function 3.** Banknote issuance

> ① Under the gold standard, “hard money” was limited by the quantity of gold coins, so a banking system capable of creating credit was important  
> ② After the gold standard was abolished, the central bank’s money-issuing power became even more important
