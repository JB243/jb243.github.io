**1. Theories that explain the gains from trade**

 ⑴ Theory of comparative advantage **:** Proposed by David Ricardo (1772–1823)

> ① (Note) Ricardo considered capital to be the source of growth.

> ② Assumption **:** Countries trade in order to obtain the benefits of their comparative advantage.

>> ○ Absolute advantage **:** The ability to produce the same good with a smaller amount of inputs than another producer.

>> ○ Comparative advantage **:** The ability to produce the same good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer.

**Figure. 2.** Opportunity costs of meat and potatoes]

**Figure. 3.** Expansion of consumption possibilities through trade]

> ③ Clarification **:** What matters is not whether one country produces something better than another country, but whether it produces it better *relative to other goods*.

> ④ If a country produces the good it is relatively better at and trades for goods it is relatively worse at producing, gains from trade arise.

 ⑵ Heckscher–Ohlin theorem

> ① In the early 20th century, Ricardo’s theory was refined by Sweden’s Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin.

> ② Comparative advantage is based not on differences in labor productivity, but on the relative abundance of factors of production.

>> ○ A country abundant in capital exports capital-intensive goods such as manufactured products.

>> ○ A country abundant in land exports land-intensive goods such as agricultural products.

> ③ **Application 1.** Factor price equalization theorem **:** Did not gain much support.

> ④ **Application 2.** Rybczynski’s theorem **:** Fits most cases well.

>> ○ If the amount of labor increases, labor-intensive industries grow; if the amount of land increases, land-intensive industries grow.

>> ○ **Example 1.** Immigration or population growth promotes the production of manufactured goods.

>> ○ **Example 2.** An increase in land supply promotes the production of agricultural goods.

>>> ○ In 1948, a gold rush occurred in the United States.

>>> ○ Most Americans did not become rich and settled there because they could not even afford the fare to return.

>>> ○ However, the soil quality was so good that it became a breadbasket region.

> ⑤ **Application 3.** Stolper–Samuelson theorem (see below)

> ⑥ Limitation **:** Not only factor endowments but also protection policies played an important role.

>> ○ The United States and Canada export many primary products but not many manufactured goods.

>> ○ U.S. imports include many primary products, but compared with the United Kingdom they are fewer.

>> ○ One reason U.S. manufactured imports were not large was also the influence of protectionist policy.

 ⑶ Krugman’s New Trade Theory

> ① Develops the classical theory of Adam Smith.

> ② Even if production technology and factor endowments are similar, gains from trade arise if each side specializes by industry.

> ③ Limitation **:** The gains from trade through specialization are not a sustained source of growth; they are only temporary gains.

**2. Theories that explain why protectionism emerged despite gains from trade**

 ⑴ Stolper–Samuelson theorem **:** A theory that **explains protectionism**

> ① If comparative advantage lies in capital goods, agricultural products will be imported and capital goods will be exported.

> ② People who produce capital goods domestically will benefit.

> ③ Those who produce agricultural products will see prices fall due to imports and will be forced onto a path of decline.

> ④ **Conclusion 1.** Goods with low productivity due to lack of resources/factors are imported, so domestic producers of those goods lose.

> ⑤ **Conclusion 2.** Gains from trade exist, but they are not enjoyed equally by everyone.

 ⑵ Endogenous growth theory (New growth theory) **:** Another theory that **explains protectionism**

> ① Why do scientists develop technology?

>> ○ To accumulate wealth by obtaining patents.

>> ○ Reputation also plays a significant role **:** “Great ideas” or general-purpose technologies such as the theory of relativity cannot be patented, yet are extremely important.

> ② Why do capitalists invest in technological development?

>> ○ Factors of production such as labor and capital can beinvested into R&D or production processes, thereby inducing technological innovation.

>> ○ Recognizing that the source of current growth lies in innovation, the amount of capital invested into innovation has been increasing.

> ③ Trade can also contribute to growth by expanding market size.

> ④ However, it can suppress growth if it reduces the source of monopoly profits or prevents the recovery of benefits from technological development.

> ⑤ Patent law is emerging as an alternative, as it provides one incentive for investing in R&D.

**3. The rise of protectionism in the 1870s and the collapse of international trade in the interwar period**

 ⑴ This can be explained by the Stolper–Samuelson theorem.

 ⑵ The rise of protectionism in the 1870s

> ① Significance of the 1870s

>> ○ Before the 1870s, only the United Kingdom had completed the Industrial Revolution.

>> ○ After the 1870s, the era of competition among multiple industrial countries began.

>> ○ Notably, Germany and the United States pursued protectionism.

> ② European countries other than the UK shifted to protectionist policies within about 20 years starting in the 1870s.

> ③ Cheap grain imports from the United States led landlords to campaign for agricultural protection.

>> ○ In Germany, the so-called “iron and rye” alliance provided protection to both industry and agriculture.

>> ○ (Note) Tariff rates were not high; tariff revenue was even lower than before 1850, and did not exceed 10% even in Germany and France.

> ④ The U.S. case

>> ○ Landlords benefited from free trade, but manufacturing interests advocated protection.

>> ○ Early 1860s Civil War **:** To finance the war effort, fiscal revenue needed to increase, which led to higher tariffs.

>> ○ Early U.S. government **:** Because government revenue was needed, protectionist policy was sometimes pursued intentionally.

>> ○ The Civil War

>>> ○ Pre-war U.S. South **:** Produced cotton and sold it to the UK; favored free trade.

>>> ○ Pre-war U.S. North **:** Pursued self-reliant industrialization for industries competing with the UK; favored protectionism.

>>> ○ Although the North’s per-capita GDP was much lower than the South’s, the North won the war.

>>> ○ **Reason 1.** The coalition allied with the North was larger than the coalition allied with the South **:** i.e., the North had a larger population.

>>> ○ **Reason 2.** The trade blockade policy was more fatal to the South.

>>> ○ The victorious Northern states with emerging industries chose to protect domestic industry rather than the export-oriented agriculture of Southern cotton and tobacco producers.

 ⑶ The collapse of international trade in the interwar period

> ① (Note) Interwar period **:** The era in which trade was dismantled through World War I and the Great Depression.

> ② (Note) Even in the interwar period, the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands remained trading nations.

> ③ Even before World War I, protectionist sentiment was growing worldwide.

>> ○ There was also a sense of moral unease about protecting and promoting domestic industry at the expense of foreign competitors.

> ④ Free trade lasted only until the 1920s, and after experiencing war, countries became more protectionist.

>> ○ (Note) During the war, food tariffs decreased in most countries.

> ⑤ During World War I, agricultural output increased and an agricultural depression appeared **:** the situation of farmers in the U.S. worsened.

>> ○ This happened because demand for food in Europe was high, leading non-European regions to produce a great deal of food.

> ⑥ In 1930, the United States enacted the Smoot–Hawley Act, imposing trade-prohibitive tariffs on nearly 2,000 goods.

>> ○ As a result, tariff rates became very high by the mid-1930s.

>> ○ It was politicians begging for votes, not a system that benefited farmers.

>> ○ It did not greatly affect meeting domestic demand, so it did not have a large impact on the United States itself.

> ⑦ Because the Smoot–Hawley Act reduced the sense of moral unease about protectionism, other countries also took retaliatory tariff measures.

>> ○ In 1932, the UK created an imperial preference tariff system.

>> ○ Canada also took retaliatory measures.

>> ○ Later, people began to recognize that the Smoot–Hawley Act was a bad law.

> ⑧ In the 1930s, combined with the gold standard, the Great Depression broke out and thinking reverted to mercantilism.

> ⑨ Consequences of the collapse of international trade

>> ○ In real terms, world trade fell, and in almost all countries the ratio of exports to GDP also fell.

>> ○ The trade–income ratio did not recover to its pre-1913 level until 1960.

>> ○ This is noteworthy because from 1850, trade had been growing faster than the annual growth rate of per-capita income.

**4. Limitations of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem**

 ⑴ It is not easy to create a good measure of the degree of protection.

> ① A representative measure currently used is the share of imports among the goods on which tariffs are imposed.

> ② Consider a country that imposes a 20% tariff on all goods versus a country that imposes a 50% tariff on only one good.

>> ○ Clearly, the former is more protectionist, but the measure would be larger for the latter.

 ⑵ The relationship between protection and the growth rate is not simple.

> ① Before World War II **:** growth rates and tariff rates were positively correlated.

>> ○ Reason **:** The representative high-tariff countries were the United States and Germany.

> ② After World War II **:** growth rates and tariff rates were negatively correlated.

> ③ The relationship between protection and growth cannot be explained theoretically alone; it must be understood in historical and political context.

>> ○ Because a uniform relationship between the degree of protection and growth cannot be set, controversies have continued.

>> ○ Gains from trade such as specialization and paths of technology transfer certainly exist.

>> ○ Trade can also weaken the source or incentives for R&D investment, so protection can be advantageous in some respects.

>> ○ Proper protection may be beneficial.

>> ○ Extreme protection clearly produces disastrous outcomes.

 ⑶ The pattern of protectionism may differ by industry.

> ① Protecting competitive infant industries can contribute to growth.

> ② Protecting uncompetitive declining industries does not contribute to growth.
