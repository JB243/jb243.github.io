**1. Overview**

⑴ The need for an international monetary system **:** The same reason money is needed in general—i.e., a coincidence of wants.

⑵ National income accounting identity

> ① **Y:** National output  
> ② **C:** Private consumption  
> ③ **I:** Investment  
> ④ **G:** Government consumption  
> ⑤ **NX:** Net exports  
> ⑥ **S:** National saving  
> ⑦ **Current account deficit:** When net exports are negative. Because **I** is large, the economy is borrowing investment funds from abroad.  
> ⑧ **Current account surplus:** When net exports are positive. Because **I** is small, the economy is investing abroad.  
> ⑨ (Reference) A current account surplus is not necessarily “good” in all cases.  
> ⑩ Without an international monetary system, domestic investment and domestic saving are identically equal (**S = I**).

⑶ The trilemma (trilemma) of an open economy **:** Explains the *absolute* stability of a regime.

> ① **Choice 1.** Exchange rate fixity  
>> ○ A fixed exchange rate is advantageous because there is no uncertainty.  
>> ○ A fixed exchange rate is disadvantageous because when capital mobility is free, it becomes difficult to conduct monetary policy by adjusting interest rates.  
>> ○ A floating exchange rate can be advantageous because it can help resolve a trade deficit.  
>> ○ A floating exchange rate is disadvantageous because it involves uncertainty.  
>> ○ Today, floating exchange rates are dominant **:** Floating exchange rates are not as bad as one might think.

> ② **Choice 2.** Unlimited capital mobility

> ③ **Choice 3.** Monetary policy autonomy

> ④ The open-economy trilemma **:** Holds well in an open economy.  
>> ○ (Reference) **Dilemma:** A problem of giving up one of two values.  
>> ○ (Reference) **Trilemma:** A problem of giving up one of three values.  
>> ○ Proposed by Obstefeld and Taylor.  
>> ○ You can choose only two among exchange rate fixity, unlimited capital mobility, and monetary policy autonomy.

⑷ Commitment, trust, and symmetry **:** Explain the *relative* stability of a regime—i.e., how strong the forces for change are.

**2. The Classical Gold Standard**

⑴ The emergence of the gold standard

> ① Gold has been used as money since ancient times.  
> ② The gold standard as an institution began with the United Kingdom’s Resumption Act of 1819.  
> ③ Newton’s “great mistake” played a role in Britain’s adoption of the gold standard.  
>> ○ Newton briefly served as the Master of the Mint in Europe and had to set the mint ratio between gold and silver; he set the price of gold too high.  
> ④ Japan adopted a silver standard after the Meiji Restoration, then acquired a large amount of gold after winning the First Sino–Japanese War and introduced the gold standard.  
> ⑤ Korea naturally adopted the gold standard after coming under Japanese rule in 1905 **:** At the time, China was still on a silver standard.

⑵ The emergence of the international gold standard

> ① Britain emerged as an economic powerhouse and drew other countries into Britain’s gold standard.  
> ② From 1865, European countries formed the Latin Monetary Union (LMU), which encouraged the emergence of the international gold standard.  
> ③ From the late 19th century to World War I was the era of the international gold standard.

⑶ The open-economy trilemma

> ① The gold standard is basically a fixed exchange rate system **:** If the exchange rate is not constant, allowing gold convertibility enables risk-free arbitrage.  
> ② It fixed the exchange rate and allowed unlimited capital mobility at the cost of sacrificing monetary autonomy.  
>> ○ Thus, under the gold standard, governments generally took a laissez-faire approach to economic policy.  
>> ○ Reason **:** They believed in the price–specie–flow mechanism proposed by Hume in 1752.  
>> ○ **Case 1.** If gold flows into Britain, the value of Britain’s money rises, and gold flows back out abroad.  
>> ○ **Case 2.** If Britain accumulates a lot of foreign currency, gold flows into Britain, and the money supply and price level restore equilibrium.

⑷ Limitations

> ① **Limitation 1.** In practice, sterilization policy occurred frequently **:** That is, unlimited capital mobility was not actually allowed.  
>> ○ Central banks worried more about gold losses than about gold gains.  
>> ○ The Bank of England used active interest rate policy to prevent gold losses.  

> ② **Limitation 2.** Under the gold standard, the scale of credit is limited by the amount of gold, so purchasing power cannot expand elastically.  
>> ○ Banks create credit by taking deposits, keeping part as reserves, and lending the rest.  
>> ○ This method resolves the liquidity constraint that the gold standard fundamentally has.  

> ③ **Limitation 3.** The cost of storing gold is quite high.

> ④ Despite **Limitation 1**, the gold standard persisted due to **commitment**, **trust**, and **symmetry**.

⑸ Outcome **:** When monetary policy became important due to political and social change, the international gold standard regime collapsed.

> ① During World War I, the gold standard was temporarily suspended.  
>> ○ Governments financed themselves by expanding the money supply through bond issuance or by printing money.  
>> ○ In Germany’s case, money was printed after the war as well to finance reconstruction.  

> ② The United States, which benefited from the wartime boom, returned to the gold standard in 1919.  
> ③ Britain returned to the gold standard in 1925 after the war ended.  
> ④ Excessive obsession with the gold standard caused the Great Depression.  
>> ○ The U.S. expected that abandoning the gold standard would reduce the dollar’s value.  
>> ○ The U.S. and France held 70% of the world’s gold **:** Other countries could not even issue currency.  
>> ○ As holders began converting dollars into gold, dollar liquidity started to decline.  
>> ○ Combined with a deflation shock, banks began to fail.  

> ⑤ After the Great Depression began, countries that could not maintain the gold standard abandoned it **:** The gold standard collapsed in a self-fulfilling way.  
>> ○ It was expected that if the gold standard were abandoned, money could not be converted into gold, and thus the money’s value would fall further.  
>> ○ As moves to convert into gold increased, the gold standard kept shrinking.  
>> ○ When Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931, other countries began to follow.  

> ⑥ After abandoning the gold standard, economies began to recover quickly from the Great Depression.  
>> ○ Rapid devaluation freed them from the shackles of an overvalued currency.  

> ⑦ When the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1933, the dollar’s value did not fall.  
>> ○ In other words, it was effectively allowing a floating exchange rate in 1933.  
>> ○ Because uncertainty disappeared.  

> ⑧ France abandoned the gold standard relatively late, in 1936.  
>> ○ If France had abandoned it earlier, it might have overtaken the British economy.  
>> ○ Persson argues that if France had abandoned the gold standard earlier, the Popular Front would not have taken power.  
>> ○ Reason France abandoned it late **:** It pursued sterilization policy and held a lot of gold.

**3. The Bretton Woods System**

⑴ The emergence of the Bretton Woods system

> ① In July 1944, 44 countries signed the IMF Articles of Agreement at Bretton Woods in the United States.  
> ② The dollar was fixed to the price of gold **:** 35 dollars per ounce.  
> ③ All currencies were fixed in value against the dollar **:** With **N − 1** exchange rates given.

⑵ The open-economy trilemma

> ① It fixed currencies to the U.S. dollar and allowed monetary policy, at the cost of restricting capital mobility.

⑶ Demise **:** It lacked commitment, credibility, and symmetry.

> ① Lack of commitment  
>> ○ Although capital mobility was restricted, speculators could circumvent it.  

> ② Lack of credibility  
>> ○ In the 1960s, the U.S. Democratic administrations ran budget deficits and pursued expansionary monetary policy, causing the dollar to become overvalued.  
>> ○ Mainly due to expanded welfare spending and the Vietnam War.  
>> ○ In 1971, the dollar was devalued against gold, and in 1973 gold convertibility was abandoned.  
>> ○ At the time, the guarantee of the dollar’s value had so little credible basis that it was said to rest on “faith in God.”  

> ③ Lack of symmetry  
>> ○ Countries other than the United States were not issuers of the key currency, so they could not freely conduct monetary policy.  
>> ○ Even very wealthy countries could conduct monetary policy only within a limited scope.  
>> ○ As a result, the risk of a fundamentally self-fulfilling currency crisis always existed.

> ④ When it became impossible to suppress capital mobility due to the growth of world trade and other pressures, the Bretton Woods system collapsed.

**4. The Post–Bretton Woods System**

⑴ The open-economy trilemma

> ① A regime that abandoned fixed exchange rates and accepted floating exchange rates.  
> ② It allows unlimited capital mobility and free monetary policy.  
> ③ Some countries still peg their currencies, but a worldwide fixed exchange rate system is a thing of the past.

⑵ Optimum Currency Area (OCA) theory **:** Proposed in the 1960s by Robert Mundell and others.

> ① Economies of scale in currency **:** Using a single currency produces the same effect as a fixed exchange rate.  
>> ○ If the same currency is used, there is no risk from exchange rate fluctuations and no transaction fees.  
>> ○ The economy can be stabilized with a single monetary policy **:** Tighten policy when overheated, or inject money to support recovery.

> ② Diseconomies of scale in currency  
>> ○ Economic shocks are asymmetric, and political preferences differ across countries.  
>> ○ A single monetary policy may strongly conflict with the needs of a particular region or country.  
>> ○ Therefore, it is difficult for countries to survive in a fixed exchange rate system whose members are highly diverse.

> ③ A currency union can succeed only if members meet conditions within an appropriate geographic scope.  
>> ○ That geographic scope is called the criterion for an optimum currency area.  
>> ○ That is, geographic conditions under which business cycles propagate so that members are inevitably exposed to the same cycle.

⑶ Overcoming asymmetry in a currency union

> ① First criterion **:** Proposed by Robert Mundell  
>> ○ The importance of labor mobility  
>> ○ If factor mobility is free, equilibrium is restored without exchange rate or price changes.

> ② Second criterion **:** Proposed by Peter Kenen  
>> ○ Production diversification and similar trade structures  
>> ○ Economic shocks would have only limited impact and could help reduce asymmetry.

> ③ Third criterion **:** Proposed by Robert McKinnon  
>> ○ Trade openness among countries  
>> ○ With the law of one price prevalent, the real exchange rate will equalize whether or not a country participates in the currency union.

⑷ The emergence of the Eurozone

> ① Adoption of a currency union **:** As an extreme form of fixed exchange rates, exchange rates are abolished together.  
> ② Endogenous hypothesis **:** Predicts that once a currency union is formed, the movement of labor, goods, and capital becomes smoother, transforming the region into an optimum currency area.  
> ③ The European sovereign debt crisis following the 2007–2008 U.S. financial crisis revealed that Europe had not become an optimum currency area.  
>> ○ Rather, it created many regions that were inevitably more exposed to fiscal crises.  
>> ○ PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain) are in a poor state because they lack borrowing capacity, so there would be no default.  
>> ○ But because they borrow and spend using the Eurozone’s credit, a crisis occurs.

> ④ The European Union can be exited (e.g., Brexit), but the Eurozone cannot be exited **:** It is designed that way.  
>> ○ If countries such as Greece had monetary sovereignty, they could reduce the value of their own currency to overcome a crisis.  
>> ○ Example **:** During the IMF crisis, Korea lowered the exchange rate to around 800 won per 1 U.S. dollar.  
>> ○ Exiting the Eurozone would require enduring an enormous financial shock, and there is effectively no country that can withstand it.  
>> ○ Paul Krugman predicted this from the time the Eurozone was created.
