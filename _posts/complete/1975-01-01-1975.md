## **Lecture 8. The Advantage of Backwardness (Latecomer Advantage)**

Recommended post **:** 【Economic History】 [Economic History Table of Contents](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1967)

**1.** Catch-up

**2.** Why does Germany overtake the United Kingdom?

**1\. Catch-up** **:** Catching up—i.e., a less-developed country using the advantage of backwardness to follow and catch up with advanced countries.

 ⑴ Great divergence **:** Right after the Industrial Revolution, the economic gap between advanced and less-developed countries widened.

 ⑵ Great convergence **:** Since the mid-1990s, the economic levels of advanced and less-developed countries have been converging.

 ⑶ **Cause 1.** Technology transfer

> ① Before 1945 **:** Advanced countries were wary of people from less-developed countries coming to learn technology.

> ② After 1945 **:** Advanced countries became more friendly toward people from less-developed countries coming to learn technology.

>> ○ **Trigger 1.** Marshall Plan **:** As the Cold War system took shape, the United States began rebuilding devastated advanced countries.

>> ○ **Trigger 2.** The United States tried to form a pro-American bloc/line to exert political influence.

>> ○ **Trigger 3.** Standardization of technology and (U.S.) leadership

> ③ Today, there are also moves to prevent brain drain and capital outflow.

>> ○ China is heavily involved in the shift toward a more protective and defensive stance.

>> ○ Example **:** In 5G, China’s capabilities have reached the world’s top level.

 ⑷ **Cause 2.** Convergence through structural change

> ① In advanced countries, productivity across the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors is relatively balanced.

> ② Less-developed countries can raise productivity by reallocating resources.

> ③ In such cases, institutions must support the process.

 ⑸ **Cause 3.** Lenin’s logic

> ① Advanced countries have abundant capital and low profits, while less-developed countries have little capital and high profits—so capital moves from advanced countries to less-developed countries.

> ② A logic used to justify imperialism

 ⑹ Rebuttals to Lenin’s logic

> ① **Rebuttal 1.** According to Lucas, capital can move from less-developed countries to advanced countries (e.g., appropriation/stealing of advanced-country technology).

> ② **Rebuttal 2.** With agglomeration effects and economies of scale, having more capital can lead to higher profits.

**2\. Why did Germany overtake the United Kingdom?**

 ⑴ The catch-up mechanism may have been at work.

 ⑵ The United Kingdom’s special characteristics

> ① The UK was treated as the “sick man of Europe” after the British Empire, but began to prosper after becoming a member of the European Union.

> ② Human capital **:** For economic growth, human capital is more important than physical capital.

>> ○ In the late 19th century, the UK’s academic development centered more on economics than on the hard sciences (i.e., natural sciences).

>> ○ Because finance was developed, the UK pursued high-interest-rate policies, which suppressed manufacturing that required capital investment.

>> ○ Only in the 1970s did the UK begin large-scale investment in the natural sciences.

> ③ Physical capital

>> ○ **Factor 1.** The UK industrialized around the cotton textile industry **:** From the perspective of the 20th century, cotton textiles were a declining industry.

>>> ○ (Note) Spinning **:** Making cotton yarn from cotton; contributed to productivity improvements of 40–50× or more.

>>> ○ (Note) Weaving **:** Making cloth from yarn; could be competitive if labor is low-wage.

>>> ○ (Note) “Bangjeok topo” (spinning topo) **:** Making cotton cloth from British cotton yarn using a hand-spinning device.

>> ○ **Factor 2.** In the late 19th century, the UK had little home bias.

>>> ○ By the late 19th century, the UK was the center of global finance.

>>> ○ Home bias **:** Having more information about the domestic market.

>>> ○ British newspapers at the time had information only on things like the international rates of return in the U.S. and Argentina.

>>> ○ Roughly half of the content was information about foreign government bonds, so investment in the domestic market did not actually take place.

>>> ○ Capital stock per employee **:** In 1917, the UK was 1/3 of the U.S.; in 1950, it was 60%.

 ⑶ Germany’s special characteristics

> ① Over the entire period 1873–1973, Germany’s economic growth rate was higher than the UK’s, and also higher than the U.S.’s.

> ② Human capital **:** For economic growth, human capital is more important than physical capital.

>> ○ **Factor 1.** Germany had strong natural sciences, with engineering schools thriving in the late 19th century.

>> ○ **Factor 2.** Germany had many monopolistic cartel firms.

>>> ○ Under perfect competition, profits are zero, so firms cannot invest in technological development.

>>> ○ Under monopoly/oligopoly, technological development is active to maintain a “super-gap” (large lead) that deters entry by other firms.

>> ○ **Factor 3.** Unlike the UK, industry-wide unions in Germany and Scandinavia were advantageous for technological development.

>>> ○ (Note) Company unions **:** The Japanese model; Korea also follows this.

> ③ Physical capital

>> ○ **Factor 1.** Germany industrialized based on heavy and chemical industries **:** Heavy and chemical industries can continue to develop.

>> ○ **Factor 2.** German banks provided a “canal” (investment channel/flow) through which heavy and chemical industries could be financed.

>>> ○ (Note) Korea is also investing very heavily in R&D.

 ⑷ (Reference) The United States

> ① Human capital

>> ○ **Factor 1.** The U.S. performed well in literacy, school enrollment, and human-capital investment.

>> ○ **Factor 2.** In the U.S., it was common for engineers/technologists to also take on management roles.

>>> ○ (Note) Even before 1930, it was common for white-collar workers to employ blue-collar workers.

> ② Physical capital

>> ○ The U.S. industrialized based on heavy and chemical industries **:** Heavy and chemical industries can continue to develop.

 ⑸ (Reference) Why did industry develop into large-scale management, while agriculture remained household-scale production?

> ① Agriculture

>> ○ Nature dictates the conditions and speed of production.

>> ○ Agricultural labor is difficult to monitor (**∵** it is hard to evaluate until harvest).

> ② Industry

>> ○ Because it is limited only by human ingenuity, economies of scale are larger.

>> ○ It is easier to monitor work effort.
