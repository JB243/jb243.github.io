### **1. Basic characteristics of economics**

⑴ All economic agents are assumed to be rational (self-interested).

⑵ Economics is fundamentally a “cold” discipline **:** because it studies the selfish economic actor (_homo economicus_).

⑶ The lineage (intellectual tradition) of economics

**Figure 1. Lineage of Economics**

> ① A. Smith (1776) → D. Ricardo (1817) + T. Malthus (1789)
>
> ② D. Ricardo (1817) → J. S. Mill (1847) + K. Marx (1867)
>
> ③ The invisible hand
>
> > ○ J. S. Mill (1847) → L. Walras, A. Marshall (1890) (Neoclassical school)
> >
> > ○ L. Walras, A. Marshall (1890), T. Malthus (1789) → J. M. Keynes (1936) (Keynesianism)
> >
> > ○ J. M. Keynes (1936), L. Walras, A. Marshall (1890) → mainstream economics, free-market economics
>
> ④ Labor theory of value
>
> > ○ K. Marx (1867) → V. Lenin (1914) (socialism) → radical economics

⑷ Classification of economics

> ① [Perfectly competitive markets](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1900) and imperfectly competitive markets: complete information theory (large scale)
>
> ② [Contract theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1927): simultaneous incomplete information theory (small scale)
>
> ③ [Signaling](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1935): sequential incomplete information theory (small scale)
>
> ④ [Game theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1914) provides the mathematics used to explain these.

### **2. The subject matter of economics**

⑴ Flow and stock

> ① Flow **:** something whose quantity must be measured over a period of time (e.g., quantity demanded, income, consumption, investment, etc.)
>
> ② Stock **:** something whose quantity must be measured at a point in time (e.g., wealth/assets, money supply)

⑵ Resources

> ① Resources in a broad sense
>
> ② Resources in a narrow sense **:** factors of production
>
> > ○ Labor
> >
> > ○ Capital
> >
> > ○ Land
> >
> > ○ Recently, entrepreneurial effort is also increasingly regarded as a factor of production.

⑶ Products

> ① Definition **:** an item that becomes an object of people’s desires and is bought and sold in the market
>
> ② If it is visible, it is called a good; if it is not visible, it is called a service.
>
> ③ Free goods and economic goods
>
> > ○ Free goods **:** goods that can be enjoyed in any amount without conscious effort
> >
> > ○ Economic goods **:** goods that can be obtained only by paying a price
>
> ④ Consumer goods and capital goods
>
> > ○ Consumer goods **:** goods directly consumed in daily life to satisfy human wants
> >
> > ○ Capital goods **:** goods used to produce consumer goods (machines, buildings, etc.)

⑷ Cost

> ① Accounting cost **:** the amount spent in monetary form
>
> ② Opportunity cost **:** includes even those items that have the character of a cost despite not being an actual monetary outlay
>
> > ○ Among what is given up to make a choice, the most valuable thing
> >
> > ○ Example **:** If choosing to attend university means giving up Job A (₩1,000,000/month) and Job B (₩2,000,000/month), the opportunity cost is ₩2,000,000/month.
> >
> > ○ If you open a restaurant, you assess profit and loss by considering not only accounting profit but also the salary you could have earned at another job.
> >
> > ○ Economics uses the concept of opportunity cost because the thought “Should I do this work for this money?” can restrain entry into an industry.
>
> ③ Sunk cost **:** a cost that, once spent, cannot be recovered regardless of what choice is made afterward
>
> > ○ In reality, people often make irrational choices because they fixate on sunk costs.
> >
> > ○ The opportunity cost related to a sunk cost is 0.
> >
> > ○ Example **:** the Concorde fallacy

⑸ Price

> ① Roles of price **:** conveying signals, providing incentives, and distributing income
>
> ② Price mechanism **:** A. Smith argued that the invisible hand determines prices.

### **3. The basic structure of the national economy**

⑴ Three major economic agents

> ① Households **:** consume goods and supply factors of production
>
> ② Firms **:** supply goods and purchase factors of production
>
> ③ Government **:** levies taxes and carries out various projects

⑵ Three major markets

> ① Product market
>
> > ○ Payments for goods flow from households to firms.
> >
> > ○ Goods and services flow from firms to households.
>
> ② Labor market
>
> > ○ Labor flows from households to firms.
> >
> > ○ Wages flow from firms to households.
>
> ③ Capital market
>
> > ○ Capital flows from households to firms.
> >
> > ○ Rent, interest, and profits flow from firms to households.

⑶ Major types of economies

> ① Market economy **:** an economy in which the market is the center of all economic activity
>
> > ○ The prices of all goods are determined in the market.
> >
> > ○ Establishment of property rights, allowance of free competition, and guarantee of free trade
>
> ...
>
> ② Command economy **:** an economy that is mainly driven by government control
>
> ③ Mixed economy **:** the government intervenes to supplement market imperfections
>
> > ○ Market imperfection **:** the market economy fails to allocate resources efficiently

### **4. Economic theory**

⑴ Positive economics **:** a theory that analyzes reality as it is

⑵ Normative economics **:** a theory that analyzes what ought to be done (what is desirable)
