## 1. Long-run economic growth

1) **Economic growth:** a sustained increase in **real GDP per capita**.

2) This topic studies:
- the determinants of economic growth, and  
- why growth rates differ across countries.

3) **Data 1.** A sustained rise in the income level

4) **Data 2.** An increase in the *financial interrelation ratio*

- (1) **Financial interrelation ratio = Financial assets / GDP**
- (2) **Meaning 1:** a wider range of choices in financial services
- (3) **Meaning 2 (borrowers / fund demanders):** less likely to face credit constraints
- (4) **Meaning 3 (lenders / fund suppliers):** more opportunities for asset accumulation

## 2. Short-run business cycle fluctuations

### (1) Overview
- (1) In the short run, the economy repeatedly rises and falls.
- (2) This topic studies what causes business cycles, and whether it is desirable for the government to intervene to reduce the amplitude of fluctuations.

### (2) The four phases of a business cycle
- (1) **Boom (expansion):** overall economic activity rises
- (2) **Downturn:** economic activity begins to lose momentum
- (3) **Recession (slump):** consumption and investment decline further, and employment and income fall
- (4) **Recovery:** production becomes active again and employment increases
- (5) **Upper turning point (peak):** boom → downturn
- (6) **Lower turning point (trough):** recession → recovery

### (3) Business-cycle periodicities
- (1) **Kitchin cycle:** about **40 months**; driven by inventory fluctuations
- (2) **Juglar cycle:** about **9.5 years**; driven by incremental technological innovation
- (3) **Kondratiev wave:** about **50 years**; associated with major inventions in capitalist economies (e.g., railways, electricity)

### (4) Trends in macroeconomic indicators
**Figure 1. Trends in Korea’s macroeconomic indicators** (figure referenced in the original note)

- (1) **Persistence**
  - Business-cycle movements at a given point tend to carry over from the previous state.
  - Current real GDP is influenced by past real GDP.

- (2) **Irregularity:** the amplitude and frequency of business cycles are irregular.

- (3) **Comovement:** many macro variables fluctuate with strong regularity alongside real GDP.
  - **Procyclical:** positive correlation with real GDP fluctuations
  - **Countercyclical:** negative correlation with real GDP fluctuations
  - **Acyclical:** neither procyclical nor countercyclical
  - *(Note in original: memorize three countercyclical indicators.)*

- (4) **Volatility:** the degree of deviation from the long-run trend; measured by standard deviation.
  - **Leading:** moves before real GDP
  - **Lagging:** moves after real GDP
  - **Coincident:** moves at the same time as real GDP

- (5) Cyclical behavior of major (macro/financial) indicators

  - **Consumption**
    - Among the four expenditure components of national income, consumption accounts for the largest share: **60–70% of aggregate demand**.
    - After the Asian Financial Crisis, consumption became more volatile due to “trauma-like” consumption patterns.
    - This is referred to as the **consumption volatility puzzle**.

  - **Investment**
    - Investment is the most volatile because it is influenced by psychological factors such as “animal spirits” and uncertainty.
    - Housing investment and inventory investment tend to be **leading** indicators.

  - **Government spending**
    - Government spending is planned and therefore among the least volatile indicators.
    - Because it is used to dampen fluctuations, it is described as **countercyclical**.

  - **Real interest rate**
    - A higher real interest rate restrains the economy by discouraging firms’ investment.
    - A higher real interest rate increases household debt, reducing firms’ investment.

  - **Prices (inflation rate)**
    - If booms/recessions are driven by demand-side shocks (consumption, investment, etc.): inflation is **procyclical**.
    - If booms/recessions are driven by supply-side shocks (e.g., international oil price changes): inflation is **countercyclical**.
    - **Supply-side factor 1:** stagflation due to the **1974 and 1979 oil shocks**
    - **Supply-side factor 2:** the **IMF/foreign exchange crisis**, where a sharp rise in the exchange rate greatly increased the cost of imported oil

  - **Long-term interest rate & stock index:** procyclical and leading
  - **Bank loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR):** procyclical and coincident
  - **Credit spread:** countercyclical and coincident

## 3. Unemployment
- (1) **Efficiency aspect:** loss of usable social resources (lost output)
- (2) **Equity aspect:** those with relatively fewer capabilities are more likely to become unemployed, worsening income distribution (the rich get richer, the poor get poorer)

---

## 4. Inflation
- (1) Transfers wealth and income from holders of monetary assets to holders of real assets
- (2) Ultimately transfers wealth from the private sector to the government: inflation can function like a tax on money holdings
- (3) If inflation is **anticipated**, economic agents may prepare in advance, so the harm may be smaller

---

## 5. Balance of payments and the exchange rate

- (1) **Balance of payments:** divided into the **current account** and the **capital account** (as written in the original note)
- (2) **Current account:** when net exports rise, the current account becomes a surplus; when net exports fall, it becomes a deficit
- (3) **Capital account:** when foreign exchange reserves rise, the capital account is treated as a surplus; when reserves fall, it is treated as a deficit
  - When reserves decline due to a capital-account deficit, speculative attacks may occur in anticipation of the limits.
  - Example: the IMF financial crisis
- (4) The current account and capital account generally have an inverse relationship
  - When the exchange rate rises, net exports rise, improving the current account.
  - The current-account surplus is invested abroad, implying payments to foreigners and a capital-account deficit.
