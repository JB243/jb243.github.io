⑴ **Assumption 1.** Flexible adjustment of price variables

> ① Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” **:** He believed that, due to flexibility in the labor market, a high unemployment rate could not persist.

> ② When the Great Depression in 1929 led to a high unemployment rate persisting for a period of about ten years, this assumption broke down.

⑵ **Assumption 2.** Perfect foresight

> ① Economic agents are assumed to have complete information about the market.

> ② The expected inflation rate is assumed to equal the actual inflation rate.

⑶ **Assumption 3.** Assumptions about the labor market

> ① Workers are also assumed to fully know price information, so when prices rise they immediately demand an increase in the nominal wage.

> ② Therefore, in the labor market, labor supply and labor demand become **functions of the real wage**.

> ③ The labor market is a perfectly competitive market that always achieves equilibrium, so full employment is achieved.

> ④ (Reference) Keynes assumed that, in reality, labor supply is a function of the nominal wage, while labor demand is a function of the real wage.

> ⑤ Reason **:** Because workers respond slowly to price changes.

⑷ **Assumption 4.** Money illusion does not exist

> ① Money illusion **:** Accepting that income has risen when the nominal unit increases even though the real value of income has not changed.

> ② This is an error that occurs when economic agents think in nominal variables.

⑸ **Assumption 5.** Perfectly competitive markets

**2. The Classical Approach**

⑴ **Step 1.** Labor market equilibrium **:** **Equilibrium employment** and the **equilibrium real wage** are determined simultaneously.

**Figure. 1.** Labor market equilibrium]

> ① Labor demand curve **:** A decreasing function of the quantity of labor; a function of the real wage.

> ② Labor supply curve **:** An increasing function of the quantity of labor; a function of the real wage.

> ③ Under full employment, only voluntary unemployment exists **:** In a situation of excess labor supply, involuntary unemployment exists.

> ④ **Case 1.** When the nominal wage is at a level higher than the equilibrium real wage (excess labor supply, unemployment)

>> ○ The nominal wage falls, and the real wage w/P returns to the same level.

>> ○ Ultimately, full employment is achieved.

> ⑤ **Case 2.** When the nominal wage is at a level lower than the equilibrium real wage (excess labor demand)

>> ○ The nominal wage rises, and the real wage w/P returns to the same level.

>> ○ Ultimately, full employment is achieved.

⑵ **Step 2.** Determination of equilibrium national income **:** Since we know the equilibrium employment level, we determine **equilibrium national income**.

**Figure. 2.** Determination of equilibrium national income]

> ① The economy’s aggregate production function

>> ○ Y **:** Real GDP

>> ○ z **:** Technology level

>> ○ K **:** Capital

>> ○ L **:** Labor

> ② Short-run aggregate production function

>> ○ **Feature 1.** The labor input is **always** fixed at the full-employment level (**∵** labor market equilibrium).

>> ○ **Feature 2.** A positive correlation between labor input and output.

>> ○ **Feature 3.** The law of diminishing returns **:** A concave shape when viewed from below.

>> ○ Regardless of the price level, labor input and national income are constant **:** National income at this point is called full-employment national income.

> ③ Say’s law (Say's law)

>> ○ Definition **:** The law that supply creates its own demand.

>> ○ That is, all income earned in the process of producing goods or services must be entirely spent.

>> ○ That is, the market supply curve appears as a **vertical line** with a fixed quantity supplied.

>> ○ This means the classical theory can be interpreted purely as a supply-centered convenience.

>> ○ (Reference) In reality, situations where aggregate supply ≠ aggregate demand are frequent (e.g., prolonged excess demand leading to long-term unemployment).

> ④ (Reference) Supplement to Say’s law

>> ○ Total output (Y)

>> ○ Total demand (effective demand) **:** Excluding the foreign sector,

>>> ○ IP **:** Planned investment expenditure. This excludes unintended **inventory investment** from investment.

>>> ○ (Reference) Total expenditure

>> ○ Total output = total demand

⑶ **Step 3.** Quantity theory of money (quantity theory of money) **:** Determine the **price level P**.

**Figure. 3.** Quantity theory of money]

> ① Fisher’s transactions theory

>> ○ M **:** Money supply

>> ○ V **:** Velocity of money; the average frequency with which one unit of money is used

>> ○ P **:** Price level

>> ○ Y **:** Real GDP

>> ○ Marshall’s k **:** 1 / V

> ② Assumptions of the quantity theory of money

>> ○ Velocity of money is constant.

>> ○ Real GDP is determined at the full-employment level.

>> ○ **∴** The price level does not change full-employment income YF.

>> ○ **∴** The price level is proportional to the money supply.

> ③ Conclusion

>> ○ The income elasticity of money demand is infinite **:** It says money does not have a store-of-value function and is merely a medium of exchange.

>> ○ Neutrality of money **:** Real variables that move due to real factors are distinguished from nominal variables that change due to monetary factors.

>> ○ Therefore, the cause of inflation is argued to be nothing more than a monetary phenomenon due to a rapid increase in the money supply.

>> ○ The quantity theory of money is also the core of Milton Friedman’s economics.

>> ○ Counterargument **:** Although velocity was generally stable, it has not been stable since the 1980s due to alternative means of payment.

⑷ **Step 4.** Loanable funds theory **:** Determine the **interest rate**.

**Figure. 4.** Loanable funds theory]

> ① Supply of loanable funds

>> ○ Private saving (SP, saving private) **:** An increasing function of the interest rate

>> ○ Government saving (SG, saving government) **:** Determined by the government’s fiscal policy, so it is unrelated to the interest rate

>> ○ National saving (SN, saving national) **:** An increasing function of the interest rate

> ② Demand for loanable funds (IP–r curve) **:** A decreasing function of the interest rate (**∵** borrowing costs rise)

> ③ Determination of the equilibrium interest rate **:** The intersection of the total saving supply curve and the loanable funds demand curve

> ④ Increase in government spending

>> ○ The interest rate rises as demand for loanable funds increases.

>> ○ As borrowing costs rise, investment decreases, and as saving increases, consumption decreases.

>> ○ The decrease in investment and consumption shifts the interest rate back to its original level.

>> ○ Because the interest rate is determined regardless of the money supply, it is called the **real interest rate**.

⑸ Conclusion

> ① Flexible prices and guaranteed demand **:** All markets adjust automatically. Suitable for long-run explanations.

> ② Full employment of factors of production **:** The risk of unemployment disappears.

> ③ Neutrality of money **:** Changes in the money supply cannot affect the real sector.

> ④ Saving is a virtue **:** Saving is encouraged to secure investment resources.

> ⑤ Based on unrealistic assumptions
