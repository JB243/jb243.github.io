## **1. The Harrod–Domar Model**

⑴ **Leontief production function** **:** No substitution at all between labor and capital

⑵ **Equilibrium condition**

⑶ **Problems** **:** Unstable equilibrium

> ① Because the saving rate (s), capital coefficient (v), and population growth rate (n) in the equilibrium condition are all determined exogenously, achieving equilibrium is unstable.  
> ② If the economy deviates from equilibrium, there is no automatic mechanism that brings it back.

---

## **2. The Solow Model**

⑴ **Assumption 1. Population growth**

> ① **n** **:** average annual population growth rate ＞ -1  
> ② In a long-run growth model, population represents the labor force.  
> ③ In a short-run growth model, unemployment is an important issue.

⑵ **Assumption 2. Balance between injections and leakages**

> ① **Yt** **:** total income in period t (total production income)  
> ② **s** **:** saving rate, or marginal propensity to save (MPS, marginal propensity to save)  
> ③ **1-s** **:** consumption rate, or marginal propensity to consume (MPC, marginal propensity to consume). Generally given as 0.6.  
> ④ Note: This is a closed economy and considers only the private sector, so government spending and net exports are not considered.

⑶ **Assumption 3. Cobb–Douglas production function** **:** Substitution between labor and capital is possible

> ① Total output  
> ② Output per person  
> ③ **Feature 1.** Passes through the origin  
> ④ **Feature 2.** Constant returns to scale **:** If each factor of production is doubled, output also doubles.
>
>> ○ **yt** **:** Yt / Lt, output per person  
>> ○ **kt** **:** Kt / Lt, capital per person  
>> ○ **zt** **:** total factor productivity (TFP), also called the Solow residual
>
> ⑤ **Feature 3.** Diminishing marginal product **:** If the other inputs are held fixed and one input increases, its marginal product decreases.

⑷ **Assumption 4. The process of aggregate capital accumulation**

> ① **Kt** **:** total capital stock in period t  
> ② **It** **:** total investment in period t  
> ③ **d** **:** depreciation rate per unit of capital  
> ④ **Depreciation** **:** as fixed assets such as factories or machinery are used, they wear out.

⑸ **Intertemporal accumulation process of the steady-state capital stock**

⑹ **Per-capita steady-state capital accumulation process**

**Figure 1.** Per-capita steady-state capital accumulation process]

> ① **Steady state (steady state)**

**Figure 2.** Steady state]

>> ○ Full employment of labor and capital is achieved **:** the economic growth rate = the capital growth rate = the population growth rate + the depreciation rate  
>> ○ **Right-hand side** **:** the amount of capital accumulation required to keep per-capita capital at a constant level  
>> ○ **Left-hand side** **:** equilibrium saving = the amount of capital that is actually invested

> ② When including the rate of technological progress **g**
>
>> ○ **Reason** **:** effective labor increases by the sum of the population growth rate and the rate of technological progress.

> ③ Since **zt** has continued to rise after the Industrial Revolution, the economy has not reached a converged steady state.

⑺ **Golden-rule capital stock and golden-rule saving propensity**

**Figure 3.** Golden-rule capital stock and golden-rule saving propensity]

> ① Consumption per person in the steady state  
> ② **Golden-rule capital stock** **:** the level of capital per person that maximizes steady-state consumption **c\***  
>
>> ○ (Note) Since consumers are more satisfied when consumption is maximized, the rate that maximizes it is called the “golden rule.”
>
> ③ **Golden-rule saving propensity** **:** the steady-state saving propensity at the golden-rule capital stock
>
>> ○ If the per-capita production function is **f(k) = k^α**, the golden-rule saving rate is independent of total factor productivity (**z**), the population growth rate (**n**), and the depreciation rate (**d**).  
>> ○ If the production function is Cobb–Douglas, the golden-rule saving propensity coincides with the **capital income share**.  
>> ○ The Solow model has no mechanism to adjust the discrepancy when the actual saving rate does not match the golden-rule saving rate.  
>> ○ Therefore, the **government can intervene** to adjust the actual saving rate toward the golden-rule saving level.
>
> ④ Conditions at the golden rule
>
>> ○ Capital income = investment = saving  
>> ○ Labor income = consumption  
>> ○ Saving rate = capital income share  
>> ○ Economic growth rate (**n**) = net marginal product of capital (**MPk − d**)

⑻ **Problem 1. The law of diminishing returns holds** **:** it cannot explain the driving force behind long-run economic growth

> ① Determinants of growth **:** increases in factor inputs, technological progress  
> ② **Factor 1.** Increase in factor inputs
>
>> ○ Negative correlation between per-capita income and population growth **:** reducing population growth does not generate sustained economic growth.  
>> ○ Positive correlation between per-capita income and the saving rate **:** increasing the saving rate does not generate sustained economic growth.
>>
>>> ○ Example **:** Korea’s saving rate reached 20% in the 1960s.
>>
>> ○ It raises the overall level of production, but there is a limit to increases in output per person **:** only a **level effect** exists.
>
> ③ **Factor 2.** Technological progress
>
>> ○ Although technological progress is said to be a source of sustained economic growth, the model cannot explain the determinants of technological progress within the model.
>
> ④ (Note) “Long-run growth” (for Korea) refers to growth from the 1950s to the present.

⑼ **Problem 2. The convergence hypothesis** **:** it cannot explain persistent income gaps across countries

> ① **Closed-economy assumption**
>
>> ○ With the Solow model’s diminishing marginal product of capital assumption, capital accumulation is faster in poorer countries → incomes across countries converge.
>
> ② **Open-economy assumption** **:** convergence is accelerated even further.
>
>> ○ Rich countries have a low marginal product of capital (**MPk**).  
>> ○ Poor countries have a high marginal product of capital (**MPk**).  
>> ○ **Conclusion** **:** physical capital moves from rich countries to poor countries.
>
> ③ In reality, per-capita incomes across the world do not converge, but they do converge among rich countries.

**Figure 4.** Relationship between per-capita income level and growth rate]

> ④ **Cause 1.** In endogenous growth models such as the AK model, the marginal product of capital does not diminish.  
> ⑤ **Cause 2.** If countries differ in the economy’s technology level (total factor productivity), production function, saving rate, population growth rate, depreciation rate, etc.
>
>> ○ (Note) **Absolute convergence** **:** if only initial capital differs, two countries converge to the same income level.  
>> ○ (Note) **Conditional convergence** **:** two countries converge only if other conditions are the same.  
>> ○ Empirical analyses find that cross-country differences in technology levels are the most important factor behind conditional convergence.

⑽ **Balanced growth path**

> ① Long-run growth equilibrium (or steady state) is a situation in which output per person, capital per person, consumption per person, etc. grow at a constant rate.  
> ② Long-run growth equilibrium (or steady state) is a special case of a balanced growth path where the constant growth rate equals 0.
