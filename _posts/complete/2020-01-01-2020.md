**2\. R & D Model**

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition **:** A model in which the rate of technological progress is determined endogenously by the research and development sector  
> ② Proposed by Paul Romer in the mid-1980s

⑵ Basic assumptions

> ① At **:** the existing stock of knowledge in period t  
> ② LA,t **:** research personnel working in the R&D sector in period t. In an aging society  
> ③ kt **:** per-capita capital in period t  
> ④ yt **:** per-capita production function in period t. Marginal product diminishes, but long-run growth is possible through At  
> ⑤ nA **:** growth rate of research personnel  
> ⑥ λ **:** productivity of research personnel  
> ⑦ φ **:** spillover effect of existing knowledge

⑶ Deriving the steady state

⑷ Conclusion

> ① Knowledge accumulation by the R&D sector → higher rate of technological progress → higher long-run economic growth rate  
> ② An aging society  
>> ○ The scale of labor allocated to R&D shrinks  
>> ○ λ, i.e., the productivity of research personnel, declines  
> ③ **Policy implications**  
>> ○ Protect R&D outcomes through institutional arrangements such as property rights and patent law  
>> ○ Provide tax incentives for R&D investment  
>> ○ Concentrate R&D investment in the research sector  
>>> ○ If R&D investment is concentrated in the development sector, the contribution of R&D investment to growth is not high  
>>> ○ **Reason 1.** If you simply adopt what others have researched, the positive spillover effects of existing knowledge are not large  
>>> ○ **Reason 2.** Investment using technology is not activated, so the growth effect of R&D spending is not large

**3. Human Capital Model**

⑴ Overview

> ① Since the per-capita production function is expressed in the form of AK, it is also called the AK model  
> ② **Constant marginal product** **:** Because labor is not effectively a fixed input factor, increases in human capital make long-run economic growth possible  
>> ○ **Diminishing marginal product** **:** As additional labor is投入ed, inefficiency is maximized, because each factor interferes with one another  
>> ○ Diminishing marginal product is fundamentally a phenomenon that arises because there exists a fixed input factor  
>> ○ The human-capital model brings about an unlimited increase in effective labor, so diminishing marginal product does not appear

⑵ Lucas model **:** Proposed by Robert Lucas

> ① Assumptions  
>> ○ Assume consumers do not save or borrow  
>> ○ For simplicity, assume the population growth rate is 0  
> ② **Step 1.** The consumer’s human capital accumulation process  
>> ○ hts **:** amount of human capital held in period t  
>> ○ u **:** the share of available time (normalized to 1 each period) invested in labor  
>> ○ 1-u **:** the share of available time (normalized to 1 each period) invested in acquiring knowledge and skills  
>> ○ b **:** efficiency of the education sector (education system, policy, etc.)  
>> ○ (Note) In Korea, a lot of repetitive instruction occurs in the private education market, so b is not high  
> ③ **Step 2.** Labor market equilibrium  
> **Figure. 1.** Determination of the equilibrium real wage  
>> ○ **Labor supply curve** **:** As effective labor supply uhts increases, the real wage rises (i.e., workers “ask for” a higher wage)  
>> ○ **Labor demand curve** **:** Since firms’ profit is always 0 regardless of the real wage, firms’ labor demand is invariant to the real wage  
>> ○ Equilibrium between the labor supply curve and the labor demand curve  
>> ○ (＃) Through equilibrium in the goods market, one can prove the equality between marginal productivity z and the real wage w  
>> ○ (※) In this case, firms’ profit becomes 0  
>> ○ (Note) Walras’ Law **:** If there is equilibrium in n-1 markets out of n, the remaining market is also in equilibrium (the reason (＃) and (※) hold simultaneously)  
> ④ Deriving the steady state or balanced growth path  
> **Figure. 2.** Lucas model  
> ⑤ **Policy implications**  
>> ○ **Decrease u** **:** Establish incentives for economic agents to invest more in human capital through measures such as lifelong education systems  
>> ○ **Increase b** **:** Improve the efficiency of education through reforms such as greater autonomy and substantive improvement in university education

⑶ Learning-by-doing model

> ① Learning-by-doing **:** Workers acquire human capital such as knowledge and skills directly through production activities  
> ② Basic assumption **:** The quantity of goods produced by workers and the physical capital used by workers have a **positive effect** on human capital  
> ③ Deriving the steady state or balanced growth path  
> **Figure. 3.** Learning-by-doing model

⑷ Model of simultaneous accumulation of physical capital and human capital

> ① Definition **:** Even if the marginal product of each diminishes, long-run economic growth is possible when physical capital and human capital are accumulated simultaneously  
> ② Basic assumptions  
>> ○ kt **:** physical capital  
>> ○ ht **:** human capital  
>> ○ s **:** investment share in physical capital relative to per-capita income  
>> ○ q **:** investment share in human capital relative to per-capita income  
>> ○ Assume the population growth rate is 0  
> ③ Deriving the steady state or balanced growth path  
> **Figure. 4.** Simultaneous accumulation model of physical and human capital  
> ④ **Policy implications**  
>> ○ To sustain growth, institutions and policies are needed to support the simultaneous accumulation of physical capital and human capital
