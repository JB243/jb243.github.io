 ⑴ Keynes’s view

> ① Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” **:** because of flexibility in the labor market, high unemployment could not persist.

> ② The Great Depression of 1929 led to high unemployment persisting for more than ten years, and this assumption broke down.

...

> ③ Keynes pointed out that a decline in aggregate demand is important for high unemployment.

> ④ In particular, among consumption (C), investment (I), and government spending (G), he emphasized the role of government spending.

> ⑤ Keynes favored a big government.

 ⑵ **Assumption 1.** Rigidity of price variables

> ① Keynes basically thought that price variables are rigid.

> ② In particular, he assumed that wages have **downward rigidity** due to factors such as the **period of employment contracts** and the influence of **labor unions**.

>> ○ When there is excess demand for labor, nominal wages can rise easily.

>> ○ When there is excess supply of labor, nominal wages cannot fall easily.

 ⑶ **Assumption 2.** Imperfect information

> ① Labor demand **:** a function of the real wage

> ② Labor supply **:** a function of the nominal wage

> ③ (Reference) In other words, he viewed workers as thinking mainly in terms of nominal wages, and thus falling into money illusion.

 ⑷ **Assumption 3.** Existence of idle capacity

> ① He viewed the **economy as being in a recession**, so even if output is increased up to the full-employment level, production costs do not rise.

> ② Even if aggregate demand increases and aggregate supply increases accordingly, the assumption that **prices are fixed** may still be valid.

> ③ If this is assumed in the extreme, a **horizontal AS curve** is derived.

 ⑸ **Assumption 4.** Principle of effective demand

> ① Basically, Keynes’s General Theory assumes an economic recession.

> ② Under a recession, sufficient production is not achieved due to a lack of aggregate demand.

> ③ He argued that if aggregate demand increases, idle capacity declines and national income (total output) increases **without a rise in prices**.

> ④ (Reference) In a boom, the level of national income can be determined by aggregate supply.

 ⑹ Keynes is suitable for recessions and the short run, while classical theory is suitable for booms and the long run.

**2\. Keynes’s General Theory**

 ⑴ **Step 1.** Equilibrium in the goods market

> ① Consumption demand (C)

>> ○ Disposable income **:** (Note) This means that it is possible to dispose of (use), not that it literally means “dispose.”

>> ○ Absolute income hypothesis **:** In the simplified Keynesian model, autonomous consumption (C0) is set to 0.

>> ○ Marginal propensity to consume (MPC, marginal propensity to consume) **:** the proportion by which consumption increases when disposable income increases by 1 unit.

> ② Investment demand (I)

>> ○ Investment is broadly classified into equipment investment, construction investment, and inventory investment.

>> ○ The classical school emphasized the interest rate, but Keynes emphasized entrepreneurs’ animal spirits and national income more.

>> ○ Investment function

>>> ○ I0 **:** autonomous investment demand. Investment demand that occurs regardless of the interest rate or national income.

>>> ○ iY **:** induced investment demand. In the simplified Keynesian model, **this is not included**.

> ③ Government demand (G) and net exports (X-Q)

>> ○ Government spending is determined by policy; it is constant regardless of national income, and its magnitude is given.

>> ○ In the simplified Keynesian model, government demand and net exports are set to 0.

> ④ **Aggregate demand curve** (AD curve) **:** for the aggregate demand level E,

>> ○ The aggregate demand curve is drawn as relatively flat **:** because the marginal propensity to consume is less than 1.

 ⑵ **Step 2.** Equilibrium in the money market

> ① Overview

>> ○ (Reference) In the IS–LM model, the aggregate demand curve is derived by analyzing the goods market and the money market.

>> ○ In Keynes’s General Theory, the aggregate demand curve can be derived from the goods market alone.

> ② Determination of the interest rate

>> ○ (Reference) Interest rate determination in the classical school

>>> ○ **Loanable funds theory** **:** the interest rate is determined by the supply and demand for funds in the real sector (i.e., saving and investment are determined).

>>> ○ The IS curve is relatively flat; the LM curve is relatively steep.

>> ○ Interest rate determination in the Keynesian school

>>> ○ [Liquidity preference theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2026) **:** Keynes viewed the interest rate as being determined by the demand and supply of money.

>>> ○ Keynes assumed a [liquidity trap](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2026).

>>> ○ The IS curve is relatively steep; **the LM curve is relatively flat.**

 ⑶ **Step 3.** Aggregate supply curve **:** it is sufficient to satisfy **either** **Assumption 1** or **Assumption 2**

> ① **Assumption 1.** **Money illusion** **:** When expected prices (Pe) and actual prices (P) differ, workers mistake a change in the nominal wage W = P·w for a change in the real wage (i.e., static expectations about the price level).

>> ○ Labor supply **:** even if the price level rises, the labor supply curve does not change as long as workers do not revise their expectations.

>> ○ Labor demand **:** firms, as labor demanders, face the real wage, so if prices fall, the labor demand curve shifts left.

>> ○ **Conclusion 1.** Labor supply is a function of the nominal wage; labor demand is a function of the real wage.

>> ○ **Conclusion 2.** Equilibrium employment is determined entirely by labor demand.

> ③ **Assumption 2.** **Downward rigidity of nominal wages**

**Figure. 1.** Downward rigidity of nominal wages

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Labor contracts are not made continuously, but are concluded for fixed time periods.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** In the labor market, workers do not accept reductions in nominal wages (downward rigidity in the labor market).

>> ○ **Reason 3.** When quantities are small, there is idle capacity, so even if quantity increases, nominal wages do not increase (to be revised later).

>> ○ Labor supply **:** because of downward rigidity in nominal wages, labor supply does not change even if prices fall.

>> ○ Labor demand **:** firms, as labor demanders, face the real wage, so if prices fall, the labor demand curve shifts left.

>> ○ **Conclusion 1.** Labor supply is a function of the nominal wage; labor demand is a function of the real wage.

>> ○ **Conclusion 2.** Equilibrium employment is determined entirely by labor demand.

> ④ **Aggregate supply curve** (AS curve) **:** for the aggregate demand level E,

>> ○ The aggregate supply curve is represented by a 45° line.

>>> ○ Reason **:** if there is demand for goods or services, supply is automatically met.

>> ○ Once the potential national income level (Y*) is reached, the supply curve becomes vertical.

>>> ○ Potential national income level **:** the level of national income at full employment.

>>> ○ Reason **:** since the economy is already at full employment, even if aggregate demand increases, output cannot increase because **there are no available resources**.

 ⑷ **Step 4.** Determination of equilibrium national income

**Figure. 2.** Determination of equilibrium national income under Keynesian theory]

> ① In the simplified Keynesian model, government spending G and net exports X-Q are set to 0.

> ② Saving ＞ investment **:** investment decreases in the next period.

> ③ Saving ＜ investment **:** investment increases in the next period.

> ④ Saving = investment **:** production is unchanged; i.e., equilibrium is achieved.

> ⑤ Output gap **:** shown in orange. Equilibrium national income − potential national income.

 ⑸ Conclusion

> ① **Interpretation 1.** Boom and recession

>> ○ Boom **:** prices increase. The excess effective demand is called the inflationary gap.

>> ○ Why prices rise **:** as new capacity is expanded, unit supply costs increase.

>> ○ Recession **:** the shortfall of effective demand is called the deflationary gap.

>> ○ Keynes basically assumed an economic recession and diagnosed the cause as insufficient demand.

>> ○ If government spending is increased, effective demand rises; thus, he thought that increasing it by the size of the deflationary gap would return the economy to a normal state.

>> ○ (Reference) Keynes considered government spending to be the only solution in a recession.

> ② **Interpretation 2.** Multiplier theory

>> ○ Multiplier **:** (increase in equilibrium national income) ÷ (increase in autonomous expenditure)

>> ○ The multiplier equals the inverse of the slope of the Y vs. AD curve.

>> ○ Algebraic interpretation **:** G increases → Y increases → Yd increases → Y increases → Yd increases → ···

> ③ **Interpretation 3.** Effect of government spending **:** for proportional tax T = tY and an exogenous variable G,

> ④ **Interpretation 4.** Paradox of thrift

>> ○ When the economy is bad, each individual increases saving → this promotes (deepens) the recession.

>> ○ An error where individual rationality does not coincide with rationality for society as a whole.

>> ○ With similar logic to multiplier theory, if induced investment exists, national income decreases more quickly.

>> ○ **Case 1.** Developing countries **:** because funds are scarce, saving is sufficiently transformed into investment, so saving is socially a virtue.

>> ○ **Case 2.** Advanced economies / during a recession **:** due to a lack of investment opportunities, an increase in saving does not lead to an increase in investment. The paradox of thrift.
