## **1. Limitations of earlier models**

⑴ **Limitation 1.** Even when analyzing demand-side factors, earlier frameworks did not consider the role of the interest rate determined in the money market.

> ① In the Keynesian model, when analyzing the goods market, the interest rate was treated as given.  
> ② In the Keynesian model, when analyzing the money market, total output (income) was treated as given.  
> ③ In reality, the goods market and the money market affect each other through the interest rate as an intermediary variable.  
> ④ The IS–LM model achieves simultaneous equilibrium in the goods market and the money market.

⑵ **Limitation 2.** They emphasized demand-side factors only and did not analyze supply-side factors.

> ① The IS–LM model also does not analyze supply-side factors.  
> ② Later, the AD–AS model considers supply-side factors as well.

---

## **2. The IS–LM model**

⑴ Overview

> ① **Aggregate demand side of GDP:** goods market, money market, foreign exchange market  
> ② **Aggregate supply side of GDP:** labor market  
> ③ **Assumption 1.** Assume a small open economy.
>
>> ○ Most countries participate as price-takers.  
>> ○ Under this assumption, the foreign exchange market can be ignored.
>
> ④ **Assumption 2.** In the IS–LM model, **price changes are not considered.**
>
>> ○ A constant price level means the market has a horizontal demand curve.  
>> ○ Since the price level does not change, there is no need to distinguish between the real interest rate and the nominal interest rate.
>
> ⑤ Since there are two endogenous variables (unknowns), **Y** and **r**, we use two equations: goods-market equilibrium and money-market equilibrium.

⑵ **Step 1. Goods-market equilibrium:** derive the **IS curve** (via the **loanable-funds market** perspective)

> ① Basic assumption: the supply of consumption/investment, etc., is automatically met.
>
>> ○ In equation (1), the left-hand side is total supply, and the right-hand side is total demand.  
>>> ○ **Total supply:** for aggregate demand level E, E = Y  
>>> ○ **Total demand:** for aggregate demand level E, E = C + I + G + (X - Q)  
>>> ○ In the IS–LM model, equilibrium national income is effectively aggregate demand.  
>>> ○ In the AD–AS model, we begin to consider aggregate supply explicitly.
>
>> ○ Another interpretation: goods-market equilibrium is achieved as the equality of investment (injection) and saving (leakage).  
>> ○ **b:** interest-rate elasticity of investment  
>>> ○ Classical view: b ≫ 1  
>>> ○ Keynesian view: b = 0  
>> ○ (Reference) **Accelerator principle:** investment and income are positively correlated.

> ② Goods-market equilibrium

**Figure 1.** Goods-market equilibrium and derivation of the IS curve

>> ○ **IS curve:** the set of (Y, r) combinations that bring equilibrium in the goods market, plotted in the (Y, r) plane.

> ③ Interpretation: when government spending increases/decreases, the IS curve shifts right/left.

⑶ **Step 2. Asset-market equilibrium: derive the LM curve (money market)**

> ① Asset-market equilibrium
>
>> ○ Asset choice between two perfectly substitutable financial assets: money and bonds  
>> ○ Asset-market equilibrium conditions  
>>> ○ **Md:** demand for money  
>>> ○ **Bd:** demand for bonds  
>>> ○ **Ms:** supply of money  
>>> ○ **Bs:** supply of bonds  
>>
>> ○ If the money market is in equilibrium, the bond market is also in equilibrium.  
>>> ○ Money-market equilibrium interest rate = bond-market equilibrium interest rate  
>>> ○ Therefore, the LM curve introduced below focuses **only on the money market**.

> ② **Real money demand (L, liquidity):** based on liquidity preference theory
>
>> ○ Transaction (precautionary) money demand: an increasing function of income. Dividing by P converts to real terms.  
>> ○ Speculative money demand: a decreasing function of the interest rate. Dividing by P converts to real terms.  
>> ○ (Reference) Why speculative demand exists: agents temporarily hold money while waiting for profitable investment opportunities in interest-bearing assets.  
>> ○ **Supplement 1.** Why bond prices rise when interest rates fall: by present-value logic, r appears in the denominator.  
>> ○ (Note) If interest rates rise, bond profitability rises (bond prices fall).  
>> ○ **Supplement 2.** Agents believe there is a “normal” interest rate and that the actual rate will revert to it (assumption).  
>> ○ **Supplement 3.** Classical economists do not recognize speculative money demand.  
>> ○ (Note) Money is a liquid asset, whereas bonds are not—hence “liquidity preference.”  
>>
>> ○ Real money demand = transaction money demand + speculative money demand  
>> ○ **k:** income elasticity of money demand (classical: large; Keynesian: small)  
>> ○ **h:** interest-rate elasticity of money demand (classical: small; Keynesian: large)  
>> ○ Remaining term: autonomous money demand  
>> ○ (Note) Unlike classical economists, Keynes emphasized the interest-rate elasticity **h**.

> ③ Money supply (M, money)
>
>> ○ If the monetary base is exogenously determined: **independent of the interest rate**.  
>>> ○ When the currency-deposit ratio and required reserve ratio are stable, the monetary base set by the central bank determines money supply.
>>
>> ○ The money stock is determined as a money-multiplier multiple of the monetary base: it is also **independent of the interest rate**.  
>>> ○ **H:** monetary base (high-powered money) supplied by the central bank  
>>> ○ **C:** currency created through deposit creation  
>>> ○ **D:** deposit money supplied by commercial banks (also called demand deposits)  
>>> ○ **E:** loans provided by banks to the private sector  
>>> ○ **η:** fraction of currency held by the public out of the money stock (C + D), 0 < η < 1  
>>> ○ **θ:** fraction of deposits (D) held as required reserves, 0 < θ < 1  
>>> ○ **1 / (η + θ(1 - η)) :** money multiplier (or credit multiplier)  
>>> ○ Deposit money creation process: **loans flow back** into currency and deposits.

**Table 1.** Deposit money creation process

>> ○ The following expression is also useful:  
>>> ○ **k:** currency-deposit ratio (C / D)  
>>> ○ **z:** required reserve ratio (R / D)

> ④ Money-market equilibrium

**Figure 2.** Money-market equilibrium and derivation of the LM curve

>> ○ **LM curve:** the set of (Y, r) combinations that bring equilibrium in the money market, plotted in the (Y, r) plane.  
>>> ○ L stands for money demand or liquidity preference.  
>>> ○ M stands for money supply.  
>>
>> ○ Formulation: the IS–LM model does not consider price changes. Dividing by P converts to real terms.

> ⑤ Interpretation
>
>> ○ If real money supply increases/decreases, the LM curve shifts right/left.  
>> ○ If real money demand decreases/increases, the LM curve shifts right/left.

⑷ **Step 3. The intersection of IS and LM:** simultaneous equilibrium in the goods market and money market

> ① Equilibrium national income  
> ② Government spending multiplier  
> ③ For the IS curve: left of the curve (excess demand → pressure to move right). On the curve (no left-right movement). Right of the curve (excess supply → pressure to move left).  
> ④ For the LM curve: above the curve (downward movement pressure). On the curve (no up-down movement). Below the curve (upward movement pressure).  
> ⑤ In disequilibrium: the sum of the movement components in (③) and (④) appears. (Note) It can feel like rotating **counterclockwise**.

⑸ Applications

> ① Multiplier effects  
>> ○ The larger the injections (c, i), the larger the multiplier.  
>> ○ The smaller the leakages (s, t, m), the larger the multiplier.
>
> ② Crowding-out  
>> ○ Definition: when government spending increases, output Y does not rise by the full multiplier amount.  
>> ○ Mechanism: G ↑ → Y ↑ (by ΔG × multiplier) → Ld ↑ → r ↑ → I ↓ → Y ↓  
>> ○ Classical and monetarist views: crowding-out is large.  
>> ○ Keynesian view: crowding-out is small.
>
> ③ Fiscal policy and monetary (financial) policy  
>> ○ Fiscal policy: government policy through shifts in the IS curve  
>> ○ Monetary policy: government policy through shifts in the LM curve  
>> ○ **Tip 1.** The flatter the IS curve: fiscal policy becomes less effective; monetary policy becomes more effective.  
>> ○ **Tip 2.** The flatter the LM curve: fiscal policy becomes more effective; monetary policy becomes less effective.  
>> ○ (Note) To understand these tips, consider multiplier effects and crowding-out.
>
> ④ Liquidity trap  
>> ○ Definition: when the **nominal interest rate** is extremely low, everyone expects interest rates to rise soon.  
>>> ○ (Reference) People hold cash now and plan to buy bonds later, expecting rates to rise.  
>>> ○ Speculative money demand rises without bound (h → ∞) → liquidity becomes “trapped.”  
>>> ○ Money demand is absorbed into speculative demand; transaction demand does not rise, so income does not change.  
>>> ○ A horizontal LM curve: even if monetary policy shifts LM rightward, the curve does not effectively change.  
>>> ○ Assumption used in the Keynesian model.
>>
>> ○ Pigou effect  
>>> ○ Even in a liquidity trap, monetary policy may be effective.  
>>> ○ Consumption function includes the real value of wealth.  
>>> ○ Goods-market equilibrium includes the real value of wealth.  
>>> ○ **Case 1.** Money supply increases or P falls → real wealth (A/P) rises → consumption rises → aggregate demand rises (IS shifts right).  
>>> ○ **Case 2.** Quantitative easing → direct injection of liquidity → real wealth (A/P) rises.  
>>>> ○ Ultimately, the IS–LM intersection shifts right: the liquidity-trap problem is alleviated.  
>>> ○ **Case 3.** Domestic stock prices rise → real wealth (A/P) rises.  
>>>> ○ (Reference) Higher stock prices can raise investment via Tobin’s q theory.
>>> ○ Effects  
>>>> ○ Money supply increases or P falls → aggregate demand rises → the AD curve becomes flatter.  
>>>> ○ Consumption may increase more than income.
>>
>> ○ Quantitative easing (QE)  
>>> ○ The central bank purchases government bonds and certain private assets to directly inject liquidity (money) into the market.  
>>> ○ In other words, it supplies short-term liquidity directly where funding is needed, not only through government bonds.  
>>> ○ **Effect 1.** Credit creation via an increased monetary base: stimulates consumption and investment.  
>>> ○ **Effect 2.** Increases real wealth by injecting abundant liquidity.  
>>> ○ **Effect 3.** Depreciates the domestic currency, increasing net exports.  
>>> ○ **Effect 4.** Raises expected inflation, encouraging current consumption and increasing overall consumption.  
>>> ○ Shifts the IS curve.  
>>> ○ Japan has pursued QE under the name “Abenomics” to escape a liquidity trap.

## **3. The IS–LM–BP model**  
**BP** comes from the first letters of *balance of payments*.

⑴ Exchange rate (exchange rate)

> ① Overview  
>> ○ Definition: the exchange ratio between two countries’ currencies (e.g., how many won per 1 dollar).  
>> ○ An increase/decrease in the exchange rate means the domestic currency value falls/rises.
>
> ② **Exchange rate determination theory 1: Purchasing power parity (PPP)**  
>> ○ Definition: exchange rates are determined by the ratio of purchasing power (i.e., the ratio of price levels) across countries.  
>> ○ Equilibrium exchange rate: prevents arbitrage between foreign and domestic goods.  
>>> ○ **e:** equilibrium exchange rate  
>>> ○ **P, Pf:** domestic and foreign price levels (not the price of an individual good)  
>>> ○ If ePf > P: imports fall, exports rise → FX supply increases → exchange rate falls.  
>>> ○ If ePf < P: imports rise, exports fall → FX demand increases → exchange rate rises.  
>> ○ Premise: the law of one price holds and trade is active.  
>> ○ Limits: trade barriers (tariffs), transaction costs, heterogeneous goods, existence of non-tradables.  
>> ○ Evidence: among advanced economies with low trade barriers and low transaction costs, PPP tends to hold **in the long run**.
>
> ③ **Exchange rate determination theory 2: Interest rate parity (IRP)** (proposed by Dornbusch)  
>> ○ Definition: focusing on the capital account, the exchange rate is determined at the level that equalizes investment returns across countries.  
>> ○ **IRP curve:** when the interest rate or exchange rate changes, the point moves; when the expected future exchange rate changes, the curve shifts.

**Figure 3.** IRP curve

>>> ○ **r:** domestic real interest rate  
>>> ○ **rf:** foreign real interest rate  
>>> ○ **et:** current exchange rate  
>>> ○ **eᵉ_{t+1}:** expected exchange rate one year ahead  
>>> ○ **1 + r:** future value of 1 unit of domestic currency  
>>> ○ **(eᵉ_{t+1} / et) × (1 + rf):** future value if 1 unit is converted into dollars now  
>>> ○ **Δeᵉ / e:** expected rate of exchange-rate change; equals the nominal interest-rate differential
>>
>> ○ Taking logs yields the following approximation.  
>> ○ Capital movement: since asset prices and interest rates are generally inversely related, capital tends to move toward higher interest rates.  
>>> ○ If (LHS) > (RHS): demand and price of domestic financial assets rise → domestic interest rate falls; domestic money demand rises → exchange rate falls.  
>>> ○ If (LHS) < (RHS): demand and price of foreign financial assets rise → foreign interest rate falls; foreign money demand rises → exchange rate rises.
>>
>> ○ (Reference) Covered interest parity  
>>> ○ Definition: the expected exchange rate is a contracted forward exchange rate.  
>>> ○ No exposure to investment-loss risk.
>>
>> ○ Evidence: works well among countries with free capital mobility and financial products of similar risk.  
>>> ○ 1960s–1970s: international capital mobility was directly controlled; exchange-rate changes were mainly driven by current-account changes.  
>>> ○ Since the 1980s: cross-border capital flows expanded → the capital account plays a larger role in exchange-rate movements.
>
> ④ (Reference) **Exchange rate determination theory 3: Current-account theory**  
>> ○ The exchange rate is determined where FX demand and supply intersect.  
>> ○ If the current account improves, FX supply increases (supply curve shifts right).  
>> ○ The equilibrium exchange rate falls, i.e., the domestic currency appreciates.  
>> ○ (Note) This does not seem to be a major concept here.

⑵ When interest rate parity holds

> ① (Reference) Goods-market equilibrium  
> ② (Reference) Money-market equilibrium  
> ③ Foreign exchange market equilibrium (**IRP curve**)

**Figure 4.** IRP curve

> ④ IS–LM–IRP system  
>> ○ (Note) This is much simpler than the IS–LM–BP system below.  
>> ○ If the expected exchange rate is constant: not very different from standard IS–LM; the nominal exchange rate is determined afterward.  
>> ○ If the expected exchange rate changes: the IRP curve shifts and first affects investment, net exports, etc.
>
> ⑤ Floating exchange rate regime  
>> ○ Floating exchange rate regime (see below)  
>> ○ Expansionary monetary policy  
>>> ○ 1st. LM shifts right due to higher real money supply.  
>>> ○ 2nd. Real income rises; the interest rate falls.  
>>> ○ 3rd. As the interest rate falls, the point moves along IRP → the nominal exchange rate rises.  
>>> ○ 4th. As the nominal exchange rate rises, exports increase and imports decrease: movement along the IS curve.
>>
>> ○ Expansionary fiscal policy  
>>> ○ 1st. IS shifts right.  
>>> ○ 2nd. Real income rises; the interest rate rises.  
>>> ○ 3rd. As the interest rate rises, the point moves along IRP → the nominal exchange rate falls.  
>>> ○ 4th. As the nominal exchange rate falls, exports decrease and imports increase: movement along the LM curve.
>
> ⑤ Fixed exchange rate regime  
>> ○ Fixed exchange rate regime (see below)  
>> ○ Expansionary monetary policy  
>> ○ Expansionary fiscal policy

⑶ When interest rate parity does not hold

> ① **Factor 1: PPP**  
>> ○ An increasing function of the real exchange rate: a lower domestic currency value boosts exports and suppresses imports.  
>> ○ An increasing function of foreign income (Yf): exports rise with foreign income.  
>> ○ A decreasing function of domestic income (Y): imports rise with domestic income.
>
> ② **Factor 2: IRP**  
>> ○ Under IRP, net capital inflows are determined by the domestic–foreign interest-rate differential and expected exchange-rate changes.  
>> ○ For simplicity, the expected rate of exchange-rate change is often set to 0. (Note) That is, IRP is not explicitly considered.  
>> ○ In other words, next period’s exchange rate is expected to equal the current period’s actual exchange rate.
>
> ③ (Reference) Goods-market equilibrium  
> ④ (Reference) Money-market equilibrium  
> ⑤ Foreign exchange market equilibrium (**BP curve**): combinations of national income (Y) and interest rate (r) that yield balance-of-payments equilibrium

>> ○ Formulation  
>>> ○ **NX:** the part of net exports determined as an increasing function of the real exchange rate (ePf / P) and foreign income  
>>> ○ **NX - qY:** net exports  
>>> ○ **rp:** risk premium  
>>> ○ **F(r - rf - rp):** net capital inflow  
>>> ○ **BP > 0:** balance-of-payments surplus  
>>> ○ **BP < 0:** balance-of-payments deficit

**Figure 5.** BP curve with imperfect vs. perfect capital mobility

>> ○ **Case 1. BP curve under perfect capital mobility**  
>>> ○ Capital inflows and outflows are completely free.  
>>> ○ A **horizontal BP curve:** capital moves so sensitively to the interest-rate differential that a sustained differential cannot exist.  
>>> ○ Since (r - rf) is approximately the expected rate of exchange-rate change, expected exchange-rate change is near 0.
>>
>> ○ **Case 2. BP curve under imperfect capital mobility**  
>>> ○ Capital flows occur at a limited level (transaction costs, etc.).  
>>> ○ An **upward-sloping BP curve:** higher income worsens the current account → to keep BP = 0, the interest rate must rise.  
>>> ○ If the exchange rate rises, the BP curve shifts **right**.  
>>> ○ (Reference) In the 1980s, global capital mobility was not fully free.
>>
>> ○ **Case 3. BP curve under extreme capital controls**  
>>> ○ Since total output is fixed, it appears as a vertical line.  
>>> ○ If the exchange rate rises, the BP curve shifts **right**.

> ⑥ IS–LM–BP system (also called the Mundell–Fleming model)
>
>> ○ Domestic interest rate: at the intersection of the IS and LM curves  
>> ○ International interest rate: on the BP curve  
>>
>> ○ _Rightward shift of IS:_ increase in autonomous investment, fiscal deficits and overconsumption, yuan appreciation, tax cuts, higher unemployment benefits  
>> ○ _Leftward shift of IS:_ decline in corporate equipment investment, recession, downturn in advanced economies, excessive household debt, North Korea nuclear crisis, deteriorating investor sentiment  
>> ○ _Rightward shift of LM:_ central bank open-market purchases of government bonds, lower required reserve ratio, development of money substitutes  
>> ○ _Leftward shift of LM:_ central bank open-market sales of government bonds, higher required reserve ratio, interest-rate hikes  
>> ○ _Upward shift of BP:_ higher world interest rates, higher risk premium due to sovereign credit downgrade  
>> ○ _Downward shift of BP:_ lower world interest rates, lower risk premium due to sovereign credit upgrade  
>> ○ _Rightward shift of BP:_ higher exchange rate, higher foreign income  
>> ○ _Leftward shift of BP:_ (not specified)

> ⑦ Floating exchange rate regime and the BP curve (PPP)
>
>> ○ **Floating exchange rate regime**  
>>> ○ A regime in which the exchange rate is freely determined at the level that equalizes FX demand and supply, without central bank intervention.  
>>> ○ If there is no government intervention at all, it is a free float; otherwise it is a managed float.  
>>> ○ Under a floating regime, FX-market equilibrium is a necessary and sufficient condition for balance-of-payments equilibrium, because the exchange rate adjusts flexibly.
>>
>> ○ **Case 1. Domestic interest rate > world interest rate**  
>>> ○ 1st. Net capital inflow, BOP surplus  
>>> ○ 2nd. Exchange rate falls  
>>> ○ 3rd. Current account worsens: exports fall  
>>> ○ 4th. IS shifts left
>>
>> ○ **Case 2. Domestic interest rate < world interest rate**  
>>> ○ 1st. Net capital outflow, BOP deficit  
>>> ○ 2nd. Exchange rate rises  
>>> ○ 3rd. Current account improves: exports rise  
>>> ○ 4th. IS shifts right
>>
>> ○ Higher government spending or tax cuts  
>>> ○ Shifts IS right, but capital inflow → exchange rate fall → net exports fall → IS returns toward its original position.  
>>> ○ As a result, a fiscal deficit (lower tax revenue) and a current-account deficit occur; this is called the **twin deficits**.
>>
>> ○ Monetary policy  
>>> ○ Under a floating regime, the freer capital mobility is, the larger the income-expansion effect.  
>>> ○ It frees the economy from the burden of maintaining a fixed exchange rate and blocks the leakage of monetary-policy effects abroad.
>>
>> ○ Fiscal policy  
>>> ○ Under a floating regime, the freer capital mobility is, the smaller the income-expansion effect.

> ⑧ Fixed exchange rate regime and the BP curve (PPP)
>
>> ○ Fixed exchange rate regime  
>>> ○ Raising (lowering) the fixed exchange rate level implies a depreciation (appreciation) of the domestic currency.  
>>> ○ Examples: Argentina; the Eurozone (giving up the national currency)
>>
>> ○ **Case 1. Domestic interest rate > world interest rate**  
>>> ○ 1st. Net capital inflow, BOP surplus  
>>> ○ 2nd. Pressure for the exchange rate to fall (domestic currency appreciates)  
>>> ○ 3rd. The **central bank** intervenes: sells domestic currency and buys foreign currency  
>>> ○ 4th. Domestic money supply increases  
>>> ○ 5th. LM shifts right
>>
>> ○ **Case 2. Domestic interest rate < world interest rate**  
>>> ○ 1st. Net capital outflow, BOP deficit  
>>> ○ 2nd. Pressure for the exchange rate to rise (domestic currency depreciates)  
>>> ○ 3rd. The **central bank** intervenes: buys domestic currency and sells foreign currency  
>>> ○ 4th. Domestic money supply decreases  
>>> ○ 5th. LM shifts left
>>
>> ○ Devaluation and revaluation  
>>> ○ Devaluation: lower the domestic currency value by raising the fixed exchange rate level, increasing net exports  
>>> ○ Upvaluation (revaluation)
>>
>> ○ Sterilization policy  
>>> ○ Definition: to offset money-supply changes caused as a byproduct of a fixed exchange rate regime, the central bank conducts open-market operations in the opposite direction of FX intervention.  
>>> ○ If the central bank sells domestic currency and buys FX (**Case 1**), it sells competing domestic bonds in the open market.  
>>> ○ This can create the illusion of no change in money supply, temporarily generating IS–LM–BP imbalance.  
>>> ○ In general, sterilization cannot last long.  
>>> ○ In particular, if FX is sold, reserves fall and speculation may occur in anticipation of that limit.

⑷ Applications

> ① J-curve effect  
>> ○ Definition: after raising the exchange rate, the current account may worsen in the short run even though it improves in the long run.  
>> ○ Reason: prices change immediately, but export and import quantities adjust only with a lag.
>
> ② Overshooting theory  
>> ○ Definition: because the price level is sticky in the short run, the exchange rate can deviate substantially from its long-run equilibrium.
>
> ③ Impossible trinity (trilemma)  
>> ○ Definition: free capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and an independent monetary policy cannot all coexist simultaneously.
