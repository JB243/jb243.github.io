**3.** Income inequality

### **1. Factor 1. Finance**

#### (1) Finance → Economic growth

> ① **Mechanism 1.** Improving the efficiency of allocating funds **:** pooling small savings to supply the funds needed for large-scale investments with higher productivity  
>
> ② **Mechanism 2.** Providing funding for education investment **:** by lowering investment costs, it promotes highly productive investment in physical and human capital  
>
> ③ Empirical research **:** as of 1960  
>
>> ○ Per-capita income in the bottom 20% of countries increased by 1.2% per year between 1960 and 2000  
>>
>> ○ Per-capita income in the top 20% of countries increased by 3.2% per year over the same period  

#### (2) Economic growth → Financial development

> ① As the economy grows, financial deepening occurs  
>
> ② IT innovation in the real sector → financial development **:** fintech

### **2. Factor 2. Aging**

#### (1) Korea’s current status

> ① In 2000, the share of the elderly in the total population reached 7.2%, entering an “aging society”  
>
> ② In 2018, the share of the elderly exceeded 14%, entering an “aged society”  
>
> ③ In 2026, the share of the elderly is expected to reach 20%, entering a “super-aged society”  

#### (2) Aging → Deterioration of economic growth

> ① **Mechanism 1.** A decline in both the quantity and quality of the labor force  
>
> ② **Mechanism 2.** A decline in overall savings in society  
>
>> ○ The share of younger people who save decreases  
>>
>> ○ The share of older people who have negative savings increases **:** reduced capital accumulation  

#### (3) Solutions **:** ways to improve the quantity or quality of labor

> ① Increase women’s labor force participation  
>
> ② Inflow of overseas labor  
>
> ③ Extend the retirement age  
>
> ④ Improve labor quality  

#### (4) Empirical research **:** study of the major seven countries (G7)

> ① Short-run evidence **:** effective labor supply decreases, reducing real GDP per capita  
>
> ② Long-run evidence **:** investment in human capital increases (**∵** lifelong education, etc.), raising labor productivity and GDP per capita

### **3. Factor 3. Income Inequality**

#### (1) Income inequality → Economic growth

> ① In imperfect capital markets, small entrepreneurs and low-income households facing credit constraints find it difficult to carry out appropriate levels of physical-capital investment and human-capital investment, respectively  
>
> ② Political and social instability increases, crime rises, and the costs of prevention increase  

#### (2) **Solution 1.** Intergenerational/class mobility

> ① Mobility between social classes matters more than income inequality itself  
>
> ② Education, in particular, increases mobility  

#### (3) **Solution 2.** Income redistribution policies

> ① Policies to mitigate inequality in market income that arises as a result of economic growth  
>
> ② Taxes and cash transfers **:** different effects  
>
>> ○ High levels of taxes and subsidies → reduced incentives to invest and reduced labor supply  
>>
>> ○ Reduced political and social instability → positive effects on investment  
>>
>>> ○ Increased education and health spending among low-income groups  
>>>
>>> ○ Easier to form social consensus when a crisis occurs  

#### (4) **Solution 3.** Fiscal policy for inclusive growth

> ① Support improved access to education services, etc., so that many economic agents can have opportunities to contribute to economic growth  
>
> ② A long-term approach that generally takes a relatively long time for results to appear  

#### (5) Empirical research

> ① In the U.S., redistribute 6% of GDP by having the top 30% income group support the bottom 70%  
>
> ② It is estimated that the U.S. long-run economic growth rate rises by 0.5% due to increased human-capital investment among lower-income groups, etc.
