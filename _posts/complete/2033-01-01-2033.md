## 1. Population

⑴ **Population**: All individuals of a species living in a particular area.

⑵ Density fluctuations in populations

> ① Factors of increase: High birth rate, immigration

> ② Factors of decrease: High death rate, emigration

⑶ Survival of populations

> ① Human survivorship type (Type I): High death rate in old age

> ② Hydra survivorship curve (Type II)

> ③ Oyster survivorship curve (Type III): High death rate in youth

⑷ Population Structure

> ① Population structure: characteristics of density (abundance) and spatial distribution (dispersion)

> ② Measuring population size: census, mark–recapture, quadrat method, line-transect method, belt-transect method, etc.

>> ○ Quadrat method: place a quadrat frame over the study area and count individuals within it.

**Figure 1.** Quadrat method

<br>

>>> ○ Density = number of individuals ÷ total area; A = 10/25, B = 4/25, C = 6/25

>>> ○ Relative density = number of individuals ÷ total number of individuals; A = 10/20, B = 4/20, C = 6/20

>>> ○ Frequency = number of quadrats in which the species occurs ÷ total number of quadrats; A = 6/25, B = 4/25, C = 6/25

>>> ○ Cover = area occupied by a species ÷ total area

>>> ○ Importance = sum of relative density, relative frequency, and relative cover

>>> ○ Species richness

>>> ○ Species diversity

>>> ○ Dominant species: the species with the greatest importance; i.e., a species with high biomass or many individuals that exerts major effects on the community

>>> ○ Keystone species: a species whose extinction would have the greatest impact on the ecosystem; i.e., one with relatively few individuals but a large ecological effect

>>> ○ Indicator species: a species found only (or characteristically) in a particular community

>>> ○ Rare species: a species with few individuals within the community

>>> ○ Foundation species: a species whose predator's removal can lead to the disappearance of other species

>>> ○ Pioneer species: a species that creates or modifies habitat conditions in a new site (e.g., beavers)

> ③ Spatial distributions of populations

>> ○ Clumped (aggregated) distribution: high density where resources are abundant

>> ○ Uniform (regular) distribution: associated with territorial behavior

>> ○ Random distribution: seen in nonsocial species with broad environmental tolerance; no specific drivers of pattern

> ④ Allee effect: the principle that populations have an optimal density 

>> ○ Very low densities can reduce growth or survival.

>> ○ Relatedly, population size is proportional to habitat area.

⑸ Exponential Growth Model

> ① Growth rate (r): the percentage change in the size of a population over one year

>> ○ r = birth rate − death rate

>> ○ Birth and death rates are constants: the numbers of births and deaths are assumed to increase in proportion to population size.

> ② Population size (S) = S<sub>0</sub>(1 + r)<sup>n</sup>

>> ○ S<sub>0</sub>: initial population size

>> ○ n: number of years elapsed since the reference year

> ③ <b>Limitation 1.</b> Excessive population growth leads to high mortality: risk of extinction is high.

>> ○ Density-dependent factors: resource shortages, increased disease, increased pollutants

>> ○ Density-independent factors: events such as drought, extreme temperatures, and natural disasters

> ④ <b>Limitation 2.</b> There is a time lag between individual birth and reproduction → environmental effects do not appear immediately.

>> ○ Demographic inertia: the time lag between when the birth rate declines and when population growth begins to decrease

⑹ Logistic Growth Model: addresses <b>Limitation 1</b>

> ① Assumes that the per-unit-time population growth rate is affected by population size and environmental resistance.

>> ○ Carrying capacity (K): the maximum population the environment can support

>> ○ Environmental resistance: for population size N, corresponds to 1 − K/N

>> ○ ∴ dN/dt = rN(1 − N/K)

> ② r-selection: high population growth rate; small body size; many offspring; short generation time

>> ○ Environmental resistance is close to zero, so growth roughly follows a J-shaped exponential model: density-independent growth

>> ○ Features of the J shape: reproduction-oriented; short lifespan; small body size

> ③ K-selection: low population growth rate; large body size; few but high-quality offspring

>> ○ As the population approaches carrying capacity, the growth rate nears zero.

>> ○ Long lifespan and large body size; repeated reproduction; long developmental time; intense competition among individuals

>> ○ K-selected organisms tend to reproduce at older ages; they have fewer offspring and populations are smaller.

⑺ Demographic transition: when the birth rate remains unchanged but the death rate declines, the growth rate increases

> ① Before the Industrial Revolution: most countries had both high birth and high death rates.

> ② After the Industrial Revolution: improved sanitation and advances in medicine reduced death rates.

> ③ The time lag between death rates and birth rates has a major impact on population size.

> ④ Many developing countries are in the demographic transition phase → implementation of family-planning policies.

> ⑤ Developed countries have passed through the transition and have low population growth rates → childcare/education welfare and immigration policies.

## 2. Community

⑴ Community: the assemblage of all living populations inhabiting a given area.

⑵ Food web: the network of who-eats-whom relationships.

> ① Ecological niche (niche): the role an organism occupies in an ecosystem—the sum of the biotic and abiotic resources it uses.

>> ○ Influenced by habitat and by diet/feeding mode.

>> ○ A species' fundamental niche and realized niche can differ depending on environmental conditions.

> ② Species within a community occupy unique ecological niches and interact with one another.

>> ○ Ecotype: distinct forms that arise when the same species adapts to different environments.

> ③ Interactions in a community

>> ○ <b>Interaction 1.</b> Mutualism (+/+): both interacting species benefit.

>>> ○ <b>Examples:</b> bees and flowering plants; large fishes and cleaner fish; ants and acacia trees.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> root-nodule bacteria in legumes.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> nutrient exchange between fungi and plant roots in mycorrhizae.

>> ○ <b>Interaction 2.</b> Commensalism (+/0): only one species benefits, the other is unaffected.

>> ○ <b>Interaction 3.</b> Predation (+/−): a predator consumes a prey organism.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> plant → insect → bird.

>>> ○ Lotka–Volterra model: when predator–prey relations are simple, population sizes oscillate.

<br>

<img width="559" height="283" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/135d8f0c-d622-40f2-900e-51b6345372c3" />

**Figure. 4.** Lotka-Volterra model 

>>> ○ Mathematical formulation: for n<sub>i</sub> (population size of the i-th population), r<sub>i</sub> (weight), and A<sub>i←j</sub> (interaction coefficient representing how the j-th population affects the i-th population), dn<sub>i</sub>/dt = n<sub>i</sub> ( r<sub>i</sub> + Σ<sub>j</sub> A<sub>i←j</sub> n<sub>j</sub>).

>> ○ <b>Interaction 4.</b> Parasitism (+/−): a relationship in which a parasite obtains nutrients from its host.

>>> ○ Endoparasites: tapeworms, malaria, etc.

>>> ○ Ectoparasites: ticks, etc.

>> ○ <b>Interaction 5.</b> Amensalism (0/−): a relationship in which only one species is harmed.

>> ○ <b>Interaction 6.</b> Competition (−/−): competing for the same resources.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> mosquitoes, snails, and tadpoles compete for pond resources.

>> ○ <b>Supplement 1.</b> Competitive Exclusion Principle

>>> ○ Two populations compete for limited resources; if the competition intensifies, competitive exclusion may occur.

>>> ○ Competitive exclusion: one species monopolizes food and space resources so that another species cannot establish.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> a strategy to prevent <i>S. enteritidis</i> from colonizing the chick's intestine.

>>>> ○ Chicks hatch with intestines essentially free of bacteria.

>>>> ○ Untreated: few or no bacteria in the gut → <i>S. enteritidis</i> infection proceeds actively.

>>>> ○ Ingestion of beneficial bacteria: large colonies of beneficial bacteria form on the inner intestinal surface.

>>>> ○ Expose to <i>Salmonella enteritidis</i>.

>>>> ○ Untreated: <i>S. enteritidis</i> infection proceeds actively.

>>>> ○ Ingestion of beneficial bacteria: <i>S. enteritidis</i> fails to find space to form colonies and is excreted.

>> ○ <b>Supplement 2.</b> Mimicry

>>> ○ Batesian mimicry: a palatable, harmless species imitates an unpalatable, harmful model.

>>> ○ Müllerian mimicry: two or more unpalatable species resemble each other, prompting predators to avoid all of them.

>> ○ <b>Supplement 3.</b> Hamilton's Rule

>>> ○ B: the benefit to the recipient, i.e., the expected number of offspring if the recipient survives.

>>> ○ C: the cost to the altruist, i.e., the reduction in offspring due to death (or other costs) from the altruistic act.

>>> ○ r: the coefficient of relatedness between individuals, i.e., the probability of sharing a particular allele.

>>> ○ Altruism is favored when B × r > C.

>> ○ <b>Supplement 4.</b> Edge Effect

>>> ○ The edges of available habitat patches exhibit characteristics different from the interior.

>>> ○ <b>Trait 1:</b> at edges, the frequency of competition with adjacent habitats increases.

>>> ○ <b>Trait 2:</b> if the habitat is forest, wind exposure increases, temperature rises, humidity decreases, and light intensity increases.

>>> ○ As a result, edge species and species from adjacent habitats are favored over interior specialists.

>> ○ <b>Supplement 5.</b> Habitat Fragmentation

>>> ○ Definition: through human activities and other causes, habitats are progressively destroyed so that the remaining habitats become smaller and more isolated.

>>> ○ <b>Outcome 1:</b> only populations able to live in small habitats can persist.

>>> ○ <b>Outcome 2:</b> edge effects increase.

> ④ Roles within a community: producers, consumers (predators), decomposers

>> ○ Producers: raise the energy level of the community; green plants that synthesize organic matter from inorganic substances.

>> ○ Consumers: lower the energy level of the community; animals that obtain energy by consuming organic matter.

>> ○ Decomposers: lower the energy level of the community; organisms that live by decomposing the carcasses and excreta of plants and animals, primarily microorganisms.

> ⑤ Keystone species: species that play a pivotal role in structuring the food web.

>> ○ <b>Example:</b> sea stars feed on mussels; without the keystone sea star, mussel populations explode and disrupt the ecosystem.

> ⑥ Ecosystem energy flow: only ~10% at each trophic level is converted into biomass at the next level.

>> ○ The amount of solar energy and the availability of water are key drivers of energy flow.

>> ○ Biodiversity also influences energy flow.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> grasslands generate large amounts of biomass.

> ⑶ Nutrient Cycling: Recycling of inorganic nutrients through the food web

> ① Nutrient Efficiency: The ratio of energy transferred from one trophic level to the next, typically around 10%.

> ② Nitrogen Cycling

<br>

**Figure 5.** Nitrogen Cycling 

<br>

>> ○ Nitrogen Fixation and Others: Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) → Ammonia (NH3) → Ammonium (NH4+)

>>> ○ **Case 1:** High-energy fixation (lightning, meteorite)

>>> ○ **Case 2:** Nitrogen fixation (anaerobic conditions): Soil bacteria, rhizobia, azotobacter, cyanobacteria

>>> ○ **Case 3:** Nitrogen from corpses or waste products

>> ○ Nitrification Process: Ammonium (NH4+) → Nitrite (NO2-) → Nitrate (NO3-)

>>> ○ Nitrosomonas: Ammonium (NH4+) → Nitrite (NO2-)

>>> ○ Nitrobacter: Nitrite (NO2-) → Nitrate (NO3-)

>>> ○ Chemical synthesis: Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter synthesize sugar using energy released during oxidation of organic matter.

>> ○ Denitrification Process: Nitrate (NO3-) → Nitrogen gas (N2)

>>> ○ Denitrifying bacteria: Nitrate (NO3-) → Nitrogen gas (N2). Anaerobic heterotrophs. In the respiratory electron transport chain, they use nitrite and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors instead of oxygen.

>> ○ Plants can use either Ammonium (NH4+) or Nitrate (NO3-).

> ③ When phytoplankton increase, decomposers consume more oxygen to break down their dead biomass, leading to deterioration of water quality.

⑷ Extinction

> ① Extinction: when a species disappears completely.

> ② Measuring extinction rates

>> ○ Extinction rate: the percentage of all species that go extinct in a given year.

>> ○ Background extinction rate: the rate at which species disappear through normal evolutionary processes; 0.0001% per year.

>> ○ Current extinction rate: 0.0037% per year, clearly suggesting the involvement of human activities.

> ③ <b>Cause 1.</b> Habitat destruction

>> ○ Population growth increases pressure on natural areas.

>> ○ Species–area curve: the number of species a natural area can support.

> ④ <b>Cause 2.</b> Habitat fragmentation

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Reduces the area available to producers in the food chain.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Top consumers need many calories and large home ranges, increasing environmental pressure.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Decline in the population size of top consumers.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Inbreeding among top consumers accelerates extinction.

> ⑤ <b>Cause 3.</b> Invasive species

>> ○ Invasive (non-native) species: species newly introduced through human activities.

>> ○ Because they did not coevolve with local species, they often lack natural enemies and are destructive.

>> ○ <b>Examples:</b> bluegill, American bullfrog, red-eared slider.

> ⑥ <b>Cause 4.</b> Overharvesting: using natural resources at a rate exceeding their reproductive capacity.

> ⑦ <b>Cause 5.</b> Pollution

>> ○ Herbicides: threaten frogs and salamanders.

>> ○ Use of agricultural fertilizers → eutrophication of waterways leading to algal overgrowth → oxygen depletion → mass fish die-offs.

>> ○ Carbon dioxide: an air pollutant associated with climate change.

> ⑧ <b>Cause 6.</b> Inbreeding: the Great Irish Potato Famine (1847–1852) is a representative case.

>> ○ At the time, the 'Lumper' variety, a South American import, was cultivated.

>> ○ Extinction mechanism: positive feedback.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Small populations → inbreeding, genetic drift.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Inbreeding and genetic drift → loss of genetic variation.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Loss of genetic variation → reduced fitness and population adaptability.

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Reduced fitness and adaptability → high mortality, low reproduction.

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. High mortality and low reproduction → even smaller populations.

>> ○ Potato famine mechanism

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Potatoes were propagated asexually → genetic diversity = 0.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The late blight fungus arrived and potatoes rotted in the fields.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Collapse (extinction) of the potato crop.

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Of 9 million people, 1.5 million died and 1 million emigrated to North America.

## 3. Ecosystem

⑴ Ecosystems and Biomes

> ① Ecosystem: Abiotic environmental factors (light, temperature, water, air, soil) + biotic environmental factors.

> ② Biome: A typical ecosystem spread over a broad region.

>> ○ A biome is a wide geographic area characterized by the dominant form(s) of vegetation.

> ③ Energy in ecosystems

>> ○ Gross primary production (GPP): The total amount of organic matter produced by producers via photosynthesis; i.e., GPP = respiration + net primary production.

>> ○ Net primary production (NPP): GPP minus the respiration of photosynthetic organisms.

>>> ○ NPP can be subdivided into biomass consumed by herbivores, plant mortality, leaf-litter (litterfall), and growth increment.

>> ○ Ingestion by primary consumers: equal to the amount of producer biomass consumed.

>>> ○ The fate of primary consumers' ingestion can be subdivided into respiration, excretion, carcass (mortality), and growth, etc.

>> ○ Net community production (NCP): NPP minus heterotrophs' respiration.

>> ○ Production efficiency = growth ÷ ingestion.

>>> ○ Homeotherms (endotherms) have low production efficiency because much energy is used to maintain body temperature.

> ④ Trophic (ecological) pyramids

>> ○ Pyramid of numbers: diagrams the number of individuals at each trophic level.

>> ○ Pyramid of biomass: graphs biomass (dry mass); clearly reflects the food chain.

>> ○ Pyramid of energy: shows energy flow and losses between trophic levels.

> ④ Ecosystem development (plant succession)

>> ○ <b>Stage 1.</b> Succession: Changes in plant communities over time at the same site.

>> ○ <b>Stage 1-1.</b> Primary succession: Succession starting where no plant community previously existed; lichens become the dominant species.

>> ○ <b>Stage 1-2.</b> Secondary succession: Succession beginning after disturbance (e.g., wildfire) where soil nutrients and some community remnants remain; herbaceous plants become dominant.

>> ○ <b>Stage 2.</b> Herbaceous plants → shrubs → trees.

>> ○ <b>Stage 3.</b> Light-demanding forest: shade-intolerant species appear.
　
>>> ○ Definition: plants adapted to strong light.

>>> ○ Traits: high light-compensation point and high light-saturation point.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> pines.

>> ○ <b>Stage 4.</b> Shade-tolerant forest: shade-adapted species appear.

>>> ○ Definition: plants adapted to weak light.

>>> ○ Traits: low light-compensation point and low light-saturation point.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> oaks.

>> ○ <b>Stage 5.</b> Extreme: the final stage of ecosystem development.

>>> ○ Shade-intolerant species appear first, followed by shade-adapted species.

>>> ○ Species diversity increases in early stages and then decreases again later.

 ⑵ Terrestrial Biomes: Determined by vegetation types - forests, grasslands, deserts, tundras

> ① Vegetation: Plant cover over the ground, "climate → vegetation" (∴ altitude, latitude dependent)

> ② Forests: Dominated by woody plants, cover about 1/3 of the Earth's land surface and 70% of the Earth's biomass.

> ②―① Tropical Rainforest: Strong sunlight, year-round 25-29°C, high rainfall (2500 + α mm), near or equatorial regions

>> ○ High biodiversity, 750 species of woody plants per hectare **→** diverse habitats

>> ○ Rapid decomposition of organic matter, plants rapidly reabsorb decomposed matter **→** organic material stored in soil decreases

>>> ○ Inorganic nutrients mostly fixed by plants, not suitable for agriculture without heavy fertilization

>>> ○ Lifespan of tropical forest farming is only 4-5 years, recovery takes decades

>> ○ Tropical communities older than other communities → longer speciation periods → higher biodiversity↑

>>> ○ Generally, higher evaporation leads to greater biodiversity.

> ②-② Temperate Forest (Forest): During the growing season, there is sufficient water (750 ~ 2500 mm) and light, but during winter ×, North-South 23° ~ 50°

>> ○ Dominant Species: Deciduous Trees

>> ○ General Succession: Weeds **→** Shrubs **→** Deciduous Trees **→** Deciduous Trees + Understory Plants

>> ○ Region: Northern Hemisphere Mid-Latitudes, Australia

>> ○ Deciduous: Evolution of leaf-shedding adaptation for moisture conservation, pigments that were previously hidden by sugars and chlorophyll are revealed during leaf decomposition

>> (Tannins, Anthocyanins, Carotenoids, etc.) lead to fall foliage

>> ○ Understory plants grow rapidly and bloom while light is available

> ②-③ Coniferous Forest or Boreal Forest (Forest): Winter -50 ℃, Summer 20 ℃, 300-700 mm, Exist near the poles (North America, Asia, Northern Europe)

>> ○ Dominant Species: Conifers (e.g., Pine, Spruce)

>> ****○ Largest group of organisms on Earth

>> ○ Adaptation to long cold winters and humid summers

>> ○ Evergreen Adaptation: Photosynthesis is limited in winter × **→** Chlorophyll is exposed when ice melts, enabling immediate photosynthesis

> ②-④ Mediterranean Shrubland (Forest): Spring 10-12 ℃, Summer 30 ℃, Annual 300-500 mm (dry in summer), Mediterranean, Southern California, Southwestern Australia

>> ○ Dominant Species: Evergreen Shrubs (e.g., Olive, Fig)

>> ○ Adaptation to long dry summers and frequent fires → Fire adaptation (e.g., seeds germinate after exposure to high heat)

>>> ○ Example: Mediterranean regions experience hot and dry summers, and cool and wet winters

> ③ Grassland: Precipitation 250 ~ 500 mm, Dry months 8 ~ 9, Dominant in grasses

>> ○ **Example 1.** Savannah: Tropical, Subtropical, Tropical Grasslands

>>> ○ Warm throughout the year

>> ○ **Example 2.** Prairie: Temperate Grasslands (e.g., African Savanna, Hungarian Puszta, American Great Plains)

>>> ○ Winter averages below -10 ℃, Summer averages around 30 ℃

>> ○ Dominant Species: Dominant growth from the base where herbivores nibble plants

>> ○ During dry periods, periodic fires; during wet periods, restoration of grassland vegetation

> ④ Desert: Average 24 ~ 29 ℃, Precipitation less than 250 mm, Near latitudes 30° North/South

>> ○ Significant temperature variations: -30 ~ 50 ℃

>> ○ One-year life cycle: Adaptation to a complete life history in 2 ~ 3 weeks of rainy season

>> ○ Plant Adaptations: Wax coatings, thorns, water storage in stem, adaptation to frequent fires

>> ○ Desert Animal Adaptations: Kangaroo Rat, Nocturnal, Water loss prevention

>>> ○ Example: Kangaroo Rats are nocturnal, survive on metabolic water from breaking down fats in seeds

> ⑤ Tundra: Winter below -30 ℃, Short summer, below 10 ℃

>> ○ Example: Northern Norway, Northern Canada

>> ○ Plant growing season: About 2 months (50 ~ 60 days) in summer

>> ○ Permafrost: Frozen ground, inhibits plant growth by preventing drainage

>> ○ Plants grow low and flat due to strong winds and low temperatures

>> ○ Effects of global warming: Some tundra areas are transitioning to coniferous forests

>> ○ Tundra Animal Adaptations: Fat storage, fur, feather development, hibernation, migratory birds

 ⑶ Aquatic Ecosystem

> ① Freshwater: Salinity below 0.1%

> ①-① Lakes and Ponds (Freshwater): Bodies of water surrounded by land

>> ○ May dry up seasonally, important habitats for frogs and dragonflies

>> ○ Seasonal changes in wind and temperature drive nutrient cycling in lakes and ponds

>> ○ Eutrophication due to fertilizers on surrounding soil causing algal blooms

> ①-② Rivers and Streams (Freshwater): Flowing bodies of water in one direction

>> ○ Upper reaches: Clean and fast-flowing

>> ○ Middle reaches: Warmer, support growth of diverse aquatic life and algae

>> ○ Lower reaches: Flow slowly to the sea, sediment-rich, low light penetration, decreased photosynthesis, increased decomposers, low dissolved oxygen, benthic feeders increase

> ①-③ Wetlands (Freshwater): Areas where aquatic plants grow

>> ○ Difference from lakes and ponds: Soil surrounding wetlands contains a lot of water

>> ○ Many species, like tropical rainforests

>> ○ Functions: Slow water flow to control flooding, filter toxins and sediment

>> ○ Over 50% of wetlands in the US have been lost or destroyed

> ② Marine Ecosystems: Humans have altered 50% of Earth's surface

> ① Energy and Natural Resources

>> ○ Energy use (e.g., fossil fuels): Importing energy resources results in environmental degradation

>> ○ Natural Resources: Require a lot of natural materials for sustenance like food, housing, water

>> ○ Ecological Footprint: Land area needed to support human activities is much larger than actual area

> ② Waste Production

>> ○ Water Pollution: Factories release solid waste as sludge, chemicals as industrial wastewater **→** Advanced countries have better sewage treatment

>> ○ Waste: Most solid waste ends up in landfills (in developed countries) or open areas (in developing countries)

> ③ Air Pollution

>> ○ Primary Pollutants: Emitted from burning fossil fuels like coal and oil
