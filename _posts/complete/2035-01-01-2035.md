**1. (Reference) The IS–LM Model**

⑴ **Limitation 1.** A model with a fixed price level

⑵ **Limitation 2.** No consideration of aggregate supply at all

---

**2. Aggregate Demand** (aggregate demand; AD)

⑴ Why the aggregate demand curve slopes downward

> ① Substitution effect **:** Not applicable in macroeconomics (**#**)

> ② Interest-rate effect **:** Price level falls → real money supply increases → interest rate falls → private consumption and investment increase → aggregate demand increases

> ③ Real balance effect **:** Also called the Pigou effect, wealth effect, or asset effect  
>> ○ Definition **:** The effect in which the value of assets influences consumption  
>> ○ Price level falls → the real purchasing power of money increases → real wealth (A/P) increases → consumption increases

> ④ Current account effect **:** Price level falls → international competitiveness of domestic goods improves → net exports increase → aggregate demand increases

⑵ The aggregate demand curve

> ① The slope of the AD curve  
>> ○ The larger the interest-rate effect, the flatter the AD curve  
>>> ○ Higher interest elasticity of investment ↑ → IS curve becomes flatter → AD curve becomes flatter  
>>> ○ Lower interest elasticity of money demand ↓ → LM curve becomes steeper → AD curve becomes flatter  
>> ○ The larger the real balance effect, the flatter the AD curve  
>> ○ The larger the current account effect, the flatter the AD curve

> ② A rightward shift of the IS curve or a rightward shift of the LM curve = a rightward shift of the AD curve

> ③ However, a fall in the price level does **not** shift the AD curve **:** because that is a movement along the curve (a point moves)

**3. Aggregate Supply**

⑴ The labor market

> ① Labor demand  
>> ○ An increase in the real wage reduces labor demand  
>> ○ **#** An increase in the overall price level means that all output prices rise, so it does not reduce demand

> ② [Labor demand curve](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2039) **:** The curve for firms’ labor demand, calculated using the value of marginal product

> ③ [Labor supply curve](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2039) **:** The curve describing how much labor workers supply at a given wage

⑵ **Theory 1.** Money-illusion theory

> ① Overview  
>> ○ Proposed by Keynes  
>> ○ An upward-sloping aggregate supply curve can be derived if **either** of the following two assumptions holds  
>> ○ Explains why the AS curve slopes upward by focusing on the **labor supply market**

> ② **Assumption 1. Money illusion** **:** Because expected price level Pe and actual price level P differ, workers mistake changes in the nominal wage W = P·w for changes in the real wage (i.e., static expectations about the price level)  
>> ○ Labor supply **:** Even if the price level rises, unless the nominal wage changes, the labor supply curve does not change  
>> ○ Labor demand **:** Firms face the real wage; therefore, if prices fall, the labor demand curve shifts left  
>> ○ **Conclusion 1.** Labor supply is a function of the nominal wage. Labor demand is a function of the real wage  
>> ○ **Conclusion 2.** Equilibrium employment is determined entirely by labor demand

> ③ **Assumption 2. Downward rigidity of nominal wages**

**Figure. 1.** Downward rigidity of nominal wages

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Labor contracts are not made continuously; they are signed for fixed periods  
>> ○ **Reason 2.** In the labor market, workers do not accept nominal wage cuts (downward rigidity in the labor market)  
>> ○ **Reason 3.** When output is low, idle capacity exists, so even if output increases the nominal wage does not increase (to be revised later)

>> ○ Labor supply **:** Because of downward rigidity of nominal wages, labor supply does not change even if prices fall  
>> ○ Labor demand **:** Firms face the real wage; therefore, if prices fall, the labor demand curve shifts left  
>> ○ **Conclusion 1.** Labor supply is a function of the nominal wage. Labor demand is a function of the real wage  
>> ○ **Conclusion 2.** Equilibrium employment is determined entirely by labor demand

> ④ The short-run aggregate supply curve  
>> ○ Labor supply is an increasing function of the real wage **:** using **money illusion** and **nominal wage rigidity**  
>> ○ Short-run aggregate supply curve

**Figure. 2.** Short-run aggregate supply curve under the money-illusion theory]

>> ○ When the price level falls  
>>> ○ 1st. Price level falls (P0 → P1), nominal wage unchanged  
>>> ○ 2nd. Real wage rises (w0 → w1)  
>>> ○ 3rd. Quantity of labor demanded falls (L0 → L1)  
>>> ○ 4th. Employment falls (L0 → L1)  
>>> ○ 5th. Total output falls (Y0 → Y1)

>> ○ When the price level rises  
>>> ○ 1st. Price level rises  
>>> ○ 2nd. Nominal wage rises **:** there is no upward rigidity of nominal wages  
>>> ○ 3rd. The real wage stays at a constant level

> ⑤ The long-run aggregate supply curve

**Figure. 3.** Long-run aggregate supply curve under the money-illusion theory]

>> ○ The money-illusion theory applies only in the short run; in the long run the AS curve is vertical at the full-employment level of output  
>> ○ In the long run, imperfect price information diminishes and workers’ expected price level becomes accurate

> ⑥ Limitations  
>> ○ Theoretical foundations for nominal wage rigidity and money illusion are weak  
>> ○ An upward-sloping aggregate supply curve can be derived even when price variables are flexible

⑶ **Theory 2.** Lucas’s rational expectations theory

> ① Overview  
>> ○ Proposed by Lucas (Robert E. Lucas, Jr.)  
>> ○ Lucas received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1995 for his work on rational expectations  
>> ○ Explains why the AS curve slopes upward by focusing on the **labor demand curve**  
>> ○ As a new classical economist, Lucas assumes the long-run AS curve is vertical at the natural level of output **:** it can slope upward in the short run

> ② Assumption **:** Under rational expectations, output can change due to imperfect information about the price level  
>> ○ (Reference) Perfect expectation **:** expectations that always match actual outcomes; an assumption of classical economists  
>> ○ (Reference) Static expectation **:** expecting the future to continue like the past  
>>> ○ Money illusion occurs  
>>> ○ Under static expectations (or money illusion), expected and unexpected price changes are not distinguished  
>> ○ (Reference) Adaptive expectation **:** forecasting current/future prices based on past experience  
>>> ○ No ex-ante adjustment ×, ex-post adjustment ○  
>> ○ Rational expectation **:** forming expectations about future prices rationally using all currently available information  
>>> ○ Ex-ante adjustment ○, ex-post adjustment ○  
>>> ○ Rational expectations do not mean perfect foresight  
>>> ○ Under rational expectations, expected and unexpected price changes are not distinguished

> ③ Idea  
>> ○ If the overall price level rises, individual firms have no reason to increase output  
>> ○ If only the price of the good a firm produces rises, the firm should increase output  
>> ○ Each firm cannot know whether the rise in its product price reflects general inflation or a relative-price change  
>> ○ **Lucas’s contribution** **:** Even with rational expectations, imperfect information in the goods market makes the AS curve slope upward

> ④ Formalization **:** If a firm’s product price is high relative to the general price level, it increases output to maximize profit  
>> ○ Yi **:** output of firm i  
>> ○ Yi* **:** normal output level of firm i  
>> ○ Pi **:** price of firm i’s good  
>> ○ P **:** general price level of the overall economy  
>> ○ γ **:** sensitivity of firm i’s output to changes in the relative price  
>> ○ Individual firms cannot perfectly distinguish relative-price changes from changes in the general price level

> ⑤ Meaning of γ  
>> ○ If γ is close to 0 **:** the AS curve is very steep; aggregate output does not change much  
>> ○ If γ is very large **:** the AS curve is very flat; aggregate output changes a lot  
>> ○ Countries where governments frequently used unanticipated monetary/financial policies in the past **:** γ is small  
>> ○ Economies with pervasive uncertainty about the future **:** γ is small (**∵** firms respond conservatively)

> ⑥ Government policy  
>> ○ Both fiscal and monetary policies can temporarily raise output in the short run and raise prices  
>> ○ Neither fiscal nor monetary policy has effects in the long run

> ⑦ Policy ineffectiveness proposition  
>> ○ Anticipated monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy raise the price level but cannot increase income even in the short run  
>> ○ Unlike anticipated monetary policy, anticipated expansionary fiscal policy affects the composition of aggregate-demand spending

⑷ **Theory 3.** The New Keynesian aggregate supply curve **:** also called the price-rigidity model

> ① Overview **:** Explains why the AS curve slopes upward by focusing on the **labor demand curve**

> ② Formalization  
>> ○ Firms under monopolistic competition set prices, so there are two groups of firms  
>> ○ **Group 1. Flexible-price firms** **:** adjust prices flexibly as economic conditions change  
>> ○ **Group 2. Sticky-price firms** **:** form rational expectations about the price level; when conditions change, they keep prices unchanged and respond via changes in output  
>>> ○ If the cost of adjusting prices is sufficiently large (menu costs), income becomes an increasing function of the price level  
>>> ○ The menu-cost concept was proposed by Mankiw  
>> ○ Derivation of the AS curve  
>>> ○ s **:** share of sticky-price firms; in new classical approaches (e.g., Lucas), s = 0  
>>> ○ α **:** responsiveness of flexible-price firms

> ③ Significance **:** Even if policy is anticipated, the existence of firms that keep prices sticky allows macroeconomic policies to have effects in the short run

**Figure. 4.** Significance of the New Keynesian aggregate supply curve

⑸ Applications

> ① Short run vs. long run  
>> ○ Short run **:** price variables are sticky; a short period in which expectations do not fully adjust  
>> ○ Short-run AS curve **:** upward sloping  
>>> ○ **Case 1.** Productivity improves → AS curve shifts right  
>>> ○ **Case 2.** Labor supply decreases due to labor unions → AS curve shifts left  
>> ○ Long run **:** a sufficiently long period for expectations to fully adjust  
>> ○ Long-run AS curve **:** vertical at the natural level of output

> ② Positions by school  
>> ○ A general AS curve  
>> ○ Keynes model **:** horizontal supply curve, implying the existence of idle capacity  
>> ○ Keynesians **:** relatively flat slope  
>> ○ Monetarists **:** relatively steep slope  
>> ○ Classical economists **:** AS curve is vertical in both the long run and the short run

**4. Equilibrium of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply**

⑴ Shifts of the aggregate supply curve

> ① Changes in climate conditions such as droughts in an agrarian society **:** marginal product of labor falls → labor demand falls → AS curve shifts left

> ② International oil price increases **:** firms reduce energy usage → marginal product of labor (a complementary input) falls → labor demand falls → AS curve shifts left

> ③ Wage-increase demands by labor unions **:** labor supply falls → AS curve shifts left

⑵ Examples of equilibrium analysis

> ① Increase (decrease) in the price level  
>> ○ Goods market **:** real exchange rate falls (rises) → net exports fall (rise) → IS curve shifts left (right)  
>> ○ Money market **:** real money supply falls (rises) → LM curve shifts left (right)  
>> ○ Labor market **:** labor supply increases (decreases) due to money illusion → labor supply curve shifts right (left)  
>> ○ In the AD–AS diagram, this appears as a **movement along** the curves **:** not a shift of the curves

> ② Increase in autonomous investment  
>> ○ 1st. IS curve shifts right  
>> ○ 2nd. AD curve shifts right  
>> ○ 3rd. As prices rise, the real money supply decreases  
>> ○ 4th. LM curve shifts left  
>> ○ 5th. Due to money illusion, Ls shifts right  
>> ○ **Conclusion 1.** Income rises, prices rise, investment rises  
>> ○ **Conclusion 2.** As the interest rate rises, investment partially falls  
>> ○ **Conclusion 3.** From Y = C + I + G, we can see that I ultimately increases

> ③ Increase in total factor productivity  
>> ○ 1st. Ld shifts right  
>> ○ 2nd. AS curve shifts right  
>> ○ 3rd. As prices fall, the real money supply increases  
>> ○ 4th. LM curve shifts right  
>> ○ 5th. Due to money illusion, Ls shifts left  
>> ○ **Conclusion 1.** Income rises, employment rises, prices fall  
>> ○ **Conclusion 2.** Real wages rise, interest rates fall  
>> ○ **Conclusion 3.** Consumption and investment rise  
>> ○ **Conclusion 4.** Government spending is unchanged

⑶ Empirical analysis

**Table. 1.** Predictions of the AD–AS model and the data

> ① Aggregate demand shocks **:** based on changes in autonomous investment  
>> ○ Procyclical prices are due to increased autonomous investment  
>> ○ Countercyclical real wages are due to workers’ money illusion

> ② Aggregate supply shocks **:** based on changes in total factor productivity  
>> ○ Except for procyclical money supply, the comovements of major macro indicators are well explained  
>> ○ Real business cycle theory **:** a business-cycle theory that views changes in total factor productivity as a main cause of short-run fluctuations

⑷ The IMF financial crisis

> ① Macroeconomic policies required by the IMF **:** tight monetary policy (high interest rates) and fiscal austerity

> ② Tight monetary policy (high interest rate policy)  
>> ○ Maintaining high interest rates via tight policy brings in foreign capital **:** by eliminating currency speculation, the exchange rate stabilizes  
>> ○ Reduces consumption and investment, contributing to an improved current account  
>> ○ Prevents wasteful and duplicative overinvestment by large firms  
>> ○ Functions as an effective restructuring tool by forcing marginal firms into bankruptcy

> ③ Fiscal austerity  
>> ○ Improves the current account and stabilizes the exchange rate by reducing aggregate demand

> ④ Disadvantages  
>> ○ Excessively high interest rates can cause otherwise healthy firms to fail despite profitability (black insolvency)  
>> ○ High interest rates worsen corporate financial structure, making financial normalization difficult  
>> ○ Even if interest rates are raised, large capital inflows cannot be expected unless macro fundamentals improve  
>> ○ Reducing aggregate demand may improve the current account in the short run, but increases unemployment and further depresses the economy

⑸ Credit crunch

> ① Definition **:** a phenomenon in which liquidity is not properly supplied to the market

> ② **Example 1.** During the Great Depression of the 1930s  
>> ○ Investment does not respond sensitively to interest rates, so the IS curve is relatively steep

> ③ **Example 2.** When a socialist economy transitions to a market economy  
>> ○ 1st. After the transition, the economy grows rapidly  
>> ○ 2nd. Demand for funds needed for real investment increases greatly  
>> ○ 3rd. In a transition economy, capital markets such as stock and bond markets are underdeveloped, so the supply of funds falls short of demand  
>> ○ 4th. Liquidity is not properly supplied to the market

> ④ Countermeasures  
>> ○ Fundamentally, domestic financial institutions and markets must develop to match the scale of the economy  
>> ○ In the short run, foreign capital should be actively utilized (e.g., attracting foreign investment capital, introducing foreign loans)
