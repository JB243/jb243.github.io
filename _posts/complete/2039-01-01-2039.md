## **1. Factor markets (general)**

⑴ Background

> ① Goods market **:** households are the demand side; firms are the supply side  
> ② Factor market **:** firms are the demand side; households are the supply side  
> ③ Directly connected to the neoclassical theory of income distribution

⑵ Demand for factors of production

> ① **Interpretation 1.** It has the character of derived demand  
>> ○ Meaning **:** demand for factors is derived from demand for goods (MC)  
>> ○ Dividing a factor’s price by its marginal product has the meaning of marginal cost (MC)

> ② **Interpretation 2.** In a neoclassical perfectly competitive market, price represents marginal product **:** because **marginal revenue product is 0**  
>> ○ A perfectly competitive firm’s labor demand is determined where the nominal wage equals the value of the marginal product of labor  
>> ○ Marginal revenue product (marginal revenue product; MRP) **:** the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker  
>> ○ Value of marginal product (value of marginal product; VMP) **:** the factor’s marginal product multiplied by the output’s market price  
>> ○ (Note) You can understand VMP as MRP under perfect competition  
>> ○ Price of labor = value of the marginal product of labor (where *w* denotes the nominal wage)  
>> ○ Price of capital = value of the marginal product of capital (where *v* denotes nominal rent)

> ③ Labor demand curve  
>> ○ Assumption **:** labor is the only variable input  
>> ○ Downward-sloping **:** because the law of diminishing marginal product is assumed  
>> ○ Factors that increase labor demand  
>>> ○ Increase in demand for the product  
>>> ○ Increase in the productivity of a factor of production  
>>> ○ Increase in the price of an input that is a substitute  
>>> ○ Decrease in the price of an input that is a complement  
>>> ○ Increase in the number of producers  
>>> ○ (Note) Capital input can either increase or decrease labor demand

>> ○ Price elasticity of labor demand **:** also known as the Hicks–Marshall laws of derived demand  
>>> ○ Faster diminishing marginal product ↑ → labor demand curve becomes steeper → **elasticity ↓**  
>>> ○ Greater substitutability with other inputs ↑ → employment changes more → elasticity ↑  
>>> ○ Labor’s share in total cost ↑ → employment changes more easily and by a larger amount → elasticity ↑  
>>> ○ Price elasticity of demand for the product ↑ → since labor demand is derived demand, elasticity ↑  
>>> ○ Elasticity of capital supply ↑ → elasticity ↑

⑶ Supply of factors of production

> ① Supply of labor **:** the neoclassical interpretation from consumer theory (choice between labor and leisure) in the [Consumer Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1879) section  
>> ○ Assumption **:** workers can freely choose their working hours  
>> ○ Objective function **:** for utility function *u*, leisure *L*, and income/budget *M*  
>> ○ Constraint **:** for labor *H*, leisure *L*, and income/budget *M*  
>> ○ **Substitution effect** **:** wage rate ↑ → opportunity cost of leisure ↑ → leisure consumption ↓ → labor supply ↑  
>> ○ **Income effect** **:** wage rate ↑ → leisure consumption ↑ (leisure is a normal good) → labor supply ↓  
>> ○ Early on, the substitution effect dominates; later, the income effect dominates, producing a backward-bending (backward-bending) shape  
>> ○ In the backward-bending segment, the wage elasticity of labor supply is negative  
>> ○ (Note) If leisure is an inferior good, the backward-bending pattern does not appear  
>> ○ (Note) Non-labor income generates only the income effect → labor supply decreases

**Figure. 1.** Labor supply curve

> ② Supply of capital

> ③ Supply of land  
>> ○ The supply of land is perceived as almost fixed  
>> ○ The supply of land for a specific use can be elastic (e.g., land for housing)

⑷ Equilibrium in the factor market  

**Figure. 2.** Equilibrium in the factor market

> ① Determination of employment and wages  
>> ○ Employment and wages are determined by equilibrium between the product market (demand side) and the factor market (supply side)  
>> ○ (Note) As in the figure above, the backward-bending portion is sometimes omitted  
>> ○ Because the equilibrium price is directly linked to consumers’ income, this is also called income distribution theory  
>> ○ Reasons why the price of the same factor differs across markets

> ② When an imperfectly competitive market becomes a perfectly competitive market  
>> ○ Equilibrium employment and the equilibrium wage increase

> ③ Economic rent and transfer earnings

**Figure. 3.** The concept of transfer earnings and rent

>> ○ Transfer earning **:** the opportunity cost of the factor supplier  
>>> ○ The area below the supply curve  
>>> ○ (Comment) Similar to “cost”

>> ○ **Economic rent** **:** the extra payment made because a factor’s supply is inelastic  
>>> ○ Also called unearned income **:** corresponds to **producer surplus** in the goods market  
>>> ○ In other words, the portion of a payment that exceeds transfer earnings is called economic rent  
>>> ○ The more inelastic labor supply is, the larger the share of economic rent in total compensation  
>>> ○ **Example 1.** Famous entertainers, athletes  
>>> ○ **Example 2.** Activities where medical or bar associations restrict the number of new license holders  
>>> ○ **Example 3.** Lobbying to obtain government permits/authorizations  
>>> ○ (Comment) Similar to producer surplus

>> ○ Quasi-rent  
>>> ○ Compensation for factors whose supply is fixed in the short run, such as capital equipment  
>>> ○ That is, it has the nature of rent in the short run but the nature of transfer earnings in the long run

⑸ Monopsony and bilateral monopoly

> ① Monopsony  
>> ○ Definition **:** a market with many suppliers but only one buyer  
>>> ○ Hard to find in goods markets; mainly observed in factor markets  
>>> ○ Causes **:** extremely specialized factors, local/regional characteristics  
>> ○ Marginal factor cost curve (marginal factor cost curve) **:** the additional expenditure when purchasing the last unit of a factor  
>> ○ Condition **:** marginal factor cost = value of marginal product

**Figure. 4.** Monopsony vs. perfect competition

>>> ○ *Lc* **:** employment under perfect competition  
>>> ○ *wc* **:** factor price (wage) under perfect competition  
>>> ○ *Lm* **:** employment under monopsony  
>>> ○ *wm* **:** factor price (wage) under monopsony  
>>> ○ Compared with perfect competition, monopsony yields a lower factor price and a smaller employment level  
>>> ○ The difference between *wc* and *wm* is called monopsonistic exploitation

> ② Bilateral monopoly (bilateral monopoly; BM)

**Figure. 5.** Bilateral monopoly market

>>> ○ *Lc* **:** employment under perfect competition  
>>> ○ *wc* **:** factor price (wage) under perfect competition  
>>> ○ *LM* **:** employment under supply monopoly  
>>> ○ *wM* **:** factor price (wage) under supply monopoly  
>>> ○ *Lm* **:** employment under monopsony  
>>> ○ *wm* **:** factor price (wage) under monopsony  
>>> ○ In a bilateral monopoly, each side has monopoly power and their preferred outcomes conflict  
>>> ○ Ultimately, the outcome depends on which side has greater bargaining power

## **2. Labor market:** focusing on why wage differentials arise

⑴ When the labor market is perfectly competitive

> ① Productivity differences among workers  
> ② Differences in job amenities or risk **:** wage differentials here are called compensating wage differentials

⑵ When the labor market is imperfectly competitive

> ① Temporary disequilibrium in the market  
> ② Seniority-based pay  
> ③ Imperfect information  
> ④ Social discrimination

⑶ Skilled labor vs. unskilled labor

> ① The demand curve for skilled labor lies above that for unskilled labor (**∵** higher marginal productivity)  
> ② The supply curve for skilled labor lies above that for unskilled labor (**∵** higher cost of skill acquisition)  
> ③ Dual labor market theory  
>> ○ Primary labor market **:** managerial jobs, professional jobs, skilled craft jobs, etc.  
>> ○ Secondary labor market **:** simple laborers, domestic helpers, etc.  
>> ○ (Comment) Think of the primary market as the “first string” / better-positioned workers

⑷ Human capital theory **:** those who receive education have higher productivity than those who do not, so they will earn higher wages

⑸ Signaling theory **:** education is merely a device to distinguish capable from less capable people; raising education levels is **unrelated** to wage increases

⑹ Efficiency wage theory **:** a strategy of paying higher-than-industry wages so that workers exert maximum productivity

⑺ Labor unions

> ① Objectives of labor unions **:** increase wage income, improve working conditions, stabilize employment  
> ② Outcomes  
>> ○ It is difficult to achieve wage increases without sacrificing employment  
>> ○ Wages may fall in sectors where unions are not formed  
> ③ Factors that limit union power  
>> ○ Supply-side factors **:** for low-wage labor where non-union workers can easily supply labor, the relevant union’s power weakens  
>> ○ Demand-side factors **:** substituting labor with machines, reducing output to cut staff, weak product demand

⑻ Discrimination in the labor market **:** racial discrimination, gender discrimination, etc.

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Discrimination restricts women’s employment in the high-skill labor market  
> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. With reduced supply in the high-skill market, women’s wages rise  
> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. With increased supply in the ordinary-skill market, women’s wages fall  
> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. If this discrimination persists, it is used as “evidence” to justify discrimination and thereby intensifies it  
> ⑤ **Policy 1.** Principle of equal pay  
> ⑥ **Policy 2.** Principle of comparable worth  
> ⑦ **Policy 3.** Natural selection **:** discriminatory firms exclude highly productive people and are therefore selected out over time  
> ⑧ Why discrimination persists  
>> ○ Discriminated workers actually have lower productivity  
>> ○ Deep-rooted prejudice makes fair employment policies difficult to implement

## **3. Capital market**

⑴ Concept of capital

> ① Primary factors of production **:** labor and land can be used immediately without an additional production process  
> ② Produced factors of production **:** capital must be produced through a production process  
> ③ Capital goods **:** machines or equipment used in production  
>> ○ Depreciation **:** as capital goods are used, their value declines  
> ④ Capital services **:** services obtained by using capital goods for a period of time  
>> ○ The supply curve of capital services is upward sloping

⑵ The investment decision process

> ① Present value **:** the value of future revenues or costs evaluated in today’s terms  
> ② Discount rate **:** the rate used to discount future amounts into present value  
> ③ If present value ＞ investment cost **:** invest  
> ④ If present value ＜ investment cost **:** do not invest

⑶ Determination of the interest rate

> ① Why there are multiple interest rates in reality  
>> ○ Risk  
>> ○ Lending period  
>> ○ Administrative costs  
>> ○ Tax treatment
