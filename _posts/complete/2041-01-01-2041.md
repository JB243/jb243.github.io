**1\. Overview**

 ⑴ Market failure **:** a situation where problems arise in the **efficiency** of resource allocation and/or the **equity** of resource distribution  
([Efficiency](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044) and [Equity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044))

**2\. Cause 1.** [Imperfect competition](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1904)

**3\. Cause 2.** Public goods

 ⑴ Excludability **:** the property that people can be prevented from consuming a good

> ① If a good is **non-excludable**, people cannot be excluded from consuming it, so it is impossible to charge a fee.

> ② (Note) Excludability seems related to whether anyone can consume it.

 ⑵ Rivalry **:** the property that one person’s consumption restricts another person’s consumption

> ① If a good is **rival**, the resources used to produce it are used up with consumption, so the marginal cost of production and the marginal cost of consumption are the same.

> ② Even if a good is **non-rival** in consumption, there exists a marginal cost of allowing consumption of one unit of that good.

> ③ (Note) Rivalry seems related to whether it can be consumed simultaneously.

 ⑶ Private goods **:** goods that have both excludability and rivalry

> ① Examples **:** ice cream, clothes

 ⑷ Public goods **:** goods that have neither excludability nor rivalry

> ① Generally related to **positive externalities**

> ② The economy-wide demand function for a public good is the **vertical sum** of individual demand functions.

> ③ Unlike demand for private goods, an individual’s demand for a public good is called **virtual demand** or **pseudo-demand**.

> ④ Examples **:** typhoon warnings, national defense, neighborhood parks

> ⑤ **The free-rider problem** **:** a problem caused by non-excludability

>> ○ Thinking they can enjoy the benefit without paying, the market will not produce enough if left alone.

>> ○ The government addresses the shortage of public goods by collecting taxes and producing public goods.

>> ○ (Note) Common resources are also non-excludable, but common resources are usually not “produced,” so they are not typically the target of the free-rider problem.

 ⑸ Common resources **:** goods that are non-excludable but rival

> ① Generally related to **negative externalities**

> ② Example **:** the environment

> ③ **The tragedy of the commons** (the tragedy of the commons) **:** **the overuse problem**

>> ○ Because everyone can use a common resource, no one tries to conserve it, so it soon becomes depleted.

>> ○ (Note) Everyone can use it → non-excludability. It must be conserved → rivalry.

>> ○ Granting property rights to the commons can solve the tragedy of the commons (**Coase theorem**) (see below).

 ⑹ Artificially scarce goods **:** goods that are excludable but non-rival

**Figure 1.** Artificially scarce goods]

> ① Supply is intentionally reduced to maintain a high price.

> ② The average cost curve declines: similar to a natural monopoly.

> ③ Examples **:** password-protected WiFi, pay-per-view cable TV

 ⑺ Club goods (club goods, artificially scarce goods)

> ① Definition **:** goods that are non-rival up to a certain level, but become rival beyond that point

> ② Example **:** toll expressways

**4\. Cause 3.** Externalities (externality)

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition **:** a phenomenon where one person’s action affects the economic welfare of a third party, and no compensation is made for it

> ② Negative externality **:** an externality that lowers a third party’s economic welfare

>> ○ **Case 1. Change in cost curves** **:** contrast between the private marginal cost curve (PMC) and the social marginal cost curve (SMC) (typical)

**Figure 2.** Negative externality in the aluminum market

>> ○ **Case 2. Change in demand curves** **:** contrast between the private marginal benefit/value curve (PMB) and the social marginal benefit/value curve (SMB)

>> ○ Conclusion **:** overproduction; a price lower than the socially optimal level

>> ○ Also called an external diseconomy of consumption

> ③ Positive externality **:** an externality that benefits a third party

>> ○ **Case 1. Change in cost curves** **:** contrast between PMC and SMC

>> ○ **Case 2. Change in demand curves** **:** contrast between PMB and SMB (typical)

>> ○ Conclusion **:** underproduction; a price higher than the socially optimal level

>> ○ Also called an external economy of consumption

> ④ Conditions for an externality

>> ○ It must be unintended.

>> ○ It must not pass through the market price mechanism.

 ⑵ Public policies for externalities

> ① Direct regulation (command-and-control; CAC) **:** command-and-control policy

>> ○ Advantage **:** the regulatory effect can be directly ensured

>> ○ **Disadvantage 1.** The exact degree of regulation cannot be determined; i.e., it may impose unnecessary burdens on firms and reduce consumer benefits.

>> ○ **Disadvantage 2.** Due to inefficiencies such as administrative audit costs, the **cost** becomes very large.

>> ○ **Example 1. Environmental standards** **:** setting the maximum allowable emission level of pollutants

>>> ○ Environmental standards require all factories to reduce emissions below a certain number.

>> ○ **Example 2.** Mandating the use of purification equipment to reduce emissions

>> ○ **Example 3.** Requiring adoption of production technology with lower pollutant emissions

> ② Indirect regulation **:** market-based policies

>> ○ Internalizing an externality **:** a process of changing incentives so that people take into account the externalities they cause in decision-making

>> ○ A feature is that all firms have the same marginal benefit level.

>> ○ Advantage **:** efficiency is high because regulated parties make rational choices

>> ○ Disadvantage **:** the effect cannot be directly ensured, and punishment is weak

>> ○ **Example 1. Corrective taxes** **:** taxes designed to reduce external costs; also called a Pigouvian tax

>> ○ **Example 2. Pigouvian subsidies** **:** compensation designed to encourage actions that generate external benefits

>> ○ **Example 3. Tradable emissions permits** **:** licenses that allow pollutant emissions; permits can be traded among polluters

 ⑶ Coase theorem (Coase theorem)

> ① The principle that inefficiency caused by externalities can be resolved by the market itself

>> ○ That is, internalizing negative externalities through the assignment of property rights

> ② Assumptions

>> ○ Private economic agents can negotiate without incurring any costs in the resource allocation process.

>> ○ Property rights are clearly defined, regardless of who holds them.

>> ○ (Note) If all stakeholders negotiate, all interests are considered, so externalities are believed to be taken into account.

> ③ **Case 1.** When the firm has the right to the river

>> ○ The firm **increases** pollution emissions up to the point where it can compensate for damages caused by the river.

> ④ **Case 2.** When the victims have the right to the river

>> ○ If damages are large, victims pay the firm subsidies not to emit, thereby **reducing** pollution emissions.

> ⑤ Limitations

>> ○ Existence of transaction costs

>> ○ Negotiations may easily break down due to imperfect information.

>> ○ If there are many negotiating parties, it is difficult to achieve an efficient bargaining outcome.

 ⑷ Network externality (network externality)

> ① When the value of a good to an individual becomes greater as many other people also use that good

> ② Examples **:** communication methods, railway networks, hub-and-spoke airline networks, SNS
