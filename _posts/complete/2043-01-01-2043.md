## **1. Inflation**

### ⑴ Inflation *(inflation)*

> ① **Definition:** A phenomenon in which the price level rises continuously over multiple periods, causing the value of money to fall (↔ deflation)

> ② **Effects of inflation**
>
>> ○ **Efficiency harms:** Overinvestment in real assets; disruption of long-term lending/borrowing contracts  
>> ○ **Equity harms:** Transfers wealth from creditors holding monetary assets to debtors with monetary liabilities  
>> ○ Sometimes, it also transfers wealth from the private sector holding cash and government bonds to the government that issues them

> ③ **Inflation rate**

> ④ **Expected inflation rate:** Reflects economic agents’ expectations about changes in the price level

> ⑤ **Type 1. Demand-pull inflation**
>
>> ○ **Price increases driven by higher aggregate demand:** National income and prices rise simultaneously  
>> ○ **Keynesian school:** ΔG ↑ → IS shifts right → AD shifts right  
>>> ○ Continuous increases in government spending are impossible  
>>> ○ If inflation is excessive, they argue that contractionary policy should be implemented to restrain aggregate demand  
>> ○ **Monetarist school:** M ↑ → LM shifts right → AD shifts right  
>>> ○ Unlike government spending, the money supply can be expanded without bound

> ⑥ **Type 2. Cost-push inflation**
>
>> ○ **Price increases driven by a fall in aggregate supply:** National income falls while prices rise, producing stagflation *(stagflation)*

> ⑦ **Type 2-1. Wage-push inflation:** When workers demand wage increases that exceed the growth rate of labor productivity

> ⑧ **Type 2-2. Supply-shock inflation:** Arises from oil-price hikes, raw material price increases, etc.

> ⑨ **Type 3. Mixed inflation**
>
>> ○ Prices rise sharply

### ⑵ Social costs of inflation

> ① **Redistribution of wealth**
>
>> ○ Inflation shifts wealth from monetary assets to real assets  
>> ○ Real interest rates and real wages fall, harming creditors and workers  
>> ○ Fixed-income earners are harmed because nominal income is unchanged while real income falls  
>> ○ In general, the government may intentionally use inflation to obtain tax revenue from the private sector

> ② **Higher tax burdens under a progressive tax system**
>
>> ○ Because nominal income rises, the tax burden increases

> ③ **Shoe-leather costs**
>
>> ○ Transaction costs of exchanging/holding money rise

> ④ **Menu costs**
>
>> ○ If menu costs are excessive, firms cannot adjust prices immediately  
>> ○ Relative prices change, causing inefficiencies in market resource allocation

> ⑤ **Reduced economic growth**
>
>> ○ People prefer real assets, reducing financial savings: real estate is favored while deposits and stocks are avoided  
>> ○ In the long run, this can hinder growth by reducing funds available for investment

> ⑥ **Balance of payments**
>
>> ○ If prices of domestically produced goods rise, international competitiveness falls, exports decline, and imports rise: deterioration in the balance of payments

> ⑦ **Greater economic uncertainty**

### ⑶ (Reference) Hyperinflation *(hyperinflation)*

> ① **Definition:** When the inflation rate reaches thousands or tens of thousands of percent  
> ② Historically, this occurred in Germany after its defeat in World War I  
> ③ **Cause:** Because the government tries to obtain tax revenue by printing money  
>> ○ Money issuance → prices rise → more money issuance due to higher prices → prices rise further → ···

### ⑷ (Reference) Deflation

> ① **Definition:** A phenomenon in which the aggregate demand curve shifts left, leading to lower prices and lower national income  
> ② **Causes**
>
>> ○ Japan’s deflation in the 1990s and the Great Depression in the 1930s were caused by collapses in asset prices
>
> ③ **Effects**
>
>> ○ Falling prices increase the real burden of debt, reducing households’ disposable income  
>> ○ Lower disposable income reduces consumption and weakens financial institutions  
>> ○ As deflation pushes nominal interest rates toward 0, the economy can fall into a [liquidity trap](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2026)  
**:** Refer to the **Fisher equation** below

### ⑸ (Reference) Goldilocks *(goldilocks)*

> ① **Definition:** A state in which the economy achieves high growth without rising prices  
> ② Named after the British folktale “Goldilocks and the Three Bears”

---

## **2. The Dynamic Aggregate Demand–Aggregate Supply Model**

### ⑴ Overview

> ① Explains short-run fluctuations of dynamic economic variables  
> ② That is, variables are expressed in terms of rates of change

### ⑵ The dynamic aggregate demand curve *(Note: endogenous variables are now distinguished as nominal and real interest rates)*

> ① Fisher equation *(Fisher equation)*
>
>> ○ **Nominal interest rate (Rt):** Interest rate measured in monetary units  
>> ○ **Real interest rate (rt):** Interest rate expressed in real goods  
>> ○ Ex post real interest rate  
>> ○ Ex ante real interest rate  
>> ○ (Reference) **Darby effect:** Even if expected inflation is fully reflected in the nominal interest rate, creditors may still lose once the tax system is considered

> ② Nominal interest rate vs. real interest rate
>
>> ○ **Nominal interest rate:** Determines **money demand**. (Reference) An increase in money demand reduces real money supply  
>> ○ **Real interest rate:** Determines **investment demand**, because investment in construction, equipment, inventories, etc. is real investment

> ③ Dynamic aggregate demand curve  
>
**Figure. 1.** Dynamic aggregate demand curve]
>
>> ○ **Movement along the curve:** A fall in inflation (π0 → π1) increases real money supply, shifting the LM curve right  
>>> ○ **Increase in real money supply:** (Note) This likely means that money is not being used up by rising prices, indirectly increasing effective money supply  
>> ○ **Shift of the curve:** A rise in expected inflation → lower real interest rate → higher investment → AD shifts right (**Mundell–Tobin effect**)  
>>> ○ In the real interest rate–income diagram, LM shifts right: real interest rate falls, income rises  
>>> ○ In the nominal interest rate–income diagram, IS shifts right: nominal interest rate rises, income rises  
>>> ○ | rise in nominal interest rate | + | fall in real interest rate | = rise in expected inflation

### ⑶ The dynamic aggregate supply curve

> ① **Labor supply:** If expected inflation rises, labor supply decreases (**∵** expected decline in real wages) (i.e., expectation-related)  
> ② **Labor demand:** If inflation rises, labor demand increases (**∵** real wages fall) (i.e., actual-outcome-related)  
> ③ Dynamic aggregate supply curve  
>
**Figure. 2.** Dynamic aggregate supply curve]
>
>> ○ **Movement along the curve:** Inflation rises (π0 → π1) → real wages fall → labor demand increases  
>> ○ **Shift of the curve:** Expected inflation rises → nominal wage growth costs rise → labor supply falls → AS shifts left  
>>> ○ **Nominal wage growth cost:** W' - πe (i.e., workers believe they lose by πe)  
>>> ○ An increase in nominal wage growth cost is equivalent to a fall in the expected real wage

> ④ Okun’s law *(Okun's law)*
>
>> ○ Employment growth and the unemployment rate are inversely related: empirically, a 1% increase in the unemployment gap reduces output by 2.5%  
>> ○ un: the natural rate of unemployment. The long-run equilibrium unemployment rate corresponding to full-employment output

> ⑤ **Conclusion:** Derivation of the Phillips curve

### ⑷ Equilibrium in dynamic aggregate demand and supply *(Assume there is an unanticipated increase in the money growth rate)*

**Figure. 3.** Equilibrium in dynamic AD and AS]
>
> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Initially, the economy is in long-run equilibrium with output at the full-employment level  
> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. An unanticipated increase in money growth reduces money demand: LM shifts right; IS unchanged  
>
>> ○ Because private expected inflation (π0e) is fixed in the short run, IS does not move
>
> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Given expected inflation (π0e), AD shifts right  
> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Liquidity effect of monetary/financial policy *(liquidity effect)*: nominal interest rate falls, real interest rate falls, output rises  
>
>> ○ Real interest rate falls because it equals nominal interest rate minus expected inflation (fixed), so it moves with the nominal rate
>
> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. As equilibrium inflation rises, real money supply falls, so LM shifts **slightly** left  
> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. In the long run, expected inflation is revised upward to match actual inflation  
> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup>. Higher expected inflation lowers the real interest rate, shifting AD right  
> ⑧ 8<sup>th</sup>. Higher expected inflation increases nominal wage growth, shifting AS left  
> ⑨ 9<sup>th</sup>. As output returns to full employment, real money supply falls and LM shifts left  
> ⑩ 10<sup>th</sup>. In the long run, an increase in the money supply does not affect output or the real interest rate  
>
>> ○ Because the dynamic AD–AS model is based on classical assumptions, output equals potential output in the long run  
>> ○ From Y = C + I + G and Y = Y*, we can see that I is constant, implying the real interest rate returns to its initial level  
>> ○ The nominal interest rate rises by the amount of inflation  
>> ○ This is called the **expected inflation effect** *(expected inflation effect)* or the **Fisher effect** *(Fisher effect)*

---

## **3. The Phillips Curve** *(Phillips curve)*

### ⑴ The Phillips curve under static expectations *(also called the classical Phillips curve)*

> ① Reinterprets the positive relationship between output and inflation as an inverse relationship (trade-off) between unemployment and inflation  
>
**Figure. 4.** Classical Phillips curve
>
> ② **Policy implication:** Price stability and full employment cannot be achieved simultaneously  
> ③ **Limitation 1.** The classical Phillips curve focuses on nominal wages, but workers and firms actually focus on real wages  
>
>> ○ Lipsey studied the relationship between nominal wage growth and unemployment  
>> ○ Nominal wage increases → (money illusion) labor supply increases → real wages fall → labor demand increases and unemployment falls  
>> ○ It assumes excess demand (supply) in the labor market raises (lowers) nominal wages
>
> ④ **Limitation 2.** Stagflation in the 1970s: inflation and unemployment rose together, so the Y–π curve had a negative slope  
>
>> ○ In other words, stagflation demonstrated the instability of the Phillips curve

### ⑵ Adaptive expectations and the Phillips curve *(also called the natural rate of unemployment hypothesis; proposed in 1970)*

**Figure. 5.** Phillips curve under adaptive expectations]
>
> ① Overview
>
>> ○ Friedman and Phelps: unlike Lipsey, they argued that labor supply is determined not by nominal wage growth but by expected real wage growth  
>>> ○ Friedman was among the first to emphasize the role of expectations  
>> ○ This led to the concept of expected inflation  
>> ○ It became possible to explain stagflation  
>>> ○ The classical Phillips curve mainly explains the inflation–unemployment relationship driven by aggregate demand fluctuations  
>>> ○ Stagflation was caused by aggregate supply shocks, interpreted as an upward shift of the Phillips curve  
>>> ○ Inflation in the 1970s was largely cost-push inflation driven by supply shocks
>
> ② Phillips curve
>
>> ○ πe: expected future inflation under adaptive expectations  
>> ○ Past observed outcomes are incorporated into expectations: persistent errors occur when inflation keeps rising  
>> ○ un: natural rate of unemployment  
>> ○ **Short run:** downward-sloping Phillips curve  
>> ○ **Long run:** vertical Phillips curve
>
> ③ Interpretation under adaptive expectations
>
>> ○ Under adaptive expectations, if the central bank raises the inflation rate, an effect appears in the short run **even if only briefly**  
>> ○ **Short run:** downward-sloping Phillips curve; a choice can be made between inflation and unemployment (**∵** money illusion)  
>> ○ **Long run:** workers’ expected inflation matches actual inflation, and unemployment returns to the natural rate
>
> ④ Natural rate hypothesis *(natural rate hypothesis)*: proposed by the Keynesian school
>
>> ○ **Definition**  
>>> ○ The long-run Phillips curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment  
>>> ○ The natural rate can be used as a benchmark indicator for monetary/financial policy  
>>> ○ It can be used to assess whether policy stance is consistent with resolving labor-market imbalances  
>> ○ NAIRU *(non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment)*: the unemployment rate at which inflation can remain stable without accelerating or decelerating  
>> ○ **Case 1.** Unemployment < natural rate: inflation accelerates  
>> ○ **Case 2.** Unemployment > natural rate: disinflation accelerates
>
> ⑤ Limitations of the natural rate hypothesis: why monetary policy should not be decided by relying solely on the Phillips curve
>
>> ○ **Limitation 1.** The natural rate is difficult to estimate (a technical problem)  
>> ○ **Limitation 2.** Effects of monetary policy appear with a lag of 2–3 years, creating uncertainty  
>>> ○ That is, economic conditions can change over 2–3 years  
>> ○ **Limitation 3.** Assumes adaptive expectations: with rational expectations, policy ineffectiveness can arise  
>>> ○ This is why many economists are skeptical about immediate policy responses

### ⑶ Rational expectations and the Phillips curve *(proposed by Lucas of the New Classical school)*

> ① Interpretation under rational expectations  
>
>> ○ Agents use not only past and current realized inflation but also all information such as policy stance of the government/central bank and the economic environment  
>> ○ Under rational expectations, monetary policy is effective only if the central bank implements **unanticipated** policy
>
> ② Unanticipated policy
>
>> ○ A sudden increase in inflation and nominal wage growth is mistaken for a rise in real wages, increasing labor supply  
>> ○ **Effect:** real wages fall, unemployment falls  
>> ○ **Case 1.** Unanticipated expansionary monetary policy: move along the Phillips curve  
>> ○ **Case 2.** If the private sector does not trust the central bank: move along the Phillips curve
>
> ③ Anticipated policy
>
>> ○ Nominal wages have already risen by expected inflation, so real wages are unchanged  
>> ○ **Effect:** no impact on unemployment; only inflation rises  
>> ○ **Case 1.** Anticipated expansionary monetary policy: immediate upward shift  
>> ○ **Case 2.** If the private sector trusts the central bank: immediate upward/downward shift  
>> ○ In countries with high average inflation, monetary policy tends to produce only small output gains

---

## **4. Monetary and Financial Policy**

### ⑴ The central bank’s policy game *(policy game)*

> ① Social welfare function
>
>> ○ If total output (Y) exceeds full-employment output (Y*), unemployment falls and social welfare rises  
>> ○ If inflation (π) rises, social welfare falls  
>> ○ α is the relative weight on the harm from inflation
>
> ② The central bank’s policy objectives: price stability and employment stability  
> ③ **Case 1.** Always keep inflation at 0 to anchor private inflation expectations at 0  
> ④ **Case 2.** If a price-stability stance is established and expected inflation is 0  
> ⑤ **Case 3.** If the private sector rationally anticipates the central bank’s revised optimal policy (π = γ/α): social welfare declines

### ⑵ Policy credibility and rules

> ① Discretion *(discretion)*
>
>> ○ **Definition:** Monetary/financial policy changes frequently at the central bank’s discretion  
>> ○ It fails to be effective and only generates inflation bias  
>> ○ Inflation bias: the private sector does not fully trust promised inflation and holds a systematic bias  
>> ○ Dynamic inconsistency of optimal policy *(dynamic inconsistency of optimal policy)*  
>>> ○ **Definition:** The policy authority has an incentive to break implicit market trust and pursue short-run goals  
>>> ○ That is, policy deviates from prior announcements over time, reducing consistency
>
> ② Rule *(rule)*
>
>> ○ If policy is kept consistent and credibility is obtained, the best outcome can be achieved  
>> ○ Example: Friedman’s k% rule

### ⑶ Setting goals for monetary policy

> ① Background
>
>> ○ Because monetary policy is slow and variable in effect, intermediate targets are needed  
>> ○ Money supply and interest rates are easier to monitor than inflation and unemployment
>
> ② Targeting money supply
>
>> ○ **Advantages**  
>>> ○ If the money-demand function is stably related to nominal income, growth can be adjusted easily via money supply  
>>> ○ The money supply—especially the monetary base—can be controlled relatively easily  
>> ○ **Disadvantages**  
>>> ○ The appropriate target range is unclear  
>>> ○ Instability of money demand and endogeneity of money supply make target achievement difficult  
>>> ○ In general, it takes considerable time to compile broad monetary aggregates
>
> ③ Targeting interest rates
>
>> ○ **Advantages**  
>>> ○ Compared with money supply, the central bank can control interest rates relatively easily via open market operations  
>>> ○ The real interest rate has large spillover effects on the real sector  
>>> ○ The central bank’s decision on the short-term interest rate itself can act as a signal affecting investors’ expectations  
>> ○ **Disadvantages**  
>>> ○ Investment is influenced by the long-term real interest rate, but the central bank controls only the short-term nominal rate in practice  
>>> ○ If there is no stable relationship between short-term nominal and long-term real rates, it is not a valid target
>
> ④ In addition to price stability and employment stability, reducing inequality is also emerging as a monetary-policy objective

### ⑷ Monetary policy operating frameworks

> ① Inflation targeting
>
>> ○ Unifying the objective of monetary policy into price stability  
>> ○ Views differ as to why it succeeded: some argue prices truly stabilized; others argue China’s entry into global markets lowered costs and stabilized prices  
>> ○ **Criticism 1.** After the global financial crisis, employment stability became a major issue  
>> ○ Inflation targeting underestimated financial markets and fostered conditions for the global financial crisis  
>> ○ **Criticism 2.** Inflation targeting was originally developed in high-inflation environments and failed to create effective demand during the Great Recession
>
> ② Price-level targeting
>
> ③ Taylor rule *(Taylor rule)*
>
>> ○ Target nominal policy rate = equilibrium nominal policy rate + α × output gap + β × inflation gap  
>> ○ Equilibrium nominal policy rate = inflation rate + equilibrium real policy rate  
>> ○ α > 0: responsiveness of the target policy rate to the output gap  
>> ○ β > 0: responsiveness of the target policy rate to the inflation gap
>
> ④ Gradualism strategy for reducing inflation *(gradualism strategy)*
>
>> ○ The authority gradually lowers money growth to reduce inflation
>
> ⑤ Cold turkey strategy for reducing inflation *(cold turkey strategy)*
>
>> ○ The authority sharply lowers money growth all at once  
>> ○ **Advantage:** Signals strong commitment and can build credibility  
>> ○ **Disadvantage:** If credibility is not secured or prices are sticky, excessive unemployment can cause large welfare losses

### ⑸ Applications

> ① Ricardian equivalence theorem *(Ricardian equivalence theorem)*
>
>> ○ **Definition:** With government spending fixed, a tax cut financed by issuing government bonds has no effect on real variables  
>> ○ (Note) There is no gain without sacrifice  
>> ○ When Ricardian equivalence does not hold: if higher future taxes are expected to finance accumulated government debt, consumers may reduce consumption or increase saving, offsetting the effect of fiscal expansion
>
> ② Debt deflation *(deflation)*
>
>> ○ A chain process in which prices keep falling and national income declines at the same time
