**1.** Efficiency

**2.** Equity

**1\. Efficiency** (efficiency)

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition **:** Achieving the maximum effect with the minimum cost

> ② In other words, the economic resources that exist within an economy are not wasted at all and are utilized in the best possible way

> ③ The evaluation criterion for efficiency is Pareto efficiency

 ⑵ Feasible allocation (feasible allocation)

> ① Definition **:** An allocation that does not exceed the endowment of resources in the economy

> ② (Allocation of good X to A) + (allocation of good X to B) ≤ (total amount of good X in the economy)

 ⑶ **Pareto efficiency** **:** Also called Pareto optimality

> ① Definition **:** A state in which it is impossible to move to a new allocation without decreasing anyone’s utility level

>> ○ That is, the most efficient state of resource allocation

>> ○ Reason **:** Because all opportunities are being exploited

>> ○ Here, “utility” means ordinal utility **:** it is assumed that the utilities of different people cannot be compared

> ② Pareto improvement **:** A change that benefits at least one person without harming anyone

> ③ **Type 1.** Pareto efficiency in exchange

>> ○ Definition **:** Within the given quantities of goods, allocating them well so as to maximize the utilities of two people

>> ○ Edgeworth box (Edward box) **:** also called an Edgeworth box

**Figure. 1.** Edgeworth box]

>>> ○ Every point inside the Edgeworth box employs (uses) all given economic resources

**Figure. 2.** Contract curve]

>>> ○ Contract curve (contract curve) **:** the curve connecting Pareto-efficient allocation points

>>> ○ In general, indifference curves are assumed to be convex to the origin

>>> ○ A point on the contract curve such as point G is a tangency point of a common tangent line to iA and iB

> ④ **Type 2.** Pareto efficiency in production

>> ○ Definition **:** Using the given factors of production well to produce as much output as possible

>> ○ As in Pareto efficiency in exchange, an Edgeworth box can be drawn

>> ○ (Reference) [Production possibility curve](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1893) (production possibility
curve; PPC)

>>> ○ By mapping (moving) points on the contract curve, one can obtain the production possibility curve

>>> ○ Overview

>>>> ○ Simple definition **:** A curve showing combinations of goods that can be produced to the maximum in an economy

>>>> ○ Precise definition **:** A graph showing combinations of two goods that can be produced under full employment in a society

>>>> ○ Drawn in the first quadrant

>>> ○ Points farther from the origin than the PPC **:** impossible

>>> ○ Points closer to the origin than the PPC **:** inefficient

>>> ○ Law of increasing opportunity cost (law of increasing opportunity cost)

>>>> ○ **Meaning 1.** In reality, the PPC is concave to the origin

>>>> ○ **Meaning 2.** As the output of one good increases, the opportunity cost of that good increases

>>>> ○ **Meaning 3.** The slope of the PPC increases (in absolute value)

>>>> ○ **Tip.** The slope of the PPC represents opportunity cost

>>>> ○ (Reference) If opportunity cost increases → concave to the origin; if constant → straight line; if decreasing → convex to the origin

>>>> ○ Fundamental reason **:** As production increases, less efficient factors are brought into production, so opportunity cost rises

> ⑤ **Type 3.** Overall (comprehensive) Pareto efficiency
([ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC2vlpCwL9A&list=PL11iCOlE6aYJl63i5WZnWQmiLjSx7i5ka&index=90))]

>> ○ For the economy-wide allocation of resources to be efficient, both consumption and production must achieve Pareto efficiency

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. For each point on the PPC, there is a corresponding Edgeworth box

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. For each Edgeworth box, one can draw a contract curve

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Along the contract curve inside each Edgeworth box, one can draw a utility-possibility curve

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. If all utility-possibility curves are gathered and smoothly connected (as an envelope), one can find the utility possibility frontier

>> ○ Utility possibility frontier (utility possibility frontier; UPF)

>>> ○ The boundary between efficient allocations and inefficient allocations

>>> ○ Every point on a utility-possibility curve satisfies Pareto efficiency in consumption

>>> ○ Because only one point on the contract curve satisfies MRS = MRT, only that point lies on the utility possibility frontier

> ⑥ Limitations of Pareto efficiency

>> ○ Using Pareto efficiency yields infinitely many solutions, so another criterion is needed to choose an “optimal” point

>> ○ It cannot judge equity

 ⑷ First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics

> ① Assumptions

>> ○ Every consumer’s preference system satisfies strong monotonicity

>> ○ No externalities exist in the economy

> ② Conclusion **:** In a competitive (general competition) market, a Pareto-efficient allocation of resources is achieved automatically

>> ○ A modern interpretation of Adam Smith’s “invisible hand”

> ③ Limits of the market

>> ○ The market does not guarantee equity in distribution

>> ○ Sometimes problems arise even in terms of efficiency of resource allocation **:** due to imperfect competition or the existence of externalities

 ⑸ Second Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics

> ① Assumptions

>> ○ Initial endowments are appropriately distributed

>> ○ Everyone’s preferences are continuous, strongly monotonic, and convex

> ② Conclusion **:** A Pareto-efficient allocation can be realized as a competitive general equilibrium

>> ○ This corresponds to the converse of the First Theorem

**2\. Equity** (equity)

 ⑴ Overview

> ① How equitably resources in the economy are distributed among members of society

> ② It is impossible to find an objective standard of equity

 ⑵ Measuring inequality

> ① Inequality index (inequality index) **:** based on the premise that equalization implies equality

>> ○ Income decile (income decile) **:** income groups consisting of people in 10% segments

>>> ○ Mean household income (mean household income) **:** the average income across all households

>>> ○ Median household income (median household income) **:** the household income of the median in the income distribution

>> ○ Deciles distribution ratio (deciles distribution ratio)

>>> ○ Definition **:** (income of the bottom 40%) divided by (income of the top 20%)

>>> ○ Ranges from 0 to 2; the smaller the value, the more unequal the distribution

>> ○ Quintile ratio

>>> ○ Definition **:** (income of the top 20%) divided by (income of the bottom 20%)

>>> ○ Takes values from 1 to ∞, like the deciles distribution ratio with numerator/denominator swapped

>> ○ Poverty rate

>>> ○ Poverty line (poverty line) **:** an income level below which a household is judged to be in absolute poverty

>>> ○ Poverty rate (poverty rate) **:** the proportion of households whose income is below the poverty line in the total population

>>> ○ The poverty line is also called the minimum cost of living

>>> ○ Methods for estimating the minimum cost of living **:** Rowntree, Leyden, or a fixed proportion of mean or median income

>>> ○ Poverty indices **:** the Sen index, etc.

>> ○ **Gini coefficient** (Gini coefficient)

>>> ○ Lorenz curve **:** a graph drawn by lining people up from poorest to richest and cumulatively plotting the share of total income

**Figure. 3.** Lorenz curve]

>>> ○ Let the crescent-shaped area be α, and let β be the area of the right triangle minus α; the Gini coefficient is defined as follows

>>> ○ It is 0 under complete equality and 1 under extreme inequality

>>> ○ [Another calculation method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) ([Python
code](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1892#:%C%9 %8))

>>>> ○ Formula 1

>>>> ○ Formula 2

>>> ○ (Distinct concept) [Gini coefficient in information theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2145#:1.-,Giniimpurity,-entropy)

>>>> ○ Formalization

>>>> ○ As the Gini coefficient moved from economics into machine learning and information theory, it came to suggest a similar “degree of inequality,” but its mathematical definition differs

>>>> ○ **Difference** **:** If the distribution of variables is all identical,

>>>>> ○ Gini coefficient in economics **:** becomes extremely equal, so it takes the value 0

>>>>> ○ Gini coefficient in information theory **:** by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality it takes its maximum value; intuitively, it is maximally disordered

>> ○ Atkinson index **:** a method to measure inequality of income distribution based on society’s welfare function

>> ○ Kuznets’ inverted-U hypothesis

> ② Problems **:** For the following reasons, it cannot fully represent inequality in living standards

>> ○ Welfare programs (see below)

>> ○ Life cycle of income (life cycle) **:** a characteristic pattern of income changes over a person’s lifetime

>> ○ Permanent income (permanent income) **:** a person’s normal income, which should be distinguished from transitory income

>> ○ Mobility between classes

 ⑶ Social welfare function (social welfare function; SWF) **:** a measure of equity

> ① Definition **:** A function that aggregates the preferences of members of society into a social preference

> ② Utilitarian values **:** the social welfare function is defined as the sum of individual utilities

> ③ Egalitarian values **:** lower weights for people with higher utility, higher weights for people with lower utility

> ④ Rawls (J. Rawls) **:** the utility of the member with the lowest utility level determines the welfare level of the society

> ⑤ Arrow (K. Arrow) **:** proved via the impossibility theorem that there is no rational criterion that can compare multiple social states

> ⑥ Theory of the second best **:** if not all efficiency conditions are satisfied, satisfying more of them does not necessarily increase social welfare

 ⑷ Political philosophies of income redistribution

> ① Egalitarianism (egalitarianism)

>> ○ Equality is interpreted as an equal right to a minimum standard of living

> ② Utilitarianism (utilitarianism)

>> ○ A political philosophy that the government should maximize the total utility of all members of society

>> ○ Assumption **:** everyone has the same utility function and marginal product diminishes

>> ○ Because marginal product diminishes, it argues that wealth should move from the rich to the poor

>> ○ (Note) It seems, fundamentally, to distrust the market’s invisible hand

> ③ Liberalism (liberalism)

>> ○ A political philosophy that the government should choose policies that a fair third party behind a “veil of ignorance” would choose

>> ○ Based on John Rawls’s contractarian theory of justice

>> ○ **Principle 1.** Maxi-min criterion (maxi-min criterion) **:** maximize the welfare of the poorest in society

>> ○ **Principle 2.** Social insurance (social insurance) **:** protect citizens from the risks of disasters

> ④ Libertarianism (libertarianism)

>> ○ A political philosophy that the government should only punish crime and enforce contracts, and should not redistribute income

>> ○ Libertarians consider equality of opportunity (procedural equality) more important than equality of outcomes

 ⑸ Welfare programs

> ① In-kind transfer (in-kind transfer) **:** assistance provided to the poor in the form of goods or services instead of cash

> ② Means-tested program (means-tested program) **:** provides benefits when an individual or household income is below a certain level

> ③ Progressive taxation

> ④ Negative income tax (negative income tax)

>> ○ A system in which the government pays subsidies to low-income households rather than taxing them

>> ○ Advantage **:** recipients can receive benefits without stigma

>> ○ Disadvantage **:** excessive cost; not a fundamental solution

> ⑤ Social security (social security) **:** provides income after retirement through payroll taxes

> ⑥ Unemployment insurance (unemployment insurance) **:** provides a portion of wages to workers who lost their jobs until they find a new one

> ⑦ Health insurance

>> ○ Individuals pay a fixed cost each year and are promised payment for most of the medical expenses they will need later

>> ○ If health insurance enrollment were completely voluntary, healthy people would not enroll, so premiums would rise

>> ○ Compared with private health insurance, employer-based health insurance is less voluntary, so premiums become lower

>> ○ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)

>>> ○ Also called PPACA (patient protection and affordable care act) or ACA

>>> ○ Focuses on supporting the uninsured and reducing healthcare costs

 ⑹ Limitations of welfare programs

> ① Cannot eradicate poverty at its root

> ② Overall decline in economic efficiency **:** reduced motivation of high-income earners, “welfare dependency” among low-income earners, etc.
