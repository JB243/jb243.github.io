⑴ Lucas critique (Lucas critique)

> ○ The marginal propensity to consume is not constant regardless of economic policy.

>> ○ Temporary tax cut (e.g., a one-time lottery win) **:** c = 0

>> ○ Permanent tax cut (e.g., winning the lottery every year) **:** c = 1

> ○ Not only the marginal propensity to consume, but also the coefficients of behavioral functions such as the consumption function and investment function can change with policy changes.

> ○ Because intuitive macroeconomic models have limitations, micro-founded macroeconomic models have emerged.

**2\. Microfoundations of the goods market**

⑴ Consumption (C, consumption)

> ① Hypotheses about income

>> ○ **Hypothesis 1. Absolute income hypothesis** **:** Keynes’s hypothesis that consumption is related only to the absolute level of current income.

>>> ○ Limitation **:** Even a temporary tax-rate cut changes current income, so it is viewed as having a large impact on changes in consumption.

>>> ○ Kuznets’s empirical analysis

>>>> ○ Cross-sectional analysis **:** As the income level rises, APC decreases.

>>>> ○ Short-run time-series analysis **:** In booms, APC is low; in recessions, APC is high.

>>>> ○ Long-run time-series analysis **:** In the long run, APC is constant.

>>>> ○ Keynes’s absolute income hypothesis cannot explain the long-run time-series analysis.

>> ○ **Hypothesis 2. Relative income hypothesis**

>>> ○ Irreversibility of consumption **:** The marginal propensity to consume differs between decreases and increases in consumption; a ratchet effect appears.

>>> ○ Relativity of consumption **:** Also called the demonstration effect.

>> ○ **Hypothesis 3. Permanent income hypothesis** (see below)

>> ○ **Hypothesis 4. Life-cycle hypothesis** (see below)

> ② Formalization **:** Assume there are only period 1 and period 2.

>> ○ Ci **:** consumer’s consumption in period i

>> ○ Yi **:** consumer’s income in period i

>> ○ Ti **:** lump-sum tax in period i

>> ○ S **:** saving in period 1 (S ＞ 0) or borrowing (S ＜ 0)

>> ○ a0 **:** initial assets

>> ○ r **:** real interest rate on financial and real assets

>> ○ U **:** a utility function with diminishing marginal utility; convexity with respect to the origin, i.e., preference for smoother consumption across periods

>> ○ PV (present value) **:** the present value of lifetime consumption and also the present value of lifetime wealth; a constant

>> ○ (Reference) Keynes viewed PV = Y1 − T1.

> ③ Generalization **:** Assume the substitution effect ＞ the income effect.

>> ○ Endowment point (endowment) **:** the point (C1, C2) = (a0 + Y1 − T1, Y2 − T2), which the budget line always passes through even when the interest rate changes

>> ○ **case 1.** An increase in the interest rate and a saver

>>> ○ Saver **:** a person who saves positively (S > 0); current consumption is lower than at the endowment point

>>> ○ Substitution effect **:** As the opportunity cost of current consumption rises, C1 decreases and C2 increases.

>>> ○ Income effect **:** As interest income rises, C1 and C2 increase (**∵** assuming current and future consumption are normal goods)

>>> ○ If we assume the substitution effect ＞ the income effect, then C1 decreases.

>> ○ **case 2.** An increase in the interest rate and a borrower

>>> ○ Borrower **:** a person who borrows (S < 0); current consumption is higher than at the endowment point

>>> ○ Substitution effect **:** As the opportunity cost of current consumption rises, C1 decreases and C2 increases.

>>> ○ Income effect **:** As interest costs rise, C1 and C2 decrease (**∵** assuming current and future consumption are normal goods)

>>> ○ If we assume the substitution effect ＞ the income effect, then C1 decreases.

>> ○ **case 3.** When current and future consumption are perfect complements **:** there is no substitution effect.

>> ○ **case 4.** An increase in current income **:** the increase in current income ＞ the increase in current consumption

>>> ○ To smooth consumption across periods, saving in the present increases.

>> ○ **case 5.** An increase in future income **:** the increase in future income ＞ the increase in future consumption

>>> ○ To smooth consumption across periods, borrowing in the present increases.

>> ○ **case 6.** Current income and future income increase at the same time **:** the marginal propensity to consume approaches 1.

⑵ Investment (I, investment)

> ① Formalization **:** Assume there are only period 1 and period 2.

>> ○ d **:** depreciation rate per unit of capital

>> ○ I **:** total investment in period 1

>> ○ Yi **:** output in period i

>> ○ Ki **:** capital stock at the beginning of period i (initial capital stock is given as K1)

>> ○ Li **:** labor input in period i

>> ○ zi **:** total factor productivity or technology level at the beginning of period i

>> ○ wi **:** wage in period i

>> ○ F **:** a function increasing in capital and labor inputs; exhibits diminishing marginal productivity

>> ○ (1-d) K2 **:** liquidation value of capital at the end of period 2; converted into consumption goods and sold in the goods market

> ② Generalization

>> ○ Meaning of equation (#) **:** A firm’s optimal investment is determined by equating the marginal revenue of investment (left-hand side) with the marginal cost (right-hand side).

>> ○ **case 1.** Real interest rate rises

>>> ○ Marginal cost of investment rises → investment demand falls → investment decreases

>> ○ **case 2.** Depreciation rate rises

>>> ○ Direct effect **:** marginal return to investment falls → investment decreases

>>> ○ Indirect effect **:** period-2 capital stock falls → marginal product of capital in period 2 rises → investment increases

>>> ○ Generally, the direct effect is larger than the indirect effect → investment decreases

>> ○ **case 3.** Total factor productivity rises

>>> ○ Marginal product of capital in period 2 rises → investment increases

⑶ Government spending (G)

> ① Formalization

>> ○ B **:** government bonds issued only in period 1

>> ○ Gi **:** government spending in period i

>> ○ Ti **:** tax revenue in period i

> ② Key differences once the government budget constraint is included

>> ○ **Difference 1.** The fiscal multiplier of government spending in the goods market changes (see below).

>> ○ **Difference 2.** An increase in government spending changes not only the real aggregate demand curve but also the real aggregate supply curve (see below).

⑷ Aggregate demand and the real interest rate

> ① Aggregate demand in the period-1 goods market

> ② Applications

>> ○ **case 1.** Real interest rate rises → C and I fall → Yd falls → **movement along** the IS curve (**movement of a point**)

>> ○ **case 2.** Government spending rises → total expenditure rises → Yd rises → **shift** of the IS curve (**the curve itself moves**)

>>> ○ A permanent increase in government spending

>>> ○ A temporary increase in government spending **:** Because consumers smooth consumption across periods, part of the increase in government spending is absorbed into future consumption, so

**3\. Microfoundations of the labor market**

⑴ Labor demand function

> ① Formalization **:** Assume there are only period 1 and period 2.

> ② Generalization

>> ○ **case 1.** Period-1 real wage (w1) rises → labor demand falls → labor demand curve slopes downward (**movement of a point**)

>> ○ **case 2.** Period-1 total factor productivity (z1) rises → period-1 marginal product of labor (MPL1) rises → labor demand falls (**shift of the curve**)

⑵ Labor supply function

> ① Formalization

>> ○ U **:** increasing function; diminishing marginal utility

>> ○ Ci **:** consumption in period i

>> ○ li **:** leisure in period i

>> ○ 1-li **:** labor supply in period i

>> ○ wi **:** real wage in period i

>> ○ Πi **:** firm’s profit in period i. Because **shareholders are also workers**, it must be considered.

> ② Generalization

>> ○ When government spending changes, lifetime wealth PV changes, so labor supply changes.

>> ○ Intuitive macroeconomic models do not consider the above mechanism.

⑶ Equilibrium in the labor market

**4. Equilibrium of aggregate demand and aggregate supply**

⑴ Formalization

**5\. Microfoundations of the money market**

⑴ Overview

> ① Since the micro-founded AD–AS model is an extension of the classical model, the money market cannot affect the real sector.

> ② There are transaction media such as money and credit cards **:** “credit cards” include banks.

> ③ Because the money market offers no return but credit cards involve fees, there is an equilibrium between the two transaction media.

⑵ The credit card services market

**Figure. 1.** Credit card services market]

> ① Marginal benefit of credit card services = P(1 + R) **:** principal and interest obtained at the bank’s nominal interest rate

> ② Marginal cost of credit card services = P(1 + q) **:** the transaction amount (P) and the credit card service fee

> ③ Equilibrium in the credit card services market

⑶ The money market

> ① Xs(q) **:** supply of credit card services

> ② Xd(q) **:** demand for credit card services

> ③ X* **:** equilibrium transaction volume of credit card services

> ④ Y - X* **:** quantity of money held by consumers, firms, and the government

> ⑤ Md **:** nominal money demand; a decreasing function of the nominal interest rate

> ⑥ Ms **:** nominal money supply

> ⑦ V **:** income velocity of money; an increasing function of the nominal interest rate

> ⑧ Unlike the above model, Keynes viewed transaction money demand simply as an increasing function of income.
