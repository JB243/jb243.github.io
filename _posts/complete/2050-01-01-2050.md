## **1. `QC 1.`** Experimental QC (Sample Level Quality Control)

⑴ Definition: Metric for assessing tissue quality

⑵ RNA-seq methodology

> ① **Step 1.** Purify RNA: DNAse treatment to remove genomic content

> ② **Step 2.** Enrich for mRNA using polyA selection 

> ③ **Step 3.** Fragment RNA to library insert size (200-400 nt)

> ④ **Step 4.** Convert RNA to cDNA 

> ⑤ **Step 5.** Prepare cDNA for sequencing (ligate adapters, amplify, add barcodes)

> ⑥ **Step 6.** Sequence one or both ends of fragments (usually 50, 100, or 150 nt per read)

> ⑦ **Step 7.** Map to genome 

⑶ **Type 1.** RIN (RNA Integrity Number)

> ① Background Knowledge: mRNA comprises less than 3% of total RNA. rRNA makes up more than 80% (mainly 28S [2 kb] and 18S [5 kb] in eukaryotic cells).

> ② Measured by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

> ③ RIN Algorithm: It uses features such as the ratio of 18S to total RNA, the ratio of 28S to total RNA, and the 18S normalized height.

> ④ RIN = 10: Intact RNA.

> ⑤ RIN = 1: Completely degraded RNA.

> ⑥ RIN > 7: Generally considered suitable quality level for RNA-seq.

⑷ **Type 2.** DV200: Percentage of fragments around 200 nt in FFPE tissues, indicating RNA fragmentation

⑸ **Type 3.** Nucleic Acid Purity Quantification via Absorbance Ratio

> ① 260 nm / 280 nm Ratio

>> ○ Pure DNA: ~1.8

>> ○ Pure RNA: ~2.0

>> ○ A low 260 nm / 280 nm ratio suggests the presence of proteins or phenol, which absorb at 280 nm.

> ② 260 nm / 230 nm Ratio

>> ○ Pure DNA/RNA molecules: ~2-2.2

>> ○ A low 260 nm / 230 nm ratio indicates the presence of other contaminants.

⑹ **Type 4.** Nucleic Acid Weight Quantification

> ① Extract RNA using miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) or similar methods.

> ② RNA weight criterion: At least 250 ng.

⑺ **Type 5.** RNA Quality Score (RQS)

⑻ **Type 6.** ChIP-Seq Experimental QC

> ① ChIP grade monoclonal antibody: Pre-tested with ChIP-seq. 20-30% of the commercially produced antibodies tested were unsatisfactory for ChIP-seq.

> ② qPCR: Best to test positive control region(s) using the ChIP sample. Hope to detect >10-12x fold enrichment over IgG (non-specific antibody).

> ③ Biotinylated transcription factor: Permits factor pull-down on streptavidin. Independent of antibodies.

> ④ CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag, and ChIP-exo are methods to improve the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of peaks in ChIP-seq.

## **2. `QC 2.`** Data QC (Sequence Level Quality Control)

⑴ Definition: Metric for assessing data quality

⑵ **Type 1:** QC metrics for the data itself: Used for external validity confirmation by manual inspection or comparing with other datasets

> ① QC metrics

>> ○ [dUTP method](https://jb243.github.io/pages/75#:~:text=%E2%91%A9%20%EC%9D%91%EC%9A%A9%201.-,dUTP%20method,-%3A%20strand%2Dspecific): "_1.fastq" represents first strand (anti-sense), "_2.fastq" represents second strand (sense; original RNA sequence)

>> ○ **base quality**

>> ○ **mapping rate**

>>> ○ mappability filter 

>>>> ○ **Type 1.** uniqueness: How unique each sequence is starting at a particualr base and of a particular length

>>>> ○ **Type 2.** alignability: How uniquely k-mer sequences align to a region of the genome (up to 2 mismatches allowed)

>>> ○ mappability score : S = 1 / # of matches found in genome 

>>> ○ Long reads can resolve mapping issue among highly similar regions: Some regions of the genome are troublesome regardless of read length.

>> ○ **Non-coding RNA ratio**

>>> ○ High non-coding RNA ratio and high duplication indicate poor RNA quality

>> ○ **GC content**

>>> ○ High GC content: Suggests potential rRNA contamination; requires filtering of 5S, 18S, 28S rRNA

>>> ○ Low GC content: Indicates potential issues with reverse transcription

>>> ○ Related to CpG island.

>> ○ **Read duplicate**

>>> ○ PCR duplicate: A duplicate that is merely a replication of the same nucleic acid molecule during PCR.

>>> ○ If the sequences are exactly the same, they are considered PCR duplicates. If they are similar, they are considered biological duplicates.

>>> ○ In paired-end experiments, duplicates occur at the paired-end level.

>>> ○ Generally, DNA-seq involves removing duplicates, while RNA-seq does not: In RNA-seq, the same sequence may repeatedly appear not only due to technical duplicates but also due to high expressing transcripts or short genes. Removing these biological duplicates can reduce the dynamic range of the data or decrease statistical power.

>>> ○ The likelihood of increased duplication rate may rise with the number of cycles during the PCR process: By checking the correlation between the duplicate rate and the number of PCR cycles, one can distinguish between technical and biological duplicates.

>>> ○ Tools for removing duplicates: Samtools, Picard, Trimmomatic, Trim Galore! 

>> ○ **Unique molecule**

>>> ○ RNA quality is low if unique molecule count is below 10%

>> ○ **Sequencing depth**

>>> ○ # of reads

>>> ○ In cases of alternative splicing or allele-specific expression: >50 million reads are recommended

>>> ○ DEG analysis of a ribo-depleted library: Approximately 50-60 million total reads are recommended

>>> ○ A ribo-depleted library is recommended to have twice the sequencing depth compared to a poly-A selected library because the ribo-depleted library can capture a wider variety of RNA (e.g., tRNA, rRNA, immature RNA) that the poly-A selected library cannot capture.

>> ○ **Sequencing read length**

>>> ○ Small fragments: Adaptor binding starts, requiring adaptor trimming

>>> ○ Advantages of long-read sequencing compared to short-read sequencing: lower cost per nucleotide, more accurate mapping, ability to identify splice junctions, capability to detect allele-specific expression, ability to resolve repetitive sequences.

>>> ○ Disadvantages of long-read sequencing compared to short-read sequencing: higher overall cost, higher cost per read, requires more adaptor trimming. Long-read sequencing (PacBio, Oxford Nanopore) is more likely to contain adapter sequences due to its sequencing method, which involves repetitive reading and single-molecule sequencing.

>> ○ **Adaptor sequence**

>>> ○ **Issue 1:** Since adapter sequences are artificial, they can cause alignment and variant calling to fail or introduce biases.

>>> ○ **Issue 2:** Adapter sequences contain identical sequences, leading to biases in coverage analysis and differential gene expression (DEG) analysis.

>>> ○ To remove adapter sequences, tools such as AdaptorRemoval, Cutadapt, Trimmomatic, and bbduk.sh are used.

>> ○ **Exonic portion**

>>> ○ In the case of poly-A(+) RNA-seq, exonic reads account for 50 to 70%.

>>> ○ In the case of rRNA(-) RNA-seq, the proportion of exonic reads decreases.

>> ○ **Paired-end vs Single-end**

>>> ○ Single end reads: Each library fragment is sequenced only from a single end.

>>> ○ Paired end reads: Each library fragment is sequenced from both ends. 

>>> ○ Paired-end (PE) reads are more accurate than single-end (SE) reads but are approximately twice as expensive.  

>>> ○ If the goal is simply to calculate gene counts for DEG analysis, SE is sufficient.  

>>> ○ SE is recommended when RNA is significantly degraded.  

>>> ○ It's better to avoid using PE on short fragments to prevent inefficiencies caused by sequencing the same nucleotide.

**Figure 2.** Inefficiencies that can occur in paired-end (PE) sequencing

<br>

>> ○ **Mate pair reads** 

>>> ○ A longer segment of DNA is circularized and reads from the joint region are sequenced (both ends).

>> ○ **Strand-specific** (ssRNA-seq)

>>> ○ Can be either forward or reverse.

>> ○ **Poly-A selection vs Ribo-depletion**

>>> ○ Advantages of a ribo-depletion library

>>>> ○ Works even with RNA degradation: cDNA fragments are uneven and short. Poly-A selection is highly biased toward the 3' end, making it less accurate.

>>>> ○ Suitable for studying non-coding RNA.

>>> ○ Disadvantages of a ribo-depletion library

>>>> ○ Expensive.

>>>> ○ Includes a large number of meaningless reads. 

> ② QC metrics for ChIP-seq

>> ○ [Mapping ratio](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202320300591)

>> ○ SPOT(signal portion in tags): Indicates good signal-to-noise ratio.

>> ○ IDR (irreproducibility discovery rate) ([ref1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3431496/), [ref2](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-5/issue-3/Measuring-reproducibility-of-high-throughput-experiments/10.1214/11-AOAS466.full))

>> ○ denQCi, simQCi, QC-STAMP ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3834836/))

>> ○ Motif analysis: What % of peaks contain the TF motif, and does the motif tend to occur in the middle of the peak? Not expected for all peaks, because a TF may bind as part of a protein complex or a heterodimer.

>> ○ Fragment length distribution: This refers to the distribution of fragment lengths, such as single nucleosome, dimer, trimer, etc. It is relevant for techniques like CUT&Tag and ATAC-seq.

>> ○ IP enrichment strength: A graph representing the ratio of reads to bin proportions. Tools like deepTools or CHANCE can be used for analysis. This takes advantage of the fact that the peak ratio appears narrowly distributed across the entire window.

>> ○ Strand lag: The actual binding site signal exhibits a lag between signals on the + strand and - strand. Tools like ZINBA and PePR remove artifact signals that do not exhibit strand lag.

## **3. `QC 3.`** Filtering

⑴ **Type 1:** Filtering during data processing

> ① Removal of inappropriate reads from sequencing data to generate trimmed data

> ② **Example 1:** Adapter Sequence

>> ○ **Issue 1:** Since adapter sequences are artificial, they can cause alignment and variant calling failures or introduce biases.

>> ○ **Issue 2:** Adapter sequences contain identical sequences, leading to biases in coverage analysis and differential gene expression (DEG) analysis.

>> ○ If the fragment is too short, the adapter sequence starts to be read. → In this case, adapter trimming is performed.

>> ○ Long-read sequencing requires more adapter trimming. → Long-read sequencing (PacBio, Oxford Nanopore) is more likely to contain adapter sequences due to its sequencing method, which involves repetitive reading and single-molecule sequencing.

>> ○ To remove adapter sequences, tools such as AdaptorRemoval, Cutadapt, [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic), and bbduk.sh are used.

⑵ **Type 2:** Filtering in downstream analysis

> ① **2-1.** **Gene filtering:** Excluding genes with low expression to avoid capturing non-informative or unrealistically DEG genes

> ② **2-2.** **Barcode filtering**

>> ○ **Case 1:** Low RNA expression (e.g., poor QC results)

>> ○ **Case 2:** High RNA expression (e.g., contamination due to RNA diffusion)

>> ○ **Case 3.** Doublet removal: scdDblFinder (R-based), hybrid score of scds (R-based), doubletCells of scran (R-based)

> ③ Can be implemented using the subset function in the R Seurat pipeline, matrix operations in Python scanpy, etc.

## **4. `QC 4.`** Alignment

⑴ Definition: Process of finding the location of a specific sequencing read within a genome or transcriptome

⑵ **Step 1:** Raw data preparation: File extension is `.Fastq`

> ① **Type 1:** Single-end sequencing (SES): Sequencing using one side of the adapter

> ② **Type 2:** Paired-end sequencing (PES): Sequencing using both sides of the adapter

>> ○ [dUTP method](https://jb243.github.io/pages/75#:~:text=%E2%91%A9%20%EC%9D%91%EC%9A%A9%201.-,dUTP%20method,-%3A%20strand%2Dspecific) standard: "_1.fastq" represents first strand (anti-sense), "_2.fastq" represents second strand (sense; original RNA sequence)

>> ○ First, perform sequencing through one adapter (obtain Read1), and then perform sequencing through the opposite adapter (obtain Read2).

>> ○ Read1 and Read2 from the same DNA fragment can be easily matched because they come from the same cluster.

>> ○ Advantages: Higher accuracy (due to comparison between Read1 and Read2), easy extraction of DNA mutations, easy analysis of repetitive sequences, easy mapping between different species.

>> ○ Disadvantages: Higher cost, requires more steps than SES.

>> ○ Overview

>>> ○ Definition: The process of determining how two or more sequences align with each other. In other words, pattern matching.  

>>> ○ Motif: A specific pattern or subsequence that appears repeatedly in a given sequence. Motifs are often associated with biological functions.  

>>> ○ **Purpose 1.** To identify the similarity between two sequences for use in processes such as mapping and assembly.  

>>> ○ **Purpose 2.** Variation Identification: Detecting variations such as insertions, deletions, and substitutions.  

>> ○ Pattern matching: The concepts of PFM and PWM

>> ○ Compression: **BWT**(Burrows-Wheeler transform)

>>> ○ History: Centered around David Wheeler  

>>>> ○ First to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science: 1951, University of Cambridge.

>>>> ○ First to invent a programming language.

>>>> ○ Invented the concept of functions in computer programming together with Maurice Wilkes and Stanley Gill.

>>>> ○ Discovered BWT while working as a consultant at Bell Labs in the early 1980s.

>>>> ○ Published BWT with Michael Burrows ten years later.

>>> ○ **Step 1.** When the input string is `mississippi`, append `$` at the end to generate the matrix of all cyclic rotations.  

>>> ○ **Step 2.** Consider `$` as the first character and sort the matrix in alphabetical order to obtain the BWT matrix.  

>>>> ○ In the figure below, `i` is called the SA index, and due to **Feature 3**, it must be stored together.

<br>

**Figure 7.** How to calculate BWT matrix

<br>

>>> ○ **Step 3.** Apply run-length encoding to the last column of the BWT matrix to obtain the BWT transformation. 

>>>> ○ Last column of the BWT matrix: `ipssm$pissii`  

>>>> ○ Run-length encoding: `ipssm$piissi` or `ip2sm$pi2s2i`  

>>> ○ **Feature 1.** It tends to organize a string that contains repeats into runs of consecutive characters. An efficient compression technique.

>>>> ○ When constructing the BWT matrix, sorting in alphabetical order allows repetitive sequences to be easily grouped by the same alphabet.  

>>>> ○ Using this method, even the human genome, which contains many repetitive sequences, can be compressed to approximately 750 MB.

>>> ○ **Feature 2.** The BWT is invertible i.e. given the BWT of a string you can recover the original string without any additional information.

>>>> ○ If the BWT transformation is `ippssm$piissi`, the first column of the BWT matrix becomes `$iiiimppssss`, which is the alphabetically sorted sequence of the BWT transformation. 

>>>> ○ The end of the input string is naturally `$`, and by looking at the first row of the BWT matrix, we can determine that the input string ends with `i$`.

>>>> ○ In the BWT matrix, the row starting with `i$` is easily identified as the second row, which is the first row that starts with `i`.

>>>> ○ Following this method, we can identify the **LF (last-first) property**, which allows us to reconstruct the original input string. 

>>>> ○ **LF property**: For a given character, the k-th occurrence in the first column of the BWT matrix corresponds to the k-th occurrence in the last column.

>>> ○ **Feature 3.** Fast pattern matching with BWT: Assume the pattern is `sis`.

>>>> ○ If the BWT transformation is `ippssm$piissi`, the first column of the BWT matrix becomes `$iiiimppssss`, which is the alphabetically sorted sequence of the BWT transformation. 

>>>> ○ To search for <code><u>si</u>s</code> (first two letters `si`), find rows in the BWT matrix where the last column is `s` and the first column is `i`: SA index = 8, 5.

>>>> ○ To search for <code>s<u>is</u></code> (last two letters `is`), find rows in the BWT matrix where the last column is `i` and the first column is `s`: SA index = 6, 3.

>>>> ○ **Method 1.** According to the LF property, for `i` to be common, the corresponding SA index values must be 5 and 6.

>>>> ○ **Method 2.** The SA index values must differ by exactly 1, meaning they should be 5 and 6.

>>>> ○ **Method 3.** Execute the following algorithm concerning the number of letters that appear alphabetically before it, `count`, and the frequency of that letter, `occur`. If multiple rows are output, it means multiple matches were found.

> ② **Process 2.** Mapping

>> ○ Definition: Storing sequences in a hash table and using this table to map similar sections between different sequences.

>> ○ Background: All-vs-all sequence comparison consumes astronomical amounts of time, thus it's necessary to find short, representative hash values for each sequence.

>> ○ General Process:

>>> ○ **Step 1:** Divide the given sequence into several sliding windows.

>>> ○ **Step 2:** Search for all contiguous sequences of k elements within each sliding window.

>>> ○ **Step 3:** Among the k contiguous sequences, the lexicographically smallest sequence is the minimizer for that window.

>>> ○ **Step 4:** Apply a quaternary number system to the minimizer (i.e., A = 0, C = 1, T = 2, G = 3) to translate the minimizer into a specific value.

>>> ○ **Step 5:** Apply a hash function to the minimizer to generate a hash value, aiming to alleviate base distribution asymmetry and increase database efficiency.

>>> ○ **Step 6:** Store each minimizer from every window in the corresponding element of the hash table based on its hash value.

>>> ○ **Step 7:** Generate a set of minimizers from the query sequence (the sequence of interest).

>>> ○ **Step 8:** Generate a set of minimizers from the target sequence (the reference sequence).

>>> ○ **Step 9:** Search for minimizer hits: compare the minimizer sets of the query and target sequences to explore similar sections between the two sequences.

>>> ○ Note on Hash Function: The hash function does not necessarily need to be reversible, but [hash collision pairs](https://jb243.github.io/pages/875) should not be easily discovered.

>>> ○ Advantages of the Mapping Process: Speeds up comparisons between different sequences and ensures the pipeline operates robustly even in the presence of noise or many [SNPs](https://jb243.github.io/pages/77).

> ③ **Process 3:** Error-Correction

>> ○ Definition: Correcting errors from the sequencing process. 0.2% - 0.5% for Illumina sequencing or higher in long read sequencing.

>> ○ Requirement: A specific k-mer in the given sequence has a low frequency, a substitute k-mer with a close Hamming distance exists, and replacing it with the substitute k-mer does not generate any newly defined k-mers regardless of how the segment is defined.

⑷ **Step 3.** (_optional_) **QC**

> ① [SAMtools](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/16/2078/204688?login=true): Possible to use SAMtools view. Filtering by flags is possible. ([ref](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html))

⑸ **Step 4.** **sorting:** Sorting BAM files along the alignment axis.

> ① [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) ([release](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases), [trouble-
shooting](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2292#:~:text=default%2Djre-,57,-.%20Error%3A%20LinkageError%20occurred))

<br>

```python
# How to install java on Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk

java -jar picard.jar SortSam \
      INPUT=input.bam \
      OUTPUT=sorted_output.bam \
      SORT_ORDER=coordinate
```

<br>

> ② [SAMtools](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/16/2078/204688?login=true)

<br>

```python
# install in Linux
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samtools

# execution of samtools
samtools sort -o sorted_file.bam input_file.bam
```

<br>

> ③ name-sorted: Typically, sorting is done based on the read name.

> ④ coordinate-sorted: For example, the `possorted_genome_bam.bam file` created in SpaceRanger is position-sorted.

⑹ **Step 5.** **marking:** Marking duplicates arising from PCR amplification.

> ① Generally, DNA-seq involves removing duplicates, while RNA-seq does not: In RNA-seq, the same sequence may repeatedly appear not only due to technical duplicates but also due to high expressing transcripts or short genes. Removing these biological duplicates can reduce the dynamic range of the data or decrease statistical power.

> ② [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) MarkDuplicates

<br>

```python
java -jar picard.jar MarkDuplicates INPUT=sorted_file.bam OUTPUT=marked_duplicates.bam METRICS_FILE=metrics.txt
```

<br>

> ③ [SAMtools](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/16/2078/204688?login=true) rmdup

<br>

```python
samtools markdup -r -s sorted.bam marked_duplicates.bam
```

<br>

>> ○ `-s`: single-end read. If paired-end read, remove this part.

> ④ Trimmomatic

> ⑤ Trim Galore!  

⑺ **Step 6.** **indexing :** `.bam.bai file` is generated from `.bam file`.

> ① [SAMtools](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/16/2078/204688?login=true)

<br>

```python
samtools index marked_duplicates.bam
```

<br>

⑻ **Step 7.** **Count:** Determining which feature (e.g., gene, exon) a read originated from when there is a read.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/7defebad-e111-4f75-9789-4b129e08522c)

**Figure 11.** Counting process (from HTSeq)

<br>

> ① Algorithms determining whether a read came from gene A or gene B when there is a read.

> ② **Type 1.** HTSeq

>> ○ A tool based on gene overlap.

>> ○ **Most commonly used** counting algorithm.

>> ○ Default is union.

>> ○ Command example:

<br>

```python
# install
pip install HTSeq

htseq-count -f bam -r pos -s no -i gene_id -t exon mouse_sample.bam Mus_musculus.GRCm38.99.gtf > output.count
```

<br>

>>> `○ -f bam`: Specifies that the input file is a `.bam file`.

>>> ○ `-r pos`: Ensures that the feature order in the output file matches the order in the reference.

>>> ○ `-s no`: `-s` indicates whether the sequencing data is strand-specific. `-s no` specifies that the data is not strand-specific, meaning the reads' transcriptional direction (strand) is not considered. For strand-specific data, you should use `-s yes` (forward strand) or `-s reverse` (reverse strand).

>>> ○ `-i gene_id`: Uses the gene_id attribute from the GTF file as the reference for each feature. transcript_id is also possible.

>>> ○ `-t exon`: Specifies feature type. Default is exon.

>>> ○ `Mus_musculus.GRCm38.99.gtf`: Reference name. Can use `.gff` file instead of `.gtf`.

>>> ○ `> output.txt`: Outputs count result to output.txt file.

>> ○ Result example:

>> ○ Simple counting algorithm without assembly process.

>> ○ **Issue 1.** When there are multiple isoforms, shared reads are either consistently counted as +1 or discarded, leading to inaccurate counts.

>> ○ **Issue 2:** Decreased accuracy when counting at the transcript level compared to the gene level

>>> **○** Gene count > Sum of isoform counts that constitute each gene ( **∵** ambiguous reads)

>>> **○** Using genome-aligned data for transcript alignment without separate assembly can be inaccurate

>>> ○ Due to high similarity between transcripts, distinguishing by sequencing technology can be extremely challenging

> ③ **Type 2.** [RSEM](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM)

>> ○ Utilizes the EM (expectation maximization) technique to accurately predict counts.

>> ○ Isoform quantification is possible.

```

<br>

>> ○ **Step 3:** Expression estimation

<br>

```python
# case 1. single-end
rsem-calculate-expression --single-end --alignments -p 4 aligned_reads.sam reference_name sample_output

# case 2. paired-end

```python
# install
conda install -c bioconda stringtie

# count
stringtie sorted_bam.bam -o output.gtf -G reference.gtf -A gene_abundances.tsv
```

<br>

>> ○ genome-based: (Comment) StringTie's method for transcript-level abundance is not straightforward

>> ○ Includes assembly process.

>> ○ Takes `sorted_bam.bam file` from genome-aligned reads as input, outputs separate `output.gtf file`.

>> ○ For gene-level analysis, **tximport** is used.  

>> ○ **Step 1.** ab initio or de novo assembly  

>> ○ **Step 2.** Construct a HASH table: Index the positions of distinct k-mers.  

>> ○ **Step 3.** Build a **suffix array**: Annotate the suffixes of k-mers.  

>> ○ **Step 4.** Quasi-mapping

>>> ○ **4-1.** Scan the read from left to right: Scan until a k-mer is found in the hash table. Identify the suffixes of the detected k-mer.  

>>> ○ **4-2.** Identify the MMP (Minimum Mapping Position): Find the longest matching read sequence with exact matches to determine the MMP.  

>>> ○ **4-3.** Identify the NIP (Next In Position) assuming mismatches: Account for sequencing errors or natural variations in the read by skipping one k-mer to identify the NIP. Instead of stopping where the current match is disrupted, search for the next matching k-mer to increase the likelihood of mapping the entire read.  

>>> ○ **4-4.** Repeat steps **4-1** and **4-2** until the end of the read is reached to complete quasi-mapping.  

>> ○ **Step 5.** Quantify transcript abundance using the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm.

## **5. `QC 5.`** Normalization

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Correction for biases where RNA reads do not accurately reflect gene expression due to technical limitations

> ② In essence, correcting systemic batch effects like library size

⑵ **Type 1. library size normalization** (Depth-based normalization)

> ① When comparing different samples, divide each sample by a normalization factor to adjust for the total RNA transcripts count

>> ○ In other words, to compare specific gene expression between samples

>> ○ Sequencing depth, a limitation specific to sequencing machines, can be referred to as library size

> ② **1-1.** **RPM (reads per million mapped reads)** or **CPM (counts per million mapped reads)**

>> ○ Divide each gene count by the total count of the sample and multiply by 10^6

# Calculate the cpm

> ③ **1-2.** **TMM** (trimmed mean of M-values) ([ref](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25))

>> ○ Definition: Normalize given read counts by dividing by the total read count of the sample + Trimming

>> ○ Proposed by Robinson & Oshlack (2010) ([ref](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25))

>> ○ Since trimming is performed, the library size does not remain constant.

>> ○ **Significance** **1.** Corrects the bias where read count does not accurately represent actual gene activity and is proportional to sequencing depth([ref](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25#:~:text=Estimated%20normalization%20factors,factor%20of%202.))

>>> ○ **Condition:** Ensure genes with the same expression levels in both samples are not detected as DEGs

>>> ○ **Assumption:** Majority of genes are not differentially expressed (consistent with author's experience)

>>> ○ **Thought experiment**

>>>> ○ Sample A is a mixture of human + mouse RNA, Sample B is specifically human RNA from Sample A, both samples having equal human and mouse RNA counts

>>>> ○ When depths are equal, human RNA reads in A would be exactly half of B's human RNA reads: reads in A are distributed over genes twice as much

>>>> ○ To adjust each gene's RNA read count in A, multiply by a factor (normalization factor) twice that of B's

>>>> ○ This assumption leads to batch + sample effect ≃ batch effect, making the normalization method applicable only in this case

>> ○ **Significance 2.** Determining total RNA production Sk is difficult, but calculating the ratio Sk / Sk' for two samples is relatively easy

>> ○ Brief definition: Divide given read count by the sample's total count

>>> ○ Example

>> ○ Generally uses the upper 75% (lower 25%) quartile values as variables (cf. Q3-norm).

# Check out the UQ normalized result
head(UQ)
```

<br>

⑶ **Type 2.** Gene Length Normalization

> ① Definition: A method of correcting for gene length when comparing the expression of different genes (or exons, isoforms) within a single sample.

>> ○ Here, gene length refers to the effective length, which is the actual gene length minus the read length.

>> ○ Gene length correction: Gene counts are proportional to gene length, so count values are divided by gene length.

>> ○ Gene length normalization is criticized for not properly reflecting data characteristics, with decreasing importance of metrics like FPKM, TPM.

> ② **2-1.** RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of Transcript per Million Mapped Reads)

>> ○ Formula: RPKM for gene i is represented as Q reads and ℓ exon length.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/cbc805f1-6e24-41df-9f85-def5ccd193c3)

<br>

>> ○ Used to compare gene expression among different genes within a sample.

>> ○ **Example:** 25,000 reads in gene / (0.5 kb gene × 40 million reads) = 1,250 

> ③ **2-2.** FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of Exon per Million Mapped Fragments)

>> ○ Formula: FPKM for gene i is represented as q reads and ℓ exon length.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/6457560c-7b13-475f-be25-23bb6ab4de54)

<br>

>> ○ Fragment refers to a pair of reads in paired-end sequencing.

>> ○ Similar to RPKM, but used only for paired-end RNA-seq (Trapnell et al., 2010).

>> ○ **Example:** 25,000 paired end fragments in gene / (0.5 kb gene × 40 million paired end reads) = 1,250 

> ④ **2-3.** TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million): Proposed by Li et al. (2010)

>> ○ Definition: Normalized based on how many molecule from this gene for each 1M RNA molecules in the sample.

>> ○ **The only difference from RPKM**: When calculating TPM, you normalize for gene length first, and then normalize for sequencing depth secondly.

>> ○ Relatively easy to use due to length-based normalization, more common than CPM.

>> ○ Summing TPM values in a single library gives 1,000,000, allowing **comparison between different samples**.

<br>

>> ○ Relation between TPM and RPKM: For the number of genes n,

<br>

>> ○ TPM is highly correlated with RPKM (or FPKM) results

⑷ **Type 3.** Log-Transformation

> ① **Purpose 1:** For genes with high count values, the actual activity of those genes may be exaggerated in interpretation.

> ② **Purpose 2:** When there are both very small and very large values, it is necessary to adjust the scale to be similar.

> ③ To address the above issues, the results of log-transforming the normalized counts are considered as gene expression values.

⑸ **Type 4.** scaling (e.g., z-score transformation)

> ① For each patient and each sample, the range of gene expression values varies. To compare them rationally, the range of values is adjusted.

> ② For example: In the case of the [TCGA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1694), [Seurat](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1788) pipeline, the maximum gene expression value is set to around 10 → the minimum value generally becomes negative.

⑹ **Type 5.** Feature selection, Cell selection

⑺ R: Obtaining normalized expression using the [Seurat](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1788) package.

> ○ The count data were normalized by log2-transformation of counts per million (CPM) + 1 pseudocount, and scatter plots were generated for each pair of consecutive section using the ggplot2 package (28) in R Studio (versioin 1.1.453). The built-in stats package was used to compute Pearson correlations. ([ref](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/78/20/5970/631815/Spatially-Resolved-Transcriptomics-Enables))

## **6. `QC 6.`** Batch Effect

⑴ Overview

> ① Background: Apart from experimental variables, batch effects can influence results between experimental and control groups.

> ② Batch Effect: Experimental outcomes affected by factors other than biological variables. Examples include:

>> ○ Sequencing dates

>> ○ Researchers performing sequencing

>> ○ Sequencing equipment

>> ○ Protocols

> ③ Systemic batch effects like library size can be corrected through normalization.

> ④ Batch effect removal process referred to as removing non-biological batch effects, often using regression analysis.

⑵ Batch Effect Removal

> ① This is particularly important in DEG analysis through comparison between samples.

> ② Caution

<br>

```python
    batch condition
    <factor> <factor>
1          1        A 
2          1        A
3          1        B
4          1        B
5          2        C
6          2        C
```

<br>

>> ○ Batch effects cannot be theoretically removed if a specific condition applies to a specific batch.

>> ○ However, even in this case, it is possible to create an incomplete regression model by distinguishing between batch effect and covariate to remove the batch effect.

> ③ **Method 1:** limma::removeBatchEffect: Removes batch effects by inputting normalized expression matrix and batch information into a linear model. ([ref](https://rdrr.io/bioc/limma/man/removeBatchEffect.html))

> ④ **Method 2:** sva::ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007): Empirical Bayes-based method for removing batch effects when batch information is known.
([ref](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/sva/inst/doc/sva.pdf), [ref](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/scanpy.pp.combat.html), [ref](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/8/1/118/252073))

# Import the sva package

# Create batch vector
batch <- c(1,2,3,1,2,3)

# Apply parametric empirical Bayes frameworks adjustment to remove the batch effects
combat_edate_par = ComBat(dat=TMM, batch=batch, mod=NULL, par.prior=TRUE, prior.plots=TRUE)

# Check out the adjusted expression profiles
head(combat_edate_par)
head(combat_edate_non_par)
```

<br>

> ⑤ **Method 3:** ComBat_seq (Zhang et al., 2020): Takes raw count matrix and outputs adjusted count matrix. Batch information should be known.

<br>

```python
library(sva)

# Create batch vector
batch <- c(1,2,3,1,2,3)

# Include group condition
combat_seq_with_group <- ComBat_seq(raw_counts_matrix, batch=batch, group=group, full_mod=TRUE)
# Without group condition
combat_seq_without_group <- ComBat_seq(raw_counts_matrix, batch=batch, group=NULL, full_mod=FALSE)

# Check out the adjusted expression profiles
head(combat_seq_with_group)
head(combat_seq_without_group)
```

<br>

> ⑥ **Method 4:** SVA seq (Leek, 2014): Functions even without known batch information.

> ⑦ **Method 5:** RUV seq (Risso et al., 2014)

⑶ Measurement of the accuracy of batch effect removal

> ① k-nearest-neighbor batch effect test (kBET)

> ② ASW across batches

> ③ k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph connectivity

> ④ batch removal using PCA regression

⑷ Application 1: Clustering and Batch Effect

> ① Clustering can be used for batch effect removal by dividing experimental and control groups within major clusters (e.g., cell type clusters) to obtain DEGs.

⑸ Application 2: Data Integration

> ① Merging data from different batches or modalities, with consideration of batch correction effects.

> ② Modifying two groups to have the same characteristics.

>> ○ **Example 1:** Train the model so that the clustering patterns are not affected by batch effects.

>> ○ **Example 2:** Train the model to minimize the discriminator's performance, which distinguishes data based on batch-specific effects (i.e., to make the data indistinguishable after integration).

> ④ **Method 2.** Seurat V1 and V2: Uses CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis)

>> ○ Has a single data slot for expression values that stores either raw counts or normalized data.

>> ○ Designed primarily for single modalities.

>> ○ If the batch effect is large or there are few common cell subsets, integration is not effective.

>> ○ [CCA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2158#8-others)-based Data Integration: This method aggressively aligns the two groups.  

>> ○ [RPCA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2158#8-others)-based Data Integration: This method performs a less aggressive alignment of the two groups, making it useful when the tissue characteristics of the two datasets are significantly different.

> ⑤ **Method 3.** [Seurat V3](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30559-8)

>> ○ **Step 1.** Perform dimensional reduction on both the reference and query datasets using [diagonalized CCA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2158#8-type-7-cca).

>> ○ **Step 2.** Apply L2-norm to the canonical correlation vector.  

>> ○ **Step 3.** Compute MNN (Mutual Nearest Neighbors) to explore the low-dimensional representation shared by both datasets: This involves identifying and linking cells that have the same context within the dataset. These linked cell pairs are referred to as anchors.

>> ○ **Step 4.** Score the anchors and remove incorrectly linked low-confidence anchors: The score is defined as shared neighbor overlap.

>> ○ **Step 5.** Define the weighted distance: Given the i-th anchor a<sub>i</sub>, query cell c, and anchor score S<sub>i</sub>,

## **8. `Common 2.`** Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Analysis

⑴ Definition: Process of finding genes that differ between experimental and control groups.

⑵ Criteria for DEG: Slightly varies depending on experimental design.

> ① Experimental design

<br>

<img width="507" alt="스크린샷 2025-02-16 오전 8 32 28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3dbd041-dd98-476b-85fa-e8376f3f90e4" />

**Figure 15.** Design matrix

<br>

> ① FC (fold change)

>> ○ Definition: Ratio of treatment's average gene expression to control's average gene expression.

>> ○ **Issue 1.** Division by zero: Genes with such issues are either removed beforehand or assigned special values through separate interpretations.

>> ○ **Issue 2.** Asymmetrical values around 1: Addressed by using log fold change.

> ② [Adjusted p-value](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1631)

>> ○ Multiple Testing Problem: The act of conducting multiple statistical tests itself can lead to inaccurate conclusions.

>> ○ **Type 1.** Control of Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)

>>> ○ Definition: The probability of reaching at least one incorrect conclusion among all hypotheses tested. For instance, a FWER of 5% means there is a less than 5% chance of making even one incorrect conclusion across multiple hypothesis tests. This approach is very conservative, allowing almost no false positives.

>>> ○ **1-1.** Sidak Correction: Adjusts the alpha threshold rather than the p-values and is used when p-values are independent.

>>> ○ **1-2.** Bonferroni Correction: Directly adjusts each p-value and can be applied even when p-values are not independent. It is highly conservative.

>> ○ **Type 2.** Control of False Discovery Rate (FDR)

>>> ○ Definition: The method of controlling the probability that a null hypothesis is included among the actually rejected hypotheses (FDR, the rate of Type I errors) to be below a certain level.

>>> ○ **2-1.** Benjamini–Hochberg (B&H): Used when the correlations between tests are relatively simple.

>>> ○ **2-2.** Benjamini–Yekutieli (B&Y): Used when the correlations between tests are complex.

>> ○ **Type 3.** FWER and FDR control can be applied simultaneously.

> ③ **Visualization 1.** Volcano plot

>> ○ x-axis: log fold change

>> ○ y-axis: log adjusted p-value

>> ○ Useful for visualizing the distribution of genes satisfying the DEG condition.

> ④ **Visualization 2.** MA plot

>> ○ x-axis: Mean of log normalized count

>> ○ y-axis: log fold change

>> Widely used in microarray analysis and applicable to RNA-seq.

⑶ Statistical Techniques

> ① t test

>> ○ One of the commonly used statistical techniques

>> ○ Parametric statistical estimation

>> ○ Applies t-test after taking the log of expression (FPKM/TPM)

>> ○ Not recommended for small sample sizes due to difficult variance estimation: In this case, DESeq, EdgeR, limma are recommended

>> ○ Strict application of FC threshold is recommended

> ② [Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2099#2-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test)

>> ○ Non-parametric statistical estimation

>> ○ Not recommended for sample sizes less than 10

>> ○ For small samples, it is recommended to use limma, edgeR, DESeq2, etc.

> ③ [ANOVA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1635) & [Kruskal-Wallis test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1688)

>> ○ Used for multi-level single factor DEG analysis

>> ○ For sample sizes less than 10, it's recommended to use DESeq2, edgeR, limma's multi-level single factor mode

> ④ FC cutoff 

>> ○ Fold change cutoff implicitly assumes a constant variange, e.g. from prior. 

⑷ DEG Tools

> ① DESeq, [DESeq2](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2202) ([paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8), [manual](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html))

>> ○ Input: raw count

>> ○ Assumes that we can obtain better variance estimates of genes without assuming that they all have the same variance.

>> ○ Does not support random effect modeling or mixed effect modeling: limma is somewhat flexible, so it can be done.

>> ○ Based on the [negative binomial model](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1626#7-negative-binomial-distribution-)

>>> ○ The transcriptome has a large variance due to many zero counts, making it more preferred over the [normal](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1627#2-normal-distribution) or [Poisson distribution](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1626#9-poisson-distribution).

>>> ○ The negative binomial model can be sensitive to outliers: Newest version of DESeq2 add extra features to be robust to outliers.

>> ○ Estimate variance using the empirical Bayes model under the following two options:

>> ○ **Option 1.** dispersion

>>> ○ **Step 1.** Perform maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for each gene to obtain the black data points in the graph.

>>> ○ **Step 2.** Derive the red trend line from the black points, which serves as the prior mean.

>>> ○ **Step 3.** Compute the MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimate, indicated by the blue arrows.

>>> ○ **Step 4.** Data points that are not shrunk towards the prior can be considered outliers, marked with blue circles.

**Figure 16.** DESeq dispersion mode

<br>

>> ○ **Option 2.** fold change (optional)

>>> ○ DESeq2 provides shrinkage for log2FC estimate (older version set this as default): lfcShrink()

>>> ○ LFC for all genes are first used as prior to estimate the trend, and "shrink" the LFC likelihood estimate.

>>> ○ Example: In the following figure, you can see that the green data points, which have a high likelihood for the data, are not well shrunk towards the prior.

**Figure 17.** DESeq fold change mode

Black line: prior
Solid line: unshrunken estimate
Dotted line: shrunken LFC estimate

<br>

>> ○ Flags outlier for each gene using Cook's distance: The distance is a metric to measure the influence of a data point in least-square analysis.

>>> ○ Small sample size: Remove gene from analysis.

>>> ○ Large sample size: If there are samples detected as outliers for a specific gene, exclude those samples from the analysis.

>> ○ Note the different preprocessing methods for obtaining DEGs and visualization.

> ② edgeR

>> ○ edgeR (exact), edgeR (GLM)

>> ○ Uses TMM normalization and negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM).

>> ○ edgeR by default filters out genes with <5 reads total to estimate a common dispersion value.

>> ○ Several options to estimate dispersion

>>> ○ Common: Uses single, common dispersion estimate. Not recommended.

>>> ○ Trended: Estimate from the trend function.

>>> ○ Tagwise: Bayesian moderated approach, similar to DESeq2.

> ③ edgeR-QLF

>> ○ Models variance as Var(y<sub>gi</sub>) = σ<sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup>(μ<sub>gi</sub> + μ<sub>gi</sub><sup>2</sup>φ) to allow for over-dispersion.

>> ○ Dispersion φ: A function of gene abundance (φ(A)), and it fits dispersion for the trend estimate for the empirical mean-variance relationship.

>> ○ σ<sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup> is a gene-specific variance (quasi-dispersion parameter). This is fit with an empirical Bayes method. A trend funciton is fit between the gene abundance and the raw QL dispersion estimates. The raw QL estimate (likelihood) then shrink towards the mean fitted trend for that abundance using the empirical Bayes approach.

>> ○ μ<sub>gi</sub> + μ<sub>gi</sub><sup>2</sup>φ (i.e. σ<sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup> = 1) corresponds to the variance of a standard negative binomial.

> ④ limma

>> ○ limma + voom ([paper](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/RNAseq123/inst/doc/limmaWorkflow.html), [manual](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf))

>>> ○ Input: raw count (avoid using normalized data like FPKM with voom)

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Convert read count to log CPM.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Use of empirical Bayes method (eBayes(); assumes normal distribution): Removes the correlation between mean and variance present in count data.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. DEG exploration based on Generalized Linear Model (GLM).

>>> ○ The matrix used for obtaining DEGs is also used for visualization

>>> ○ Assumes that we can obtain better variance estimates of genes without assuming that they all have the same variance.

>>> ○ Generally is more conservative than edgeR and DESeq2. 

>> ○ limma FPKM ([paper](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/56275/), [manual](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf))

>>> ○ Input: FPKM (useful when raw count data is not available)

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Convert FPKM to log2 scale

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Run limma's eBayes() function with the trend = TRUE option

>>> ○ This method is similar to what's used in microarray analysis and is akin to the limma-trend method

>> ○ Provides normalized expressions that remove batch effects and provides code to calculate DEGs based on them ([ref](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hiramcho/scrna-seq-differential-expression-with-scvi#4.-Differential-EXpression)).

>> ○ The provided code for calculating DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) is not only slow but also inaccurate: removing batch effects from 10 datasets might slightly differ from the removal in just 2 of those datasets, which can sometimes lead to completely opposite DEG patterns.

>> ○ It is recommended to use scVI normalized expression and `scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups` to identify DEGs.

## **9. `Common 3.`** Gene Set Analysis

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Analyzing gene sets as a whole, rather than individual genes.

> ② Terminology

>> ○ [Gene Score](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2215): Refers to the value generated by a list of genes.

>> ○ Signature: A dataframe composed of gene names, FC (fold change) values, or p-values. [Gene score](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2215) can also be considered a signature.

> ③ Principle: Create a contingency table and confirm significance using Fisher's exact test (hypergeometric test).

## **11. `Common 5.`** Cell Type Mapping Analysis

⑴ [General cell type annotation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1782)

> ① Purpose

>> ○ **Significance 1.** Cell type analysis in scRNA-seq and in-depth analysis of ROI in ST can effectively mitigate batch effects caused by sample selection bias.

>> ○ **Significance 2.** Analyzing based on cell types rather than gene expression analysis makes the results easier to understand.

> ② **Method 1.** Clustering-based

>> ○ Definition: Clustering scRNA-seq data and then labeling cell types based on the differential expression of genes within each cluster.

>> ○ **Drawback 1.** Divided by resolution parameter: Not all cells in the same cluster necessarily belong to the same cell type.

>> ○ **Drawback 2.** Cells of the same type might be split into different clusters depending on their states.

>> ○ **Drawback 3.** Comparing cell type labels across different platforms is challenging (e.g., immune cell vs DC vs cDC)

> ③ **Method 2.** Meta-tagging

>> ○ Definition: Attaching multiple cell types to a cell based on scores or multiple rounds of clustering.

>> ○ Example: Labeling a single cell as immune cell, DC, and cDC simultaneously.

**Table 7.** Summary of CNV Analysis Algorithms

<br>

> ⑮ Problems with InferCNV and CopyKat in contrast to Numbat ([ref](https://kharchenkolab.github.io/numbat/articles/numbat.html))

>> ○ Q: There seems to be a global baseline shift in the CNV profile produced by Numbat as compared to my other CNV callers; specifically, Numbat calls gains for the segments that appear to be neutral in other analyses, and neutral for segments that appear to be losses.

>> ○ A: Many existing methods (e.g. InferCNV/CopyKAT) infer copy number variations relative to the median ploidy, which can dilute signals of aberrant regions or mistake neutral regions for aberrant due to baseline shifts caused by hyperdiploidy or hypodiploidy. Instead, Numbat first tries to identify diploid regions based on allele evidence (balanced allelic frequencies), and uses these regions as baseline for CNV calling.

>> ○ **Step 2.** Shift size estimation (read extension): Line up + and - strand reads for single-end data (for ChIP-seq). For example, when there are two peaks at a certain distance on the + and - strands, shifting by 1/2 fragment size merges them into a single peak.

>> ○ **Step 3.** Determines window size: Most peak-finders use a sliding window.

>> ○ **Step 4.** Peak detection: Identify peaks in the ChIP sample that are not in the control sample. Involves a statistical test.

>> ○ **Step 5.** Deals with artifacts: Duplicates, strand difference, strand shift, etc.
