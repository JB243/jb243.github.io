## **1. Overview**

⑴ TensorFlow, Keras, and others are created for implementing artificial neural networks in Python.

⑵ A version compatible with R has been available since 2017.

⑶ MacBooks come with Terminal, so these are naturally installed.

⑷ Anaconda has been offering its services for a fee to users in businesses or government organizations with more than 200 employees since September 2020.

## **2. Installing Anaconda**

 ⑴ **Windows**

> ① **Step 1:** Installation website: [www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

> ② **Step 2:** Download and installation guide: [www.guru99.com/download-install-r-rstudio.html](https://www.guru99.com/download-install-r-rstudio.html)

> ③ **Step 3:** Finally, the following is installed:

>> ○ Jupyter Notebook (anaconda3)

>> ○ Anaconda Navigator (anaconda3)

>> ○ Spyder (anaconda3)

>> ○ Anaconda PowerShell Prompt (anaconda3)

>> ○ Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)

 ⑵ **For Linux**

⑵ **Linux**

> ① **Step 1.** [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) **:**
Install [Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh) from here

> ② **Step 1** - **Method 1**

>> ○ **Step 1.** Download the file from the [link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 

>> ○ **Step 2.** Move the `.sh` file to the desired directory in Linux: You can use commands like `cp`, `rsync`, `scp`

>> ○ `cp [OPTION] [SOURCE] [DESTINATION]`: Copy and paste the file

>>> ○ `-r`: Copy entire subdirectories and files

>>> ○ `-p`: Copy preserving owner, group, permissions, and timestamp information

>> ○ `scp`: Low chance of file corruption

>>> ○ `scp -P **${port}** **${srcFile}** **${id}** @ **${destIP}** : **${destPath}**`

>>>> ○ `**${port}**`: Port number of the destination

>>>> ○ `**${srcFile}**`: Path of the file to be moved from source. Example: "~/Downloads/file.txt"

>>>> ○ `**${id}**`: ID of a user at the destination

>>>> ○ `**${destIP}**`: IP address of the destination. Example: #.#.#.# (IPv4)

>>>> ○ `**${destPath}**`: Directory address to store the file at the destination. Example: ~/DATA1/1.txt

>>> ○ [Code generator](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2368#footnote_link_67_50)

>> ○ `rsync` (remote sync): Faster speed

>>> ○ `rsync --rsh=’ssh -p **${port}** ’ -avzhP **${srcFile}** **${id}**@**${destIP}** : **${destPath}**`

>>>> ○ `**${port}**`: Port number of the destination

>>>> ○ `**${srcFile}**`: Path of the file to be moved from source. Example: "~/Downloads/file.txt"

>>>> ○ `**${id}*`*: ID of a user at the destination

>>>> ○ `**${destIP}**`: IP address of the destination. Example: #.#.#.# (IPv4)

>>>> ○ `**${destPath}**`: Directory address to store the file at the destination. Example: ~/DATA1/1.txt

>>> ○ [Code generator](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2368)

> ③ **Step 1** - **Method 2**

>> ○ **Step 1.** Copy the download link for Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit from the link above

>> ○ **Step 2.** Use the `curl -o` command

>>> `curl -o my.sh "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_23.3.1-0-Linux-x86_64.sh"`

> ④ **Step 2.** Execute `.sh` file, Processing `.sh` file

>> ○ **File execution**: To execute a `.sh` file, you can do `./[My_File].sh`, `sh [My_File].sh`, or `bash [My_File].sh`.

>> ○ **File modification**: There are two kinds of shells, `zsh` and `bash`.

>>> ○ `$ vi script.sh`

>>> ○ `$ nano backup`

>>> ○ `$ sudo apt-get install zsh`

>> ○ **Granting permissions**

>>> ○ Example: $ `chmod +x run-md5sum.sh`

> ⑤ **Step 3.** Run the Miniconda .sh file and read the terms and conditions to proceed with the installation. Press Enter to continue.

> ⑥ **Step 4.** Respond to the license agreement:

>> ○ The response must be "yes" at the first prompt.

> ⑦ **Step 5.** Respond to the second "yes".

>> ○ Answer whether to perform the install init.

>> ○ The default is "no," but choosing "no" will prevent `/bin/bash` from functioning properly.

>> ○ It is recommended to explicitly enter "yes."

> ⑧ **Step 6.** Reboot your Linux system or run `/bin/bash`.

>> ○ If `/bin/bash` is not working, execute `source ~/.bashrc`.

<br>

<br>

## **3. Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)**

 ⑴ **For Windows**

> ① Run anaconda3: It is recommended to run it with administrator privileges.

> ② Install packages and set up virtual environments: Virtual environments are bundles of packages for managing package versions.

<br>

```python
Here's the translation of the provided text from Korean to English:

# 0. Move to the directory to install
cd C:/Users/sun/

# 1. Examples of package installation
conda install r-essentials
conda uninstall r-essentials
conda install -c conda-forge r-essentials=4.0

conda install tensorflow
conda install -c conda-forge keras
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# 2. Update base
conda update -n base conda
conda update --all

# 3. Create virtual environments tensorflow, tensorflow2
conda create --name tensorflow python=3.7
conda create --name tensorflow2 python=3.7

# 4. Check the list of virtual environments (base is default)
conda info --envs

# 5. Check Python version
python --version

# 6. Update virtual environment tensorflow
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow

# 7. Delete virtual environment tensorflow2
conda remove --name tensorflow2 --all

# 8. Activate virtual environment tensorflow
activate tensorflow

# 9. Clean up unused packages
conda clean --all
```

<br>

 ⑵ **For Linux**

> ① In Linux, once conda is installed, you can easily see if it's installed with (base) in front of the name.

> ② Base is the name of the default environment, and it changes to a different environment name (see below) when a new environment is installed.

> ③ Note that environments are stored in ./miniconda3/envs/.

 ⑶ Troubleshooting

> ① Avoid using Korean characters in usernames or file paths.

> ② (**Possible**) **Method 1:** Create a new user account with an English username and file path: Settings → Family & other users → Add someone else to this PC.

> ③ (**Not recommended**) **Method 2:** Changing the username: [www.tabmode.com/windows10/win10-user-name-change.html#gsc.tab=0](https://www.tabmode.com/windows10/win10-user-name-change.html#gsc.tab=0)

>> ○ Using this method may lead to the "Can't sign in to your Windows account" issue.

## **4. Installing Jupyter**

 ⑴ **Step 1.** Run anaconda3 and enter the following code (reference link: [wikidocs.net/25280](https://wikidocs.net/25280))

<br>

```python
activate tensorflow
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

<br>

 ⑵ **Step 2.** jupyter lab (optional)

<br>

```python
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

<br>

> ① jupyter lab is convenient for directory management.

> ② jupyter lab makes it easy to upload, delete, and rename files.

 ⑶ **Step 3.** Installing packages (e.g., tensorflow)

<br>

```python
# install tensorflow package
### tensorflow package version should be matched to python version 
pip install tensorflow

# You can specify the exact version of the package for the environment
pip install keras==2.2.4
# You can even remove previous packages
pip uninstall keras
pip install keras

# execute jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

<br>

> ① The author prefers installing as mentioned above.

> ② However, installing tensorflow.keras instead of keras may be beneficial for version management.

⑷ **Step 4.** Installing jupyter ipykernel

<br>

```python
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name JEONGBIN_ENV --display-name JEONGBIN_ENV

# List kernels
jupyter kernelspec list

# Remove kernels
jupyter kernelspec uninstall JEONGBIN_ENV
```

<br>

> ① Replace JEONGBIN_ENV with your environment name.

> ② You can easily change the environment of a launched Jupyter notebook through this.

> ③ The button for changing the kernel in Jupyter Notebook.

<br>

**Figure 1.** The button for changing the kernel in Jupyter Notebook.

<br>

⑸ **Step 5.** Running Jupyter Notebook

> ① **Step 5-1.** Click New in the upper right corner of the browser → Python 3.

>> ○ If R is installed in Jupyter, R will also be displayed under Python 3 in **Step 1**.

> ② **Step 5-2.** Enter code → Run.

> ③ Jupyter Notebook Key Shortcuts

>> ○ a: Add a new cell above the current cell

>> ○ b: Add a new cell below the current cell

>> ○ z: Undo the action 

>> ○ Shift + Up/Down Arrow: Select multiple consecutive cells

>> ○ Command (⌘) + Enter: Execute the current cell

>> ○ Command (⌘) + f: Find a string

>> ○ Command (⌘) + s: Save

<br>

<br>

## **5. Sharing Anaconda Environment**

⑴ Environment File (`.yml`): The simplest method

> ① **step 1.** Extracting the environment file: Extract a `.yml` file from the environment named JEONGBIN_ENV.

<br>

```python
conda activate JEONGBIN_ENV
conda env export > environment.yml
# Now you can see environment.yml at the mother directory.
```

<br>

> ② **step 2.** Creating an environment using the environment file

<br>

```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

<br>

> ③ **Troubleshooting 1.** Solving environment: failed. ResolvedPackageNotFound: ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55554431/conda-fails-to-create-environment-from-yml))

>> ○ It seems that using the above conda command in Windows essentially leads to an error.

>> ○ **Method 1.** Execute after removing the build info.

>> ○ **Method 2.** Execute after removing the platform-specific version tag.

⑵ Docker: The most recommended method

⑶ Binder

⑷ `requirements.txt`: You can list packages using commands like `pip list` and `pip freeze`. These packages can be saved to a `requirements.txt` file, which allows for the bulk downloading of packages later using the following command.

> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

⑸ setup.py

> ① The `pip install .` command executes the `setup.py` file located in the current directory (.) to build the package.

> ② The built package is installed in Python's site-packages directory.

> ③ During installation, the `install_requires` field in `setup.py` is referenced to automatically install dependencies.

>> ○ `install_requires`: Defines essential dependencies.

>> ○ `requirements.txt`: Defines additional dependencies for development and testing.

> ④ **Example 1.**

<br>

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="mypackage",
    version="1.0.0",
    install_requires=[
        "numpy>=1.18.0",
        "pandas>=1.1.0",
    ],
)
```

<br>

> ⑤ **Example 2.** `pip install PATH/TO/FILE/allendigger-1.0.tar.gz`

⑹ Sharing an environment through a GitHub repository.

<br>

```python
# Example 

conda create -n CellDART python=3.8  
conda activate CellDART  
pip install git+https://github.com/mexchy1000/CellDART.git  
python -m ipykernel install --user --name CellDART --display-name CellDART
```

<br>

⑺ `README.md`: Simply indicate specifications as plain text.

⑻ To run a `.sh` file, you can do so by using `./[My_File].sh`, `sh [My_File].sh`, or `bash [My_File].sh`.

> `bash ./MyEnvironment.sh`

⑼ `renv`: Dependency management system for R

⑽ `Mamba`

> ① Written in C++ to replace the increasingly heavy conda.

> ② Manager for Anaconda. Can use bioconda channel. Available for Python, R.

> ③ **Step 1.** Create a conda environment, named MyENV 

>> `mamba create --yes --name MyENV --channel bioconda python=3.11`

> ④ **Step 2.** Add the new environment to JupyterLab kernel

>> `~/.conda/envs/MyENV/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user —name=MyENV`

⑾ `SnakeMake`: Python-based pipeline development, and workflow management system.

⑿ `Singularity`: A container like Docker. `.sif` file indicates Singularity container image file. 

> ① Command: `singularity exec myFile.sif original_command [argument1] [argument2] ···`

⒀ `Podman`: A container like Docker
