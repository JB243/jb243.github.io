## **1. Group Theory**

⑴ Axioms

> ① **Closure**: ∀a, b ∈ G, a·b ∈ G

> ② **Associative property**: ∀a, b, c ∈ G, (a·b)·c = a·(b·c)

> ③ **Identity element**: For any a ∈ G, there exists e ∈ G satisfying a·e = e·a = a
> exists

> ④ **Inverse element**: For any a ∈ G, there exists a<sup>-1</sup> such that a·a<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup>·a = e

> > ○ Uniqueness of the inverse: For any two inverses a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup>, a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>, we always have a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup> = a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>

> > ○ a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup> = e·a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup> = (a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>·a)·a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup> = a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>·(a·a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup>) = a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>·e = a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>

> ⑤ **Commutativity**: When the order of the operation does not matter for the group (G, +), i.e., when a·b = b·a

> > ○ Called commutative or Abelian group.

> > ○ If this property does not hold for all elements of a group, the group is called a non-commutative group

> > ○ A finite commutative group can be expressed as a product of cyclic groups(cyclic group)

> ⑥ Invariance: For a function ϕ: X → Y to be G-invariant, for all g ∈ G and x ∈ X, it must satisfy ϕ(x) = ϕ(gx)

> > ○ This means the group action on the input space has no effect on the output

> ⑦ Equivariance: For a function ϕ: X → Y to be G-equivariant, for all g ∈ G and x ∈ X, it must satisfy ϕ(gx) = g'ϕ(x)

> > ○ Here g' ∈ G' is a group that is homomorphic to G and acts on the output space

> > ○ Equivariance means that the group action in the input space induces a corresponding group action in the output space

**Figure 1.** The major algebraic systems

<br>

> ① Set: A collection of elements. No operation/rule

> ② Magma: One operation (\*). For any a, b, a*b is always defined (closed set)

> ③ Semigroup: One operation (\*). Magma + associativity

> ④ Monoid: One operation (\*). Semigroup + existence of identity element e (e\*a = a\*e = a)

> ⑤ Group: One operation (\*). Monoid + every element has an inverse

> > ○ Abelian group: Group + commutativity $a\*b = b\*a$

>>> ○ In the Abelian case, the multiplicative notation $xy$ is often replaced by additive notation $x+y$.

> > ○ Product group: Defined as the Cartesian product $G \times H$ of two groups $G$, $H$ (e.g., ($g_1$, $h_1$))

> > > ○ The new group operation is $(g_1, h_1)\cdot(g_2, h_2) = (g_1g_2, h_1h_2)$

> > ○ Symmetric group of degree $n$: The group of all permutations of $n$ elements. Denoted by $S_n$. Related to the definition of symmetry.

>> ○ The identity element provides a reference point, and inverses guarantee cancellation/solvability, making a group a structure in which computations are possible.

> ⑥ Ring: Two operations +, **·**

> > ○ Definition

> > > ○ (R, +) is an Abelian group

> > > ○ **·** is associative

> > > ○ Distributive laws a(b + c) = ab + ac, (a+b)c = ac + bc

> > ○ Unital ring: A ring with multiplicative identity 1

> > ○ Commutative ring: A ring in which ab = ba holds

> ⑦ Division ring(skew field): Ring + division possible

> > ○ Every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse (multiplication need not be commutative)

> ⑧ Field: Division ring + multiplicative commutativity (i.e., division by any nonzero element + commutative)

> > ○ Subfield: A subset contained in a field that remains a field under the same operations

> > ○ Field extension: When K ⊆ L and both are fields, refers to L / K

> ⑨ Integral domain: Commutative ring(usually with 1) + no zero divisors (ab = 0 ⇒ a = 0 or b = 0)

> ⑩ Module: Something like a vector space where a ring R acts as scalars.

> > ○ Definition: (M, +) is an Abelian group, and scalar multiplication R × M → M satisfies distributive/associative rules

> ⑪ [Vector space](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1897#2-vector-space) (linear space): A module whose scalar ring is a field; i.e., a module over a field

> ⑫ Homogeneous space: A space X such that for any pair x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> ∈ X, there always exists g ∈ G with gx<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>2</sub>

> > ○ A homogeneous space X equipped with an action of G is also called a G-space(G-space)

> ⑬ Algebra: A vector space (or module) over a field (or ring) where multiplication between elements is also defined and is compatible with scalars structure

> > ○ Examples: Matrix algebra, [sigma-algebra](https://jb243.github.io/pages/910#1-sigma-algebra)

> ⑭ Lattice: Two operations (∧, ∨). Has meet/join operations like gcd/lcm, and satisfies commutative/associative/absorption laws

⑶ Mapping

> ① Injective function(one-to-one)

> > ○ A function when, in _f_:  *X* →  *Y* , each element of the codomain is related to exactly one element of the domain

> ② Surjective function(onto)

> > ○ A function whose codomain = image

> ③ Bijective function

> > ○ A function that is both injective and surjective

> ④ Homomorphism

> > ○ Given two groups (G, ·), (H, \*), a map ρ: G → H satisfying ρ(u · v) = ρ(u) \* ρ(v)

> ⑤ Isomorphism

> > ○ A homomorphism satisfying a one-to-one correspondence(bijective)

> ⑥ Automorphism

> ⑦ Group action: A group action is a function T: G × X → X, mapping a pair (g, x) to an element of X

> > ○ Definition: A group (a set of symmetries) acts by permuting solutions (roots) or numbers among each other

> > ○ **Condition 1.** For the identity element e of G, T(e, x) = x

> > ○ **Condition 2.** For g<sub>1</sub>, g<sub>2</sub> ∈ G, T(g<sub>1</sub>, T(g<sub>2</sub>, x)) = T(g<sub>1</sub>g<sub>2</sub>, x)

> > ○ For brevity, we write T(g, x) as Tg(x), and this is expressed as the point x being mapped to gx (= T<sub>g</sub>(x))

> ⑧ Representation

> > ○ A representation of a group G means a map ρ: G → GL(V), the group of linear transformations on a vector space V

> > ○ Homomorphism condition: A representation must additionally satisfy ρ(g<sub>1</sub>g<sub>2</sub>) = ρ(g<sub>1</sub>)ρ(g<sub>2</sub>)

> > ○ In many cases V is ℝ<sup>n</sup> or ℂ<sup>n</sup>

> > ○ Reducible: When a representation can be decomposed into a direct sum of other representations

> > ○ Irreducible: Any representation that is not reducible. The set of irreducible representations is denoted Irr(G), irreps, etc.

> > ○ All irreducible representations of a finite commutative group(finite commutative group) are 1-dimensional and form a bijection with the group itself correspondence(bijection)

> > ○ Irreducible representations of finite commutative groups are classified as products of cyclic groups ℤ/nℤ

> ⑨ Orbit: For a point x ∈ X, the orbit Gx of x is defined as the set {gx: g ∈ G}

> > ○ For example, if G is a translation group and x is an image, the orbit means all translated versions of that image

⑷ **Theorem 1.** Each axiom of a group 〈G, \*〉 is a structural property of 〈G, \*〉

> ① Definition: A structural property of 〈G, \*〉 means a characteristic shared by all binary structures isomorphic to 〈G, *〉

> ② Premise: Via an isomorphism φ: G → S, 〈S, ㆍ〉 is a binary structure isomorphic to 〈G, *〉

> ③ Proof for **Axiom 1**: α, β, γ ∈ S, ∃ a, b, c ∈ G s.t. φ(a) = α, φ(b) = β, φ(c) = γ

## **2. Applications**

⑴ In a regular tetrahedron, because the base is an equilateral triangle, the distances that arise within the base are in the √3 family, and the distances that arise when moving into three dimensions are in the √6 family; this can be proved using group theory.

⑵ [Irrational number symmetry](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2465): For an operation with rational coefficients that yields a + b√c with b ≠ 0, it must also derive a - b√c with b ≠ 0

⑶ [$SO(2)$ action and the Lie algebra generator](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2307)

⑷ [A finite cyclic group(Abelian group) is ultimately expressed in terms of cos or sin expressed.](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2426)

⑸ [Inequality proofs and group theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1143)

⑹ [Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2191)

⑺ Noether’s Theorem

> ① If a physical system (its Lagrangian/action) has a continuous symmetry, a corresponding conserved quantity exists.

> ② It is most naturally formulated for continuous groups (Lie groups).

> ③ Time translation symmetry (ℝ under addition) → conservation of energy.

> ④ Spatial translation symmetry (ℝ³) → conservation of momentum.

> ⑤ Rotational symmetry (SO(3)) → conservation of angular momentum.

> ⑥ Gauge-group symmetry (e.g., U(1), SU(2), SU(3)) → conservation of charge/current (and related conservation laws in field theory).
