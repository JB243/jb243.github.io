| 0               | No reactivity or membranous reactivity in < 10% of tumor cells.                                             | Negative                 |

## **3\. Treatment**

 ⑴ **Method 1.** Surgery

> ① Tumor Resection

>> ○ The criteria are established by Hermanek et al. 15 years ago.

>> ○ R0 resection: microscopically margin-negative resection

>> ○ R1 resection: removal of all macroscopic disease. May contain micropic margin.

>> ○ R2 resection: Gross residual disease containing primary tumor, regional node, macroscopic margin.

 ⑵ **Method 2.** Chemotherapy

⑶ <b>Method 3:</b> Radiotherapy

> ① Principles (the "5 Rs")

>> ○ Repair: Repair of sublethal damage allows normal cells to recover.

>> ○ Redistribution: Cancer cells in S phase are relatively resistant. By delivering radiation in multiple fractions, more cells are irradiated in non-S phases, improving tumor cell kill.

>> ○ Reoxygenation: As some cancer cells die, oxygen influx increases, which raises radiation sensitivity.

>> ○ Repopulation: With repeated irradiation, the proportion of normal cells to cancer cells changes.

>> ○ Radiosensitivity: Sensitivity to radiation therapy varies by cell type and tissue.

> ② <b>Type 1:</b> External Beam Radiotherapy

>> ○ IMRT: The current standard.

>> ○ 3D-CRT: Conforms to the tumor shape but cannot modulate beam intensity.

> ③ <b>Type 2:</b> Brachytherapy

> ④ Adverse effects

>> ○ Crossfire irradiation: A nuclide bound to the target cell also causes adjacent cells to incur radiation damage.

>> ○ Bystander effect: When the target cell undergoes apoptosis, neighboring cells are affected by its apoptotic signaling.

 ⑷ **Method 4.** Immunotherapy

> ① Overview: Immunotherapy is effective in only 12.5% of cancer patients.

> ② <b>Types 1.</b> Cancer vaccine

> ③ <b>1-1.</b> Prophylactic cancer vaccines: HPV vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, etc. Only two are FDA-approved.

>> ○ Voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna): 2017

>>> ○ AAV2-based: expresses the <i>RPE65</i> gene.

>>> ○ <i>RPE65</i> gene: encodes a 65-kDa protein in the human retinal pigment epithelium.

>> ○ Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma): 2019

>>> ○ AAV9-based.

>>> ○ Encodes the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein.

>>> ○ If homozygous for an SMN1 gene mutation, spinal muscular atrophy develops within two years after birth.

> ④ **1-2.** [Sipuleucel-T](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1001294)

>> ○ An example of a therapeutic cancer vaccine

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Extract antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from the patient.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Expose the APCs to the antigen in vitro.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Reinfuse the "trained" APCs back into the patient.

>> ○ Used for the treatment of prostate cancer.

>> ○ <b>Advantage:</b> enables one-to-one personalized therapy.

> ⑤ <b>Type 2.</b> CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapy

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Isolate T cells from the patient's blood.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Introduce an inactive virus to the T cells to make them express an engineered receptor.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Expand the cells until there are millions of cells.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Infuse them into the patient → cancer treatment

>> ○ Works well for hematologic cancers but not as well for solid tumors.

>>> ○ Reason: unlike blood cancers, the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors diminishes CAR-T activity.

>> ○ Currently, there are five FDA-approved CAR-T therapies.

>>> ○ Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah): 2017

>>> ○ Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta): 2017

>>> ○ Brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus): 2020

>>> ○ Lisocabtagene maraleucel (Breyanzi): 2021

>>> ○ Iidecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma): 2021

> ⑥ **Type 3.** Cytokine: IL-2, interferon-alpha, etc.

> ⑦ **Type 4.** ICI (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor), also known as ICB (Immune Checkpoint Blockade)

>> ○ Principle

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/e7dc0691-fd21-498f-ae86-2817c8eb21bc)

**Figure. 11.** The principle of ICI

<br>

>>> ○ PD-1: Expressed in T cells

>>> ○ CTLA-4: Expressed in T cells

>>> ○ PD-L1: Expressed in macrophages or tumor cells

>>> ○ VISTA: Expressed in T cells, TAM (tumor-associated macrophages), dendritic cells, and other immune cells

>>> ○ Siglec: The Siglec family in immune cells binds to sialylated glycans on cancer cells, acting as an immune checkpoint

>>> ○ MYC: Overexpression of MYC is involved in immune suppression

>> ○ **Type 1.** PD-1 inhibitor

>>> ○ nivolumab (Opdivo)

>>> ○ pembrolizumab (Keytruda, approved for TNBC patients)

>>> ○ cemiplimab (Libtayo)

>> ○ **Type 2.** PD-L1 inhibitor

>>> ○ atezolizumab (Tecentriq, approved for TNBC patients)

>>> ○ avelumab (Bavencio)

>>> ○ durvalumab (Imfinzi)

>>> ○ atezolizumab

>> ○ **Type 3.** CTLA-4 inhibitor

>>> ○ ipilimumab (the first ICI discovered)

>> ○ Advantages

>>> ○ Universally applicable regardless of cancer type

>>> ○ Received FDA approval for mutation burden: This universality was a first

>> ○ Disadvantages

>>> ○ Immune-related adverse effect: Can cause autoimmune diseases

>>> ○ Shows a response rate of approximately 20-40%: Attempts targeted therapy using mutation burden and other biomarkers

>>> ○ Ineffective for cold tumors like glioblastoma

>>> ○ Expensive

>>> ○ PD-L1 sensitivity may continuously change during treatment

>> ○ Treatment

>>> ○ Better treated with anti-PD1/L1 therapy than with anti-CTLA-4 therapy → Anti-PD1, anti-PDL1 drugs are dominating

>>> ○ FDA approval condition: Prescribed for solid tumors when specific conditions such as MSI-H (microsatellite instability), MMR (mismatch-repair gene) are met.

 ⑸ **Method 5.** Photodynamic Therapy

> ① PS (Photosensitizer)

> ② Type I Reaction: PS → <sup>1</sup>PS<span>*</span> (singlet state) → <sup>3</sup>PS<span>*</span> (triplet state)

>> ○ 1PS* and 3PS* generate radicals, causing tissue damage

> ③ Type II Reaction: <sup>3</sup>PS<span>*</span> + O<sub>2</sub> → PS + <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub><span>*</span>

>> ○ <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>* (singlet oxygen) causes tissue damage

> ④ Disadvantages

>> ○ Efficiency decreases in hypoxic conditions: due to the type II reaction. Prolonged exposure to low-intensity light can be one workaround.

>> ○ Photosensitizers (PS) are hydrophobic and can be highly toxic: makes parenteral (injection) administration difficult.

>> ○ If PS present in the skin is exposed to sunlight, cutaneous tissues can be damaged.

>> ○ Limited tissue penetration of visible light (and other wavelengths) is problematic.
