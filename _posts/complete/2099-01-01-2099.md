## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ Single Sample

> ① Parametric Test: Single Sample T-Test

> ② Non-Parametric Test: Sign Test, [Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2099)

 ⑵ Two Samples (Paired Samples): Essentially the same as single sample

> ① Parametric Test: Paired Sample T-Test

> ② Non-Parametric Test: Sign Test, [Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2099)

 ⑶ Two Samples (Independent Samples)

> ① Parametric Test: Independent Sample T-Test

> ② Non-Parametric Test: [Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2099)

 ⑷ Analysis of Variance

> ① Parametric Test: [ANOVA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1635)

> ② Non-Parametric Test: [Kruskal-Wallis Test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1688)

 ⑸ Randomness

> ① Non-Parametric Test: Run Test

 ⑹ Correlation Analysis

> ① Pearson Correlation Coefficient

> ② Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient

## **2. Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test**

⑴ Overview

> ① A representative non-parametric test method for testing the median of two samples

> ② A test method using the sum of ranks in a combined sample from two samples

> ③ **Assumption 1.** Data distribution is continuous and independent

> ④ **Assumption 2.** Symmetry assumption about the data distribution

 ⑵ 1<sup>st</sup>. Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis

> ① Null Hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: Δ = 0. That is, the medians of the two populations are the same

> ② Alternative Hypothesis H<sub>1</sub>: Δ ＞ 0 or Δ ＜ 0 or Δ ≠ 0

 ⑶ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Setting the Significance Level

 ⑷ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Calculation of Test Statistic

> ① **3-1.** Combine the data from both samples and assign ranks

> ② **3-2.** Sum the ranks of the group with the smaller sample size

>> ○ If the sample sizes are equal, either can be chosen

>> ○ In the case of data with the same values, assign a representative rank to those data collectively

> ③ **3-3.** Calculate the following

>> ○ n<sub>1</sub>: The sample size of the smaller group. Should be 10 or more

>> ○ n<sub>2</sub>: The sample size of the larger group. Should be 10 or more

>> ○ R: The sum of the ranks of the smaller group

> ④ Also known as Mann-Whitney U statistics or Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test

## **3. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Used for testing the median of a single sample or the difference in medians of two paired samples

> ② A test method that considers not only the sign of the difference but also its relative magnitude

> ③ **Assumption 1.** Data distribution is continuous and independent

> ④ **Assumption 2.** Symmetry assumption about the data distribution

 ⑵ 1<sup>st</sup>. Assumptions

> ① N: Sample size

> ② Since there are N data in each of the two groups, there are a total of 2N data

> ③ Paired Comparison Assumption: x<sub>1,i</sub> and x<sub>2,i</sub> form a pair

> ④ H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub> = 0

> ⑤ H1: μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub> ≠ 0, μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub> ＞ 0, or μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub> ＜ 0

 ⑶ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Calculate | x<sub>1,i</sub> - x<sub>2,i</sub> | and sgn(x<sub>1,i</sub> - x<sub>2,i</sub>)

 ⑷ 3rd. Remove pairs where | x<sub>1,i</sub> - x<sub>2,i</sub> | = 0 and define the new sample size as N*

 ⑸ 4<sup>th</sup>. Rearrange the absolute differences in increasing order and assign ranks

> ① In the case of data with the same values, assign a representative rank to those data collectively

 ⑹ 5<sup>th</sup>. Calculation of Test Statistic

> ① **Method 1.**

<br>

> ② **Method 2.**

>> ○ w<sup>+</sup>: The sum of ranks of the data with positive differences

>> ○ w<sup>-</sup>: The sum of ranks of the data with negative differences

>> ○ w<sub>s</sub> = min(w<sup>+</sup>, w<sup>-</sup>)

>> ○ Calculation of the statistic
