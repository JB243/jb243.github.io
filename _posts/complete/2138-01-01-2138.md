## 3. **Trouble Shootings** 

 ⑴ Using only Command + Shift + 5, audio may not be recorded when you screen-record.

> ① Download BlackHole 16ch (Resolves sound issues): <https://underclub.tistory.com/m/5376>

> ② Configure Audio MIDI Setup → Create Multi-Output Device → Name the Multi-Output Device in English

> ③ Sound in the menu bar → Output: Multi-Output Device → Input: BlackHole 16ch

> ④ Record screen with QuickTime Player: Use BlackHole 16ch for microphone

> ⑤ Setting up Google Meeting

> ⑥ Zoom settings

> ⑦ Uninstall BlackHole: <https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole>

⑵  When converting a PPT to a PDF on Windows, dragging might not work at times. However, on a Mac, converting a PPT to a PDF saves it in a way that allows dragging.

⑶ When you insert a GIF file into PowerPoint, saving it back out as an image can cause an issue where only a single frame is saved. In that case, rename the file extension from `.pptx` to `.rar` and open it with [WinRAR](https://extract.me/) ([ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerpoint/comments/lbf7pj/how_do_i_save_a_gif_thats_already_in_a_powerpoint/)).
