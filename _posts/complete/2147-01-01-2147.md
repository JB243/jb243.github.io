## **1\. Overview**

⑴ macOS, Ubuntu are part of the Linux family.

⑵ If you are not familiar with the Linux environment, use the Terminus program: it is provided for free to students.

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Installation**

⑴ **Method 1.** Ubuntu

> ① Since Ubuntu, etc., originally operate with Linux as the operating system, you can manipulate Linux by turning on the terminal.

⑵ **Method 2.** MacOS

> ① **2-1.** You can remotely access a Linux server using the ssh command in the terminal.

> ② **2-2.** [Install Linux on an M1 MacBook with Parallels](https://cpuu.postype.com/post/9184363).

>> ○ M1 MacBooks use the 64-bit ARM desktop image instead of the AMD64 desktop image.

>> ○ [Ryzen 7 does not support AMD-V enabling](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/which-ryzen-7-supports-amd-v-instruction.3702486/): you may need to use the ARM desktop image.

>> ○ [How to uninstall Parallels on a MacBook](https://it-talktalk.tistory.com/1211).

⑶ **Method 3.** Windows

> ① **3-1.** The methods to access a Linux server are as follows:

>> ○ mobaXterm

>> ○ PowerShell

>> ○ FireZilla

> ② **3-2.** Install Linux on Windows with VMware.

>> ○ Create a virtual environment and install Linux.

>> ○ **Example 1**

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Turn on the PC and press the Del key quickly several times until the BIOS screen appears.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Go to the 'M.I.T.' tab and move to 'Advanced Frequency Settings'.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Move to 'Advanced CPU Core Settings'.

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Switch 'SVM Mode' from 'Disabled' to 'Enabled'.

>> ○ **Example 2**

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Move to the BIOS screen.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Go to the 'Tweaker' tab and move to 'Advanced CPU Settings'.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Switch 'SVM Mode' from 'Disabled' to 'Enabled'.
