## **1\. Overview**

⑴ macOS, Ubuntu are part of the Linux family.

⑵ If you are not familiar with the Linux environment, use the Terminus program: it is provided for free to students.

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Installation**

⑴ **Method 1.** Ubuntu

> ① Since Ubuntu, etc., originally operate with Linux as the operating system, you can manipulate Linux by turning on the terminal.

⑵ **Method 2.** MacOS

> ① **2-1.** You can remotely access a Linux server using the ssh command in the terminal.

> ② **2-2.** [Install Linux on an M1 MacBook with Parallels](https://cpuu.postype.com/post/9184363).

>> ○ M1 MacBooks use the 64-bit ARM desktop image instead of the AMD64 desktop image.

>> ○ [Ryzen 7 does not support AMD-V enabling](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/which-ryzen-7-supports-amd-v-instruction.3702486/): you may need to use the ARM desktop image.

>> ○ **Example 1**

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Turn on the PC and press the Del key quickly several times until the BIOS screen appears.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Go to the 'M.I.T.' tab and move to 'Advanced Frequency Settings'.
