>> ○ Significance of the final formula: It is easy to apply an optimization algorithm and can be extended to classification problems that are not linearly separable by applying a kernel.

>> ○ By introducing the slack variable ξ<sub>i</sub> = 1 - y<sub>i</sub> (**wx**<sub>i</sub> + b), some data points that violate the constraints are allowed.

> ③ Kernels used in SVM

>> ○ Linear Kernel: Basic type of kernel, 1-dimensional and faster than other functions

>> ○ Polynomial Kernel: A generalized formula for linear kernels, less efficient in terms of effectiveness and accuracy

>> ○ Gaussian Kernel: Generally used kernel, used when there is no prior knowledge of data

>> ○ Gaussian RBF Kernel: The most commonly used kernel, typically used for nonlinear data. In the following equation, the vector ℓ represents a landmark (e.g., the center of a data point).

<br>

## **3. Type 2.** K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (K-NN)

 ⑴ Overview

> ① A method to label a given test data point using K nearest training data points

> ② Example: YouTube recommendation system

> ③ Doesn't work well beyond 5 dimensions

 ⑵ **Step 1.** Data Loading and Architecture Design

<br>

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

class NearestNeighbor(object):
    ...


(Xtr, Ytr), (Xte, Yte) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

print(Xtr.shape) # (60000, 28, 28)
print(Ytr.shape) # (60000,)
print(Xte.shape) # (10000, 28, 28)
print(Yte.shape) # (10000,)

Xtr_rows = Xtr.reshape(Xtr.shape[0], 28*28)
Xte_rows = Xte.reshape(Xte.shape[0], 28*28)

print(Xtr_rows.shape) # (60000, 784)
print(Xte_rows.shape) # (10000, 784)

nn = NearestNeighbor()
nn.train(Xtr_rows, Ytr)

Yte_predict = nn.predict(Xte_rows, 'L2')
print ('accuracy: %f' + str(np.mean(Yte_predict == Yte)) )

# L1 : accuracy = 47.29%
# L2 : accuracy = 27.24%
# dot : accuracy = 9.9%
```

<br>

 ⑶ **Step 2.** NN Class Design

<br>

```python
class NearestNeighbor(object):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def train(self, X, Y):
        self.Xtr = X
        self.Ytr = Y

    def predict(self, X, dist_metric='L2'):
        num_test = X.shape[0]
        Ypred = np.zeros(num_test, dtype = self.Ytr.dtype)
        
        for i in range(num_test):
            if dist_metric=='L1': ## L1 distance
                distances = np.sum(np.abs(self.Xtr - X[i, :]), axis = 1) 
            elif dist_metric=='L2': ## L2 distance
                distances = np.sum(np.square(self.Xtr - X[i, :]), axis = 1) 
            elif dist_metric=='dot': ## dot distance
                distances = np.dot(self.Xtr, X[i, :])
            
            min_index = np.argmin(distances)
            Ypred[i] = self.Ytr[min_index]
            
            if i%100 == 0:
                print(i)
        return Ypred
```

> ① The training phase is merely a data storage phase

> ② **Factor 1.** Designing the distance function

>> ○ [Distance Function](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1897)(distance function, metric): Defines distance

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/19d5b52f-4083-4908-8994-e0b958754470)

<br>

>> ○ **1-1.** L1 Distance

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/a7f6fc5d-2649-4e4f-8280-316cc04c0692)

<br>

>> ○ **1-2.** L2 Distance: Euclidean distance using the Pythagorean theorem (standard)

>> ○ **1-3.** p-norm

>> ○ **1-4.** Dot Product

>> ○ **1-5.** [KL Distance (Kullback-Leibler Divergence)](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2145)(Kullback-Leibler divergence)

>> ○ **1-6.** [Other distance functions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/879) 

>> ○ Results from L1 and L2 distances are similar: L1 38.6%, L2 35.4%

> ③ **Factor 2.** 1-NN vs. k-NN

>> ○ The edges of each region become smoother as k increases

>> ○ If k is too small, it is not robust and may respond to outliers or noise when labeling

>> ○ Ambiguous regions appear as k increases

 ⑷ **Step 3.** Hyperparameter Tuning: Try various k values and choose the one that yields the best results

<br>

```python
Xval_rows = Xtr_rows[:1000, :] # take first 1000 for validation
Yval = Ytr[:1000]
Xtr_rows = Xtr_rows[1000:, :] # keep last 59,000 for train
Ytr = Ytr[1000:]

validation_accuracies = []
for k in [1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]:
    nn = NearestNeighbor()
    nn.train(Xtr_rows, Ytr)
    Yval_predict = nn.predict(Xval_rows, k = k)
    acc = np.mean(Yval_predict == Yval)
    print 'accuracy: %f' % (acc,)
    validation_accuracies.append((k, acc))
```

<br>

 ⑸ **Step 4.** Improvement

> ① Drawbacks

>> ○ Using KNN at the pixel level may not result in true similarity, leading to poor performance

>> ○ Test time is very slow

>> ○ Curse of dimensionality: As the dimension increases, the number of data required to maintain the same distance between examples increases geometrically

>>> ○ Too sparse examples among examples can lead to sloppy classification results

> ② Improvements

>> ○ Data Normalization: Normalize data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1

>> ○ Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA, NCA, random projection, etc.

>> ○ Cross-Validation: Computationally expensive, commonly used methods include 3-fold, 5-fold, and 10-fold cross-validation

>> ○ Approximate Nearest Neighbors: Reduces accuracy but improves speed (e.g., FLANN)

> ③ Despite these improvements, KNN is rarely used in practice

> ② Technique of drawing decision trees with decision rules using classification functions for analysis

> ③ The purity of child nodes increases compared to the purity of parent nodes

> ④ Calculation results are directly shown in decision trees

> ⑤ Disadvantage: Predictive errors are significant near the boundary points of separation because continuous variables are treated as discontinuous values

 ⑵ **3-1.** Simple Decision Trees

> ① Overview

>> ○ **Advantage 1.** Good representation for given data

>> ○ **Advantage 2.** Interpretable and fast

>> ○ **Advantage 3.** Easily handles the following data: categorical, mixed data, missing data, multiple classes

>> ○ **Drawback 1.** Potential for overfitting, meaning it is vulnerable to outliers.

>> ○ **Drawback 2.** The tree becomes too deep.

>> ○ Solution: Tree pruning

> ② Terminology

>> ○ Root Node

>> ○ Internal Node (Node): Forms conditional statements for attributes

>> ○ Branching: Splits from internal nodes based on attribute values

>> ○ Leaf Node (Terminal Node, Decision Node): Outputs (class assignment)

> ③ Learning Decision Trees

>> ○ **Condition 1.** Not too big or too small

>> ○ **Condition 2.** Occam's Razor Theory: Simplicity is the best

>> ○ **Condition 3.** Complexity depends on depth

>> ○ Learning the smallest and simplest decision tree is an NP-complete problem (Hyafil & Rivest (1976))

>> ○ Decision trees can be learned greedily using heuristic methods

<br>

```python
### BuildTree (D): Greedy training of a decision tree ###
# Input: A data set D = (X, Y).
# Output: A decision tree.

if LeafCondition(D) then
    fn = FindBestPrediction(D)
else
    jn, tn = FindBestSplid(D)
    DL = {(x(i), y(i)) :  x(i)_(jn) < tn} and
    DR = {(x(i), y(i)) :  x(i)_(jn) ≥ tn}
    leftChild = BuildTree(DL)
    rightChild = BuildTree(DR)
end if
```

<br>

>>> ○ **Step 1.** Score all splits

>>> ○ **Step 2.** Greedily find the condition with the maximum information gain

>>> ○ **Step 3.** Divide the dataset with that condition and recursively perform **Step 1** and **Step 2** in each subtree

>>> ○ **Step 4.** Stopping criteria

```python
## R code

library(rpart)

# Train the decision tree model
model <- rpart(species ~ ., data = x_train, method = "class")

```

<br>

> ⑤ **Application 1:** Pruning

<br>

> ③ **Advantage 1.** Reduces the variance of unstable processes like trees, improving predictability

> ④ **Advantage 2.** Smoothes the boundaries of decision trees

 ⑷ **3-3.** Random Forest

> ① Definition: Utilizes m features randomly selected from each sub-dataset for bagging

>> ○ Example: When learning, randomly select only some features such as city, population, average income, number of newborns, and number of newlyweds among various features

> ② **Feature 1.** De-correlating: Increases individuality of each sub-dataset by using only some features

> ③ **Feature 2.** Unused datasets in each sub-dataset can be used to validate out-of-sample errors

> ④ Performance: Random forest ＞ bagging ＞ decision tree

>> ○ Accuracy: Comparable or higher than Adaboost

>> ○ Robustness: Relatively robust against outliers and noise

>> ○ Speed: Faster than bagging and boosting

>> ○ Simplicity and easy parallelization

>> ○ Currently the best-performing algorithm in classification algorithm research

> ⑤ R Code

<br>

```python
## R code

library(randomForest)

# Train the random forest model
model <- randomForest(species ~ ., data = x_train)

# Predict probabilities
prob_estimates <- predict(model, x_test, type = "prob")
```

**Figure 4.** Structure of a K-D Tree

<br>

> ③ Calculating the Shortest Distance Using a K-D Tree:

>> ○ **Step 1:** Start the search from the root node.

>> ○ **Step 2:** Based on the splitting axis of each partition, choose the child node where the given coordinates (coords) might belong and move down the tree.

>> ○ **Step 3:** Repeat **Step 2** until reaching the leaf node that is most likely to contain the given coordinates.

>> ○ **Step 4:** Calculate the Euclidean distance between the points in the leaf node and the given coords.

>> ○ **Step 5:** Based on the shortest distance found in the leaf node, evaluate whether the parent nodes and sibling nodes could contain closer neighbors. If the sibling node is worth exploring, repeat the distance calculation for that node.

>> ○ **Step 6:** Leverage the spatial partitioning characteristics of the K-D Tree to skip unnecessary nodes (pruning).

> ④ Python code

<br>

```python
from scipy.spatial import cKDTree

# KD-Tree Configuration (based on cluster1)
tree = cKDTree(coords_1)

# For each cluster2 point, the distance from the nearest cluster1 point
distances, _ = tree.query(coords_2)
```

## **5. Type 4.** Base Classifier

⑴ Naïve Bayes classifier

> ① Overview

>> ○ An algorithm that assumes conditional independence between variables in the data.

>> ○ An algorithm that combines prior information about classes with information extracted from data, using Bayes' theorem to classify which class a given data point belongs to.

>> ○ It can be used as a solution for problems in text classification, such as determining which category (e.g., spam, economics, sports, etc.) a document belongs to.

> ② Formalization

>> ○ Premise: There are K classes C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, ···, C<sub>K</sub>.

>> ○ Objective: Given a new sample **x** = (x<sub>1</sub>, ···, x<sub>N</sub>) composed of multiple features, determine which class it belongs to.

<br>

> ③ Limitations

>> ○ Violation of conditional independence: If there are significant correlations between features (e.g., age and history of heart disease), related variables may be multiplied multiple times, leading to an overestimation of their effects.

>> ○ Inability to exclude the influence of irrelevant features.

>> ○ Solution: By using methods such as PCR or [mRMR](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2145#1-information-theory) to discard unnecessary variables and retain only the essential ones, these limitations can be mitigated.
