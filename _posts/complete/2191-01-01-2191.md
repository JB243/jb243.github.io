## 1. Overview

⑴ Fermat's infinite descent

> ① Problem: Prove there is no integer solution to $x^4 + y^4 = z^2$

> ② Proof: Proved by Fermat.

>> For any triple $(x,y,z)$, we may reduce it by cancelling common factors, so we may assume without loss of generality that $\gcd(x,y)=1.$ Assuming $\gcd(x,y)=1$, the three numbers $(x^2,y^2,z)$ are pairwise coprime, hence they form a Pythagorean triple. Therefore, we may write without loss of generality $x^2 = m^2-n^2, y^2=2mn, z=m^2+n^2.$ From this, we see that $y$ is even, so we may assume without loss of generality that $m=2a$ and $n=2b+1.$ Now consider $x^2=m^2-n^2=(m+n)(m-n).$ We have $\gcd(m+n,m-n)=\gcd(m+n,2n)=1 (\because\ \gcd(x,y)=1).$ Hence we can set $m+n=v^2, m-n=w^2.$ Since $v$ and $w$ are odd, each is congruent to $1 \pmod 4.$ Thus $2m=(m+n)+(m-n)\equiv 1+1=2\pmod 4,$ but also $2m\equiv 0\pmod 4,$ which is a contradiction.

⑵ Fermat's right-anged triangle problem: Claimed in letters to Digby and Carcavi

> ① Problem: Equivalent to showing there is no right-anged triangle with rational length sides and area 1.

⑶ Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT)

> ① Problem: Given Fermat equation $x^n + y^n = z^n$, show that there are no solutions $x, y, z ∈ ℤ$ with $xyz ≠ 0$ if $n ≥ 3$.

> ② Proof: To prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, which is difficult, one proves an even more difficult statement about elliptic curves (see below).

> ③ There is an old proof by Fermat for $n = 4$, and Euler proved when $n = 3$.
