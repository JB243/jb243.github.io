## **A. Overview**

§ Unless otherwise stated, it is an explanation of the Ph.D. program, and the master's program is separately indicated separately

<br>

## **1. Background**

#### ⑴ Department selection criteria **:** faculty reputation, faculty reputation, field ranking, specific research field, admission rate, proportion of foreigners, funding status, number of graduates, career after graduation, environment

> ① [https://nglscoalition.org/](https://nglscoalition.org/) **:** You can check the acceptance rate, percentage of foreigners, and number of graduates by program

> ② [https://www.thegradcafe.com/](https://www.thegradcafe.com/) **:** After applying, you can check if there is anyone who is interviewing at the time of waiting

> ③ [https://www.petersons.com/](https://www.petersons.com/) **:** You can know the admission rate.

> ④ [https://climbtheladder.com/](https://climbtheladder.com/) **:** You can check the expected interview questions.

> ⑤ [https://www.reddit.com/](https://www.reddit.com/) **:** One of the largest community sites in the United States, where information about studying abroad is frequently exchanged. The following Excel files are also frequently shared.

> ⑥ New departments have a high acceptance rate, so you can apply strategically.

> ⑦ Please note that some departments do not accept foreigners. In general, many departments prefer American to international.

> ⑧ It is important to have a higher ranking in the field of interest research of you than the overall ranking.

> ⑨ In the case of top schools, there are cases where the admission committee reject the candidate thinking that he or she will get into to a more suitable program.

> ⑩ [NIH funding](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/8HNlwNq-hEyMnbWWkSELzw/projects) situations can be used for school search.

> ⑪ Age is not important in studying abroad, but it is necessary to understand the following.

>> ○ First, students from American universities usually graduate from undergraduate studies and go straight to graduate school.

>> ○ Second, the younger you are, the greater your growth potential.

>> ○ Third, the younger you are, the faster you are to accept a new culture **:** Being amenable in an easier sense.

#### ⑵ **Master vs PhD** 

> ① Master's degree **:** 2 years. Most of them are degree courses that only take classes, and if you use this, it is a little intense as a doctor

>> ○ The total tuition for a two-year full-time master's degree can range from at least 60,000 USD, up to more than 90,000 USD.

>> ○ However, there are many cases where master's tuition is waived. Additionally, there are instances where one can earn an additional $20,000 USD per year by working as an RA, without having to pay tuition.

> ② PhD **:** 5 ~ 6 years. Most students with experience in research apply

> ③ American university graduates **:** Most of them finish their undergraduate studies (typically four years) and go straight to the Ph.D. program. Most of them experience undergraduate research from at least sophomore.

> ④ The result for Master process comes later than the result for Doctoral process.

#### ⑶ University vs Insitute

> ① The insitutes aren't that different from the graduate programs in universities.

> ② General universities are good when you need a university name value, and research institutes are good when you want to focus on research.

> ③ Institute does not have a undergraduate department, so TA is not mandatory, and there are many lifelong scientists, so the proportion of Nobel Prize winners is quite high.

> ④ Institute is one of the ultimate destinations for scientists, so it can make you feel like you've skipped a university course.

> ⑤ The institute generally has little tuition compared to the university.

#### ⑷ Eastern vs Western

> ① Most of the top schools are in East and West, which favor Democrats.

> ② There seems a lot to write on the application page in the east and not much in the west.

> ③ The East is more formal during the interview and the West is more free.

> ④ The climate is definitely better in the west.

#### ⑸ Europe vs USA

> ① In the United States, there is typically no separate doctoral degree (an exception being the DEng) and a combined master's and doctoral program is offered. The master's degree is largely used to enhance the chances of being accepted into a doctoral program.

> ② In Europe, one must have a master's degree to apply for a doctoral program, and openings are available irregularly. The evaluation of applicants tends to be more quantitative (for example, standardized test scores) than qualitative (like Statements of Purpose).

#### ⑹ spring vs fall

> ① Many American universities only offer fall admission for PhD programs.

> ② Even when available in spring, the same university's fall admission typically has more openings.

#### ⑺ Following last year, there is a clear trend not to see GRE again this year

> ① Formal Reason **:** Corona Blue (Reduced academic concentration due to the spread of Corona)

> ② **Hidden Reason 1.** Considering the atmosphere where it is difficult to force the test due to the continuous appearance of corona mutations 

> ③ **Hidden Reason 2.** GRE made a change due to COVID-19 while it was said that it was difficult to evaluate competency

#### ⑻ After the introduction of Toefl MyBestScore, it was observed that the policy was not properly established

> ① As a result, the importance of English grades has decreased somewhat and performance evaluation has become important

<br>

#### ⑼ Factors of Success or Failure in Studying Abroad

> ① The Russian-Ukraine war and the U.S.-China hegemony competition are expected to have a positive impact on Korean students by reducing the number of Chinese students.

> ② Economic downturn may be a factor in boosting graduate student inflows, and competition may increase slightly **:** The recession has progressed within a year, so it may not be relevant right now.

> ③ As the Democratic Party of Korea won the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, the situation for foreign students' entrance examinations has improved relatively.

> ④ How does the president's approval rating affect the success or failure of studying abroad?

> ⑤ Increasing number of graduate applicants **:** Related to job market instability. However, this will be more remarkable in the next round than in the current round.

>> ○ **Example 2.** Stanford Biomedical Informatics PhD program

>>> "This year we received a record-breaking number of excellent applications."

> ⑥ There is a possibility that some students who failed to study abroad due to the COVID-19 Pandemic may have tried again, this year. 

> ⑦ **Conclusion :** Considering the above various factors, the opportunity to study abroad seems to be more difficult this year.

#### ⑽ The results in 2023 fall admission cycle seem to be coming out later than usual.

> ① **Reason 1.** **:** As COVID-19 situation was released, interview invitations were activated.

> ② **Reason 2.** **:** In the case of universities in California, the process is delayed due to strikes this year.

#### ⑾ **Early admission** 

> ① Early decision **:** The early admission with binding; only one place can be inserted; early decision can be supported with a number of early actions

> ② Early action **:** The early admission without binding; Multiple admissions can be supported at the same time

> ③ Restricted early action **:** a restricted early admission; early decision and concurrent support are not possible; only in Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Princeton

#### ⑿ **Rolling basis** 

> ① Receiving applications in order of arrival and closing applications when all the good students are here

> ② [Examples of a rolling basis](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/top-national-universities-with-rolling-admissions) 

> ③ This typically applies to undergraduate applications and is not very relevant for doctoral programs.

> ④ Some doctoral programs have two deadlines, such as December 1st and January 15th. In these cases, submitting by the first deadline is associated with a higher acceptance rate.

#### ⒀ **Rotation** 

> ① Looking back at several labs (average of three) in the first year of admission, choosing later which lab to perform the degree

> ② Most life science PhD programs adopt rotation

#### ⒁ **Umbrella program** 

> ① There is a factor that increases the rate of foreigners' acceptance due to the large number of students and the lack of funding

> ② For example, Harvard University's BBS Proglemam has about 300 labs in partnership
