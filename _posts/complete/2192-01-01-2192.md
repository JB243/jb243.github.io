## **A. Overview**

§ Unless otherwise stated, it is an explanation of the Ph.D. program, and the master's program is separately indicated separately

<br>

## **1. Background**

#### ⑴ Department selection criteria: faculty reputation, faculty reputation, field ranking, specific research field, admission rate, proportion of foreigners, funding status, number of graduates, career after graduation, environment

> ① [https://nglscoalition.org/](https://nglscoalition.org/): You can check the acceptance rate, percentage of foreigners, and number of graduates by program

> ② [https://www.thegradcafe.com/](https://www.thegradcafe.com/): After applying, you can check if there is anyone who is interviewing at the time of waiting

> ③ [https://www.petersons.com/](https://www.petersons.com/): You can know the admission rate.

> ④ [https://climbtheladder.com/](https://climbtheladder.com/): You can check the expected interview questions.

> ⑤ [https://www.reddit.com/](https://www.reddit.com/): One of the largest community sites in the United States, where information about studying abroad is frequently exchanged. The following Excel files are also frequently shared.

> ⑥ New departments have a high acceptance rate, so you can apply strategically.

> ⑦ Please note that some departments do not accept foreigners. In general, many departments prefer American to international.

> ⑧ It is important to have a higher ranking in the field of interest research of you than the overall ranking.

> ⑨ In the case of top schools, there are cases where the admission committee reject the candidate thinking that he or she will get into to a more suitable program.

> ⑩ [NIH funding](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/8HNlwNq-hEyMnbWWkSELzw/projects) situations can be used for school search.

> ⑪ ChatGPT can be used for school research.

> ⑫ Age is not important in studying abroad, but it is necessary to understand the following.

>> ○ First, students from American universities usually graduate from undergraduate studies and go straight to graduate school.

>> ○ Second, the younger you are, the greater your growth potential.

>> ○ Third, the younger you are, the faster you are to accept a new culture: Being amenable in an easier sense.

#### ⑵ **Master vs PhD** 

> ① Master's degree: 2 years. Most of them are degree courses that only take classes, and if you use this, it is a little intense as a doctor

>> ○ The total tuition for a two-year full-time master's degree can range from at least 60,000 USD, up to more than 90,000 USD.

>> ○ However, there are many cases where master's tuition is waived. Additionally, there are instances where one can earn an additional $20,000 USD per year by working as an RA, without having to pay tuition.

> ② PhD: 5 ~ 6 years. Most students with experience in research apply

> ③ American university graduates: Most of them finish their undergraduate studies (typically four years) and go straight to the Ph.D. program. Most of them experience undergraduate research from at least sophomore.

> ④ The result for Master process comes later than the result for Doctoral process.

> ⑤ In U.S. doctoral programs, there are many opportunities to transfer from a master's to a doctoral program (provided that the PI can fund the student), so considering applying solely for the master's program is recommended. It is also possible to transfer to a doctoral program after just one year in a master's program, but in such cases, the master's degree is not awarded.

#### ⑶ University vs Insitute

> ① The insitutes aren't that different from the graduate programs in universities.

> ② General universities are good when you need a university name value, and research institutes are good when you want to focus on research.

> ③ Institute does not have a undergraduate department, so TA is not mandatory, and there are many lifelong scientists, so the proportion of Nobel Prize winners is quite high.

> ④ Institute is one of the ultimate destinations for scientists, so it can make you feel like you've skipped a university course.

> ⑤ The institute generally has little tuition compared to the university.

#### ⑷ Eastern vs Western

> ① Most of the top schools are in East and West, which favor Democrats.

> ② There seems a lot to write on the application page in the east and not much in the west.

> ③ The East is more formal during the interview and the West is more free.

> ④ The climate is definitely better in the west.

#### ⑸ Europe vs USA

> ① In the United States, there is typically no separate doctoral degree (an exception being the DEng) and a combined master's and doctoral program is offered. The master's degree is largely used to enhance the chances of being accepted into a doctoral program.

> ② In Europe, one must have a master's degree to apply for a doctoral program, and openings are available irregularly. The evaluation of applicants tends to be more quantitative (for example, standardized test scores) than qualitative (like Statements of Purpose).

#### ⑹ spring vs fall

> ① Many American universities only offer fall admission for PhD programs.

> ② Even when available in spring, the same university's fall admission typically has more openings.

#### ⑺ Following last year, there is a clear trend not to see GRE again this year

> ① Formal Reason: Corona Blue (Reduced academic concentration due to the spread of Corona)

> ② **Hidden Reason 1.** Considering the atmosphere where it is difficult to force the test due to the continuous appearance of corona mutations 

> ③ **Hidden Reason 2.** GRE made a change due to COVID-19 while it was said that it was difficult to evaluate competency

#### ⑻ After the introduction of Toefl MyBestScore, it was observed that the policy was not properly established

> ① As a result, the importance of English grades has decreased somewhat and performance evaluation has become important

</center>
<br>

#### ⑼ Factors of Success or Failure in Studying Abroad

> ① The Russian-Ukraine war and the U.S.-China hegemony competition are expected to have a positive impact on Korean students by reducing the number of Chinese students.

> ② Economic downturn may be a factor in boosting graduate student inflows, and competition may increase slightly: The recession has progressed within a year, so it may not be relevant right now.

> ③ As the Democratic Party of Korea won the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, the situation for foreign students' entrance examinations has improved relatively.

> ④ How does the president's approval rating affect the success or failure of studying abroad?

> ⑤ Increasing number of graduate applicants: Related to job market instability. However, this will be more remarkable in the next round than in the current round.

>> ○ **Example 2.** Stanford Biomedical Informatics PhD program

>>> "This year we received a record-breaking number of excellent applications."

> ⑥ There is a possibility that some students who failed to study abroad due to the COVID-19 Pandemic may have tried again, this year. 

> ⑦ **Conclusion :** Considering the above various factors, the opportunity to study abroad seems to be more difficult this year.

#### ⑽ The results in 2023 fall admission cycle seem to be coming out later than usual.

> ① **Reason 1.**: As COVID-19 situation was released, interview invitations were activated.

> ② **Reason 2.**: In the case of universities in California, the process is delayed due to strikes this year.

#### ⑾ **Early admission** 

> ① Early decision: The early admission with binding; only one place can be inserted; early decision can be supported with a number of early actions

> ② Early action: The early admission without binding; Multiple admissions can be supported at the same time

> ③ Restricted early action: a restricted early admission; early decision and concurrent support are not possible; only in Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Princeton

#### ⑿ **Rolling basis** 

> ① Receiving applications in order of arrival and closing applications when all the good students are here

> ② [Examples of a rolling basis](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/top-national-universities-with-rolling-admissions) 

> ③ This typically applies to undergraduate applications and is not very relevant for doctoral programs.

> ④ Some doctoral programs have two deadlines, such as December 1st and January 15th. In these cases, submitting by the first deadline is associated with a higher acceptance rate.

#### ⒀ **Rotation** 

> ① Looking back at several labs (average of three) in the first year of admission, choosing later which lab to perform the degree

> ② Most life science PhD programs adopt rotation

#### ⒁ **Umbrella program** 

> ① There is a factor that increases the rate of foreigners' acceptance due to the large number of students and the lack of funding

> ② For example, Harvard University's BBS Proglemam has about 300 labs in partnership

<br>

## **2.** [**Stanford**](https://applygrad.stanford.edu/account/)(Stanford University) ('3)

> ⑴ **Overview :** Until the end of World War II, the university was on the verge of bankruptcy, but the IT revolution in Silicon Valley made the Stanford a global university. One of the top engineering universities. Bioinformatics research centered on life science independent of hospitals stands out. [Admission rate of 5.2%](https://www.google.com/search?q=Stanford+PhD+admission+rate). The Korean acquaintances of mine who got accepted to Stanford for a PhD (two in Immunology, one in Bioengineering) all had urgent interviews in February and eventually got accepted. It seems like the top schools may offer interviews later, possibly due to rolling admissions.

> ⑵ **Department**: [https://applygrad.stanford.edu/portal/programs](https://applygrad.stanford.edu/portal/programs) (Renewed in mid-September every year); Only one program is allowed except for two programs when applying for [Biosciences PhD programs](https://biosciences.stanford.edu/)

> ⑾ Biosciences: You can apply for both master's and doctoral programs simultaneously. However, applying for a master's degree along with a doctoral program is considered a lower priority than applying solely for a master's, resulting in a lower acceptance rate. In U.S. doctoral programs, there are many opportunities to transfer from a master's to a doctoral program (provided that the PI can fund the student), so it is recommended to consider applying only for the master's program.
