<br>

<br>

## **Step 2. Visa**

⑴ [Types of Visas](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2244)

⑵ **Application Method 1:** Interview at the embassy followed by visa issuance 

> ① **Step 1.** Obtain an [I-20 form](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2194) from your study abroad school.

> ② **Step 2.** I-901 SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) payment.

> ③ **Step 3.** Visa interview

> ④ **Step 4.** [Visa issuance check](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx): You can also check the issuance status within +1 to +3 days after the interview.

> ⑤ **Step 5.** Visa issuance ([ref](https://ilyanglogis.co.kr/)): You can receive your passport with the visa attached one week after the interview.

> ⑥ If you have a National Institute for International Education (NIIED) English Financial Guarantee Certificate, it becomes easier to obtain a visa.

> ⑦ Students with full funding can easily obtain a visa.

⑶ **Application Method 2:** Expedited application by submitting documents and reserving a date after application.

> ① If you request expedited processing for a US visa, interview waiver may not be granted.

⑷ **Application Method 3:** Travel Visa

> ① Agency: [CIBT Visas](https://cibtvisas.com/) (website for US citizens).

⑸ **Application Method 4:** [ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)(Electronic System for Travel Authorization): Visa Waiver Program (short-term visa-free entry program, VWP).

> ① Overview

<br>

<br>

## **Step 3. Flights and Accommodation**

⑴ Airplane Ticket

> ① Search on [CheapOair (OneTravel)](https://www.onetravel.com/), [Naver Flights](https://flight.naver.com/), airline websites, Interpark, or [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.co.kr/), etc.

> ② Consider travel management services like [Corporate Traveler](https://www.corporatetraveler.us/en-us).

> ③ You can often purchase discounted tickets through airline websites.

> ④ TSA PreCheck: Part of the Trusted Traveler program, allowing expedited security screening for domestic travel in the US.

> ⑤ Be cautious when making connections at different airports.

> ⑥ Ways to Solve Ear Pain During Landing: Ear pain occurs when the external pressure becomes higher than the internal pressure upon landing, causing discomfort around the eardrum.

>> ○ **Priority 1.** Yawning: Yawning opens the Eustachian tube, balancing the pressure in front of and behind the eardrum. Even without yawning, merely opening the mouth wide can open the Eustachian tube. Additionally, opening the mouth wide as if yawning can induce yawning.

>> ○ **Priority 2.** Swallowing

>> ○ **Priority 3.** Pinching the nose and trying to blow through it to apply pressure to the ears: This does not require much force; a slight opening in the eardrum allows the pressure to balance slowly. Overdoing it can harm the ears, so it should not be done excessively.

>> ○ **Priority 4.** Belching silently

>> ○ **Priority 5.** Special Earplugs: I have heard that they are sold in Japan, but I have not personally seen them.

⑵ Accommodation

> ① Search on [Expedia](https://www.expedia.co.kr/en/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.kr/?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1673794696_Yjc5ZWM2MWJhNDIy), etc.

<br>

<br>

## **Step 4. Credit Cards**

> ① In the case of a hotel, there may be a safety deposit (e.g., New York City), so you must have a card in your name

> ② Cash

>> ○ **Purpose 1.** Emergency funds for taxi fares, medical expenses, emergency medicine, etc.

>> ○ **Purpose 2.** Tips (usually 10-20% of the service price).

> ③ Termination of domestic telecommunications companies and activation of mobile virtual network operator ([MVNO](https://www.epost.go.kr/comm.alddlord.RetrieveChargeList.comm?phonepaydivcd=N))

>> ○ If you have an unlocked phone, choosing the 4th mobile carrier (MVNO) can also be a reasonable option.

> ② The time display is adjusted to reflect the local time: set to Korean time upon arrival overseas, and back to Korean time when departing from abroad.

> ③ Mobile phone roaming can be easily set up at the service centers of each carrier located within the airport.
  
⑶ **Method 3.** Having both a South Korean and a U.S. phone number

> ① U-SIM can also be used by changing the USIM by country (ref)

> ② Recent smartphones use e-SIMs, allowing two e-SIMs to be used in one phone for different countries.

> ③ For dual-SIM phones like this, domestic phones often do not support this feature. It is usually only available on the same model purchased through international retailers. Therefore, purchasing from overseas is recommended.

> ④ An e-SIM can be obtained even a week before departure without any issues, and it costs about 40,000 won.

> ⑤ It is recommended to change the Korean plan to an affordable plan (e.g., 11,000 won plan) when departing for the United States.
