## **Step 1. Passport**

> ② Pick it up in person or have it delivered to your home (additional fee of about 5,000 KRW).

> ③ Old version passports will become invalid from 2028, so it is recommended to get the new version if possible.

**Figure. 1.** Passport Usage Guidelines

<br>

> ① It is recommended that the remaining validity period of your passport is at least 6 months from your departure date.

> ② It should have at least one blank page.

> ③ You must sign your passport.

> ④ If you frequently lose your passport, the validity period for reissuance will be restricted based on the number of losses and duration.

> ⑤ If you use a passport without a resident registration number as an identification, you must obtain a Passport Information Certificate.

<br>

<br>

## **Step 2. Visa**

⑴ [Types of Visas](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2244)

⑵ **Application Method 1:** Interview at the embassy followed by visa issuance (interview and issuance within +1 to +3 days, it seems).

> ① **Step 1.** Obtain an [I-20 form](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2194) from your study abroad school.

> ② **Step 2.** I-901 SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) payment.

> ③ **Step 3.** Visa interview.

> ④ **Step 4.** Visa issuance ([ref](https://ilyanglogis.co.kr/)).

> ⑤ If you have a National Institute for International Education (NIIED) English Financial Guarantee Certificate, it becomes easier to obtain a visa.

⑶ **Application Method 2:** Expedited application by submitting documents and reserving a date after application.

> ① If you request expedited processing for a US visa, interview waiver may not be granted.

⑷ **Application Method 3:** Travel Visa

> ① Agency: [CIBT Visas](https://cibtvisas.com/) (website for US citizens).

⑸ **Application Method 4:** [ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)(Electronic System for Travel Authorization): Visa Waiver Program (short-term visa-free entry program, VWP).

> ① Overview

>> ○ An online application system developed by the US government.

>> ○ After a simple travel permit application is approved, you can enter the US.

> ② Requirements

**Figure. 2.** Countries covered by Visa Waivers

<br>

> ③ Procedures

>> ○ Usually takes 1 day, but can take up to 3 days.

>> ○ You need to scan and upload your passport when applying.

>> ○ [Application Guide](https://www.estaform.org/application)

>> ○ No limit on the number of entries to the US.

>> ○ It doesn't guarantee entry into the US, but allows boarding flights for US travel.

<br>

<br>

## **Step 3. Flights and Accommodation**

⑴ Airplane Ticket

> ① Search on [CheapOair (OneTravel)](https://www.onetravel.com/), [Naver Flights](https://flight.naver.com/), airline websites, Interpark, or [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.co.kr/), etc.

> ② Consider travel management services like [Corporate Traveler](https://www.corporatetraveler.us/en-us).

> ③ You can often purchase discounted tickets through airline websites.

> ④ TSA PreCheck: Part of the Trusted Traveler program, allowing expedited security screening for domestic travel in the US.

> ⑤ Be cautious when making connections at different airports.

> ⑥ Ways to Solve Ear Pain During Landing: Ear pain occurs when the external pressure becomes higher than the internal pressure upon landing, causing discomfort around the eardrum.

>> ○ **Priority 1.** Yawning: Yawning opens the Eustachian tube, balancing the pressure in front of and behind the eardrum. Even without yawning, merely opening the mouth wide can open the Eustachian tube. Additionally, opening the mouth wide as if yawning can induce yawning.

>> ○ **Priority 2.** Swallowing

>> ○ **Priority 3.** Pinching the nose and trying to blow through it to apply pressure to the ears: This does not require much force; a slight opening in the eardrum allows the pressure to balance slowly. Overdoing it can harm the ears, so it should not be done excessively.

>> ○ **Priority 4.** Belching silently

>> ○ **Priority 5.** Special Earplugs: I have heard that they are sold in Japan, but I have not personally seen them.

⑵ Accommodation

> ① Search on [Expedia](https://www.expedia.co.kr/en/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.kr/?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1673794696_Yjc5ZWM2MWJhNDIy), etc.

<br>

<br>

## **Step 4. Credit Cards**

> ① In the case of a hotel, there may be a safety deposit (e.g., New York City), so you must have a card in your name

> ② Cash

>> ○ **Purpose 1.** Emergency funds for taxi fares, medical expenses, emergency medicine, etc.

>> ○ **Purpose 2.** Tips (usually 10-20% of the service price).

>> ○ Approximately $200-300 for a 3-4 day stay.

⑵ Examples

> ① VISA, Mastercard among Korean cards: There may be an overseas remittance fee

## **Step 9. Insurance**

⑴ Generally, the insurance provided by the school after studying abroad is sufficient.

> ① Some schools require you to have their insurance to receive TA or RA-related benefits.

⑵ Consider separate insurance for drivers and travelers.

<br>

<br>

## **Step 10. School-related Procedures**

⑴ **Step 1.** Register your official school email.

⑵ **Step 2.** Admission Letter (I-20; International F-1)
  
> ① The admission letter sent by the school you were accepted to.

> ② It takes about 3-4 weeks after submitting the relevant documents.

> ③ You need an I-20 form to apply for the F-1 non-immigrant student visa, which is commonly applied for by international students.

> ② Pay the SEVIS I-901 Fee: This fee, which must be paid before applying for a visa, is required once entered into the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).

> ③ Apply for a visa through the U.S. Embassy: Follow the U.S. Embassy procedures to complete and submit the [DS-160](https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/) online visa application form, and print and save the received information.

> ④ Schedule an interview at the U.S. Embassy: Nearly all countries require an interview before officially approving a U.S. visa.

>> ○ [Interview application guidance site](https://ustraveldocs.com/kr/ko/step-4/) and [application site](https://www.usvisascheduling.com/).

> ⑤ Visa interview: The following are reasons why a U.S. visa might not be issued after the visa interview:

>> ○ If the applicant is from a country banned by the U.S. from visa issuance: Not applicable to South Korea.

>> ○ If the applicant fails to sincerely prove financial stability.

>> ○ If the applicant states intentions to stay in the U.S. indefinitely: At the current time, visa extension is not possible.

> ⑥ After visa approval: Once the U.S. visa is approved, you can travel to the U.S. within 30 days before the start date of the program.

> ⑦ Upon arrival, you must present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 to receive approval from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to enter the United States.

> ③ Troubleshooting: "Please provide the expanded version of the same form showing the dates you received each dose."

>> ○  MMR vaccine: If the antibody test result is negative, adults can receive additional doses.

>> ○  Polio vaccine: Adults cannot receive this vaccine.

>> ○  Computer records of vaccination may not exist before 2002.
