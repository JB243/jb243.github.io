## 6. After Graduation 

⑴ Overview

> ① In general, the abandonment rate of U.S. graduate students is 31.7%.

>> ○ The rate of abandonment of Korean Government-funded graduate students is 1.5%.

> ② In general, about 3.0% of Ph.D. graduates are employed as professors.

>> ○ 61.1% of Korean Government-funded Ph.D. graduates are employed as professors.

⑵ An assistant professor at a prestigious university in the United States.

> ① The appointment of an American professor 

>> ○ Networking is more important than journal listing to be hired by American universities.

>> ○ Therefore, American universities have less pressure on the number of journal entries.

> ② 9 months wage: $85,000 (pay is disclosed in real name)

> ③ 25% deducted by income tax: $5312 divided by 12

> ④ Housing insurance, auto insurance, medical insurance, $4,500

> ⑤ $3,500 for telecommunications, TV reception, internet, electricity, water, etc.

> ⑥ Two vehicles (about $500 a month for car lease)

> ⑦ House loan of 200 million dollars: $1500

> ⑧ American professors don't have a retirement age, but they usually work until the age of 65 and retire.

>> ○ Reason: Because I get a lot of pension (approximately $80,500)

>> ○ However, professors who are active in research do not retire according to their age.

>> ○ In the case of 1. Annual pension receipt = Total wage during working period * 1.8%

>> ○ In the case of 2. Annual pension = Average of the highest annual salary of 5 years * (1.8% * working period)

>> ○ The total amount of pension is less than that of office workers who have worked for a long time.

⑶ Industry in the United States

> ① Wages: $130,000

> ② 30% tax deduction

> ③ When completing Ph.D., most graduates get jobs at large corporations.

> ④ Corporate Internship

>> ○ Conducted from the second year of master's or doctoral studies: Doctoral students often do this after completing their qualifying exams.

>> ○ The internship is conducted during the summer break period from May to August.

> ⑤ The field of life science 

>> ○ Industries also require Podak: Some require re-entry interviews to promote.

>> ○ If I did Podak, I would be in the same position as PI in Industries.

>> ○ If I were a doctor, I would be a research scientist

> ⑥ Job/Post-doc/Faculty Posting Examples

>> ○ [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/about/careers/job/4907567) 

>> ○ [CancerCareers.org](https://www.cancercareers.org/) 

>> ○ [Stellenangebote de ETH Zürich](https://jobs.ethz.ch/site/index)

>> ○ [ETH get hired](https://eth-gethired.ch/de/jobs/)

>> ○ [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en/om/work-at-kth/lediga-jobb)

⑷ Professor in Korea

> ① Impact factor is more important than the number of papers.

> ② One paper published in a good journal is equivalent to several other small papers.

> ③ In the field of engineering or computer science, papers are published quickly, so a certain number of papers need to be filled.

⑸ U.S. officials: NIH, US FDA, DARPA, ···

⑹ International organization: WHO, UN, ···

⑺ Teaching-oriented school

⑻ Startup: Some people start a business with their advisors or colleagues.
