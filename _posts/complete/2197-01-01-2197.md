## **1. Overview**

⑴ Pharmacology **:** Biochemistry that studies drugs and the body's response to their administration.

⑵ Differences between Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics

> ① Pharmacodynamics **:** Related to receptors, ion channels, enzymes, immune system, etc.

> ② Pharmacokinetics **:** Related to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.

>> ○ The four aspects above are collectively referred to as ADME.

<br>

<br>

## **2. Pharmacodynamics** (PD)

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition **:** Related to receptors, ion channels, enzymes, immune system, etc.

> ② Tests on pharmacodynamics are mainly conducted in Phase 1 clinical trials to observe enzyme inhibitors or drug activity.

⑵ **Constant 1.** Ki (inhibition constant)

> ① [Michaelis-Menten Equation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1350)

> ② [Inhibitors and Reaction Kinetics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1350#:-,,-\(Inhibitor\))

⑶ **Constant 2.** Kd (dissociation constant)

> ① Definition **:** The equilibrium constant for dissociation reactions; the larger the Kd, the more dissociation occurs.

> ② Kd is more commonly used than Ki because it can be easily determined through graphs.

> ③ Relationship formula

## **3. Pharmacokinetics** (PK)

⑴ Definition **:** Related to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.

> ① These four aspects are collectively referred to as ADME.

> ② Also called ADMET in addition to toxicity.

> ③ PK parameters:

>> ○ Bioavailability F (%) = Systemic circulation dose (mg) / Administered dose (mg) × 100.

>> ○ Absorption rate constant ka (/hr) = Systemic circulation rate (mg/hr) / Residual amount at absorption site (mg).

>> ○ Volume of distribution Vd (L) = Amount in body (mg) / Plasma concentration (mg/L).

>> ○ Clearance CL (L/hr) = Elimination rate (mg/hr) / Plasma concentration (mg/L).

⑵ **Model 1.** Monoexponential Model

> ① Graph **:** Corresponds to the [first-order reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1350#:-,1,-) in reaction kinetics.

> ② Steady state through chronic dosing.

>> ○ It takes approximately five half-lives to reach steady state.

> ② Explanation of each phase:

>> ○ **Phase 1.** Absorption phase.

>>> ○ Oxidation, reduction occur to activate the drug upon initial intake.

>>> ○ Sulfation, glucuronidation, acetylation occur to inactivate the drug for excretion.

>> ○ **Phase 2.** Postabsorption phase (distribution phase).

>> ○ **Phase 3.** Elimination phase.

>> ○ Cmax, tmax (time at Cmax).

> ③ ABC (accelerated blood clearance).

>> ○ Definition **:** A phenomenon where drugs are rapidly excreted initially, followed by slower excretion.

>> ○ [IgM antibody](https://jb243.github.io/pages/86#:-,IgM,-) is known to be involved in the ABC phenomenon of nanodrugs.

⑷ Pharmacokinetic experiments.

> ① If not completely excreted through urine, it can be interpreted as accumulating in the body.

> ② If not largely converted into metabolites, it can be interpreted as low bioavailability.

> ③ If AUCs of oral and IV administration are nearly identical, it can be interpreted as high absorption and hydrophilicity.

> ④ In oncology research, a tumor-to-liver ratio of 0.5 or higher indicates good pharmacokinetic properties.
