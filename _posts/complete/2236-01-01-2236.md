※ The PhD program in Switzerland is comparable in ranking to UK universities, but with a shorter duration and almost no tuition fees. Plus, you can earn a salary comparable to that of a large corporation, making it worth considering.

※ The following article is based on my experience of reaching the final stage of LSZGS admission.
 
※ The next deadline for LSZGS application is Nov 1st, 2023 and May 1st, 2024 (CEST).

## **1. Overview**

⑴ [Based on the 2022 global rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2022), ETH Zurich ranks 8th, and the University of Zurich (UZH) ranks 70th.

> ① As a reference, Seoul National University ranks 36th: (Note) Seoul National University is perceived to be ranked around 80th to 90th by the English-speaking world. However, I believe this perception will gradually improve due to the university's active collaboration with international research teams.

> ② As a reference, Einstein left ETH Zurich with an undergraduate degree and obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Zurich.

⑵ The number of Korean students admitted to the Ph.D. programs at ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich is very low, ranging from 0 to 4 students per year.
