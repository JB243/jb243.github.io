## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Visa

> ① A visa is merely a travel document, while the I-94 serves as the document indicating one's status.

> ② There are instances where individuals remain in the U.S. illegally by not leaving the country even after their visa has expired.

⑵ Permanent Residency (Green Card): It is recommended to obtain permanent residency before Trump takes office.

> ① Procedure

>> ○ **Method 1:** Consulting with a law firm 

>> ○ **Method 2:** There is a procedure to obtain a U.S. green card by obtaining a Ph.D.: There is a cheaper way to get a green card other than through a law firm.

>> ○ To acquire a U.S. green card, it is necessary to hire a lawyer and costs more than 5,000 USD, along with a requirement of residing in the U.S. continuously for over a year.

> ② **Type 1.** Employment-Based Green Card

>> ○ When obtaining a green card through Employment-Based Preferences 1 (EB-1) to 3 (EB-3): The period of unlawful presence must be less than 180 days until the submission of I-485.

>> ○ For Employment-Based Preferences 2 (EB-2) and 3 (EB-3), which also require the labor certification process, it takes about one year for the labor certification to be approved.

>> ○ It is important to maintain another valid immigration status until pursuing an employment-based immigration process.

> ③ **Type 2.** EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW)

>> ○ The EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) has less stringent qualification requirements compared to the top-tier EB-1.

>> ○ The EB-2 NIW does not require the labor certification process or a sponsor.

>> ○ Except for individuals born in China and India, the priority date is current, allowing the concurrent filing of I-140 and I-485, which is a significant advantage.

> ④ Advantages

>> ○ Right to Long-Term Residence and Employment: Employment opportunities available even without an H-1 or O-1 visa.

>> ○ Ability to Sponsor Spouse and Unmarried Children: Eligible to invite spouse and unmarried children. A spouse has the freedom to pursue employment opportunities once they receive an EAD (Employment Authorization Document).

>> ○ Social Security Benefits: Eligible for social security benefits.

>> ○ Eligibility for Citizenship: Must meet the residency requirement of living with a green card for a specified period.

>> ○ Exam Eligibility: Eligible to take exams such as the U.S. CPA (Certified Public Accountant), U.S. Patent Attorney, and U.S. Real Estate Agent exams.

>>> ○ **Exception 1.** ASA (Associate of the Society of Actuaries), FSA (Fellow of the Society of Actuaries): No permanent residency required.

>>> ○ **Exception 2.** U.S. Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) Certification: Sufficient to pursue related graduate studies, followed by exams and training.

>>> ○ **Exception 3.** CFA

>>> ○ **Exception 4.** ACCA

>> ○ Advantages as a Graduate Student: Increased opportunities for various fellowships and lower costs for professors to fund graduate students with permanent residency.

>>> ○ Example: The tuition for fall and winter terms combined (i.e., total annual tuition cost) will range from $28,508 to $35,810 for resident students and $53,586 to $63,122 for non-residents.

> ⑤ Disadvantages

>> ○ Continuous Residence Requirement: If you leave the United States for more than one year, it may be considered that you lack the intention to immigrate, and your permanent residency could be revoked. 

>>> ○ You can maintain your permanent residency by traveling to Guam or other nearby U.S. territories once a year.

>> ○ Tax Obligations: Permanent residents must pay U.S. taxes on their worldwide income and may be subject to dual taxation in both Korea and the United States.

>> ○ Differences from U.S. Citizens: No right to vote and ineligible to apply for jobs requiring high-security clearance.

⑶ Citizenship (citizenship)

> ① The requirements for obtaining citizenship are standardized.

>> ○ **Example 1:** After obtaining permanent residency, one must work for a certain period, etc.

>> ○ **Example 2:** In the case of marriage to a U.S. citizen: You must maintain the marriage for 2-3 years until final approval is received from the U.S. government.

> ② Article 15 of the Nationality Act: If a citizen voluntarily acquires a foreign nationality (e.g., U.S. citizenship), they immediately lose their South Korean nationality.

>> ○ Supplementary Information: South Korea does not allow dual nationality unless you are over 65 or originally a U.S. citizen.

>>> ○ Initially, this applied only to men due to military obligations, but it was extended to women under the principle of equality.

>>> ○ Because of this, some choose to renounce their Korean nationality or reapply for permanent residency.

>> ○ Effect of acquiring foreign nationality: Takes effect immediately.

>>> ○ **Effect 1:** You cannot use a South Korean passport.

>>> ○ **Effect 2:** You lose the benefits that come with South Korean citizenship.

>>> ○ **Effect 3:** Exemption from military service obligations.

> ③ Article 16, Clause 1 of the Nationality Act: If you lose your nationality, you must report it to the Minister of Justice.

>> ○ There are no substantial penalties for failing to report the loss of nationality in a timely manner.

> ④ Benefits of Citizenship

>> ○ U.S. citizens are eligible for U.S. Social Security benefits.

>> ○ It is easier for them to obtain bank loans for business purposes.

 ○ EC: long-term foreign investors in the CNMI (Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands)

 ○ E3: specialty occupation workers, nationals of the Commonwealth of Australia

 ○ **F1**: academic students and students in language training programs

> ○ It is illegal to work on an F1 visa: However, after obtaining an F1 visa, employment (e.g., company, postdoc) is guaranteed for 3 years through OPT

> ○ **Difference between F1 and J1**

>> ○ It's easy to transition from an F1 visa (e.g., U.S. Ph.D.) to H1, but difficult from a J1 visa (e.g., U.S. postdoc) to H1

>>> ○ Reason: J1 visa has a **5-year limitation** + you must return to your home country for 2 years after the visa expires

>> ○ When transferring SEVIS from one U.S. university to another, the F1 visa can still be used, but the J1 visa must be renewed.

>>> ○ Since a visa is a travel document, if you are not planning to leave the U.S. before the J1 visa expires, there is no need to get a new one.

>> ○ The agency responsible for H-1B visas is USCIS.

> ○ **Case 1.** For-profit institutions (e.g., company)

>> ○ H1B has a quota and is given by lottery: The competition rate for bachelor's and master's degrees is about 1:10, but it's relatively easy for doctoral talent

> ○ **Case 2.** Non-profit institutions (e.g., university)

>> ○ For postdocs or professors, it can be issued anytime regardless of the quota

>> ○ The H1 used by schools is different from the corporate one

>> ○ Research-focused universities issue H1s frequently, but smaller colleges prefer individuals with permanent residency

> ○ H-1B Cap (Lottery)

>> ○ Annual cap of 65,000

>> ○ U.S. master’s cap of 20,000

>> ○ 10,500 for E-3 Australian nationals + 6,800 for H-1B1 Chile and Singapore Free Trade Agreements

>> ○ Employer registration system applied starting from FY2021

>>> ○ Employers register early in the year

>>> ○ Selections start in mid-March

>>> ○ 90-day filing window assigned

>>> ○ Exact dates vary year-to-year

>> ○ There is a possibility to be selected in a second drawing if not initially chosen, though chances are low

>> ○ The H-1B visa year starts on October 1

>> ○ OPT STEM extensions (24 months) – Employer must participate in E-Verify

>> ○ **Case 1.** If you have a cap-subject H-1B and have not left the U.S. for more than a year or have not changed employers

>> ○ **Case 2.** Research-based nonprofit organizations: Not all nonprofit organizations qualify

>> ○ Benefit: Allows freedom to change employers

> ○ Cap-exempt to cap-subject

>> ○ If you have left the U.S. for more than a year after obtaining an H-1B visa, there is a possibility of this happening.

>> ○ If there is a sudden change in job type, there is a possibility of this happening.

>> ○ If there is a sudden change in workplace, there is a possibility of this happening.

>> ○ Due to work-from-home flexibility, there is a possibility of this happening.

> ○ Effects of Issuing an H-1B Visa

>> ○ Sponsoring an H1B is very expensive for companies; therefore, they prefer not to sponsor an H1B if the individual qualifies for OPT or J1 status.

>> ○ It is possible to have multiple H-1Bs at the same time if you are doing several jobs.

>> ○ Issued for a maximum period of three years, with the possibility to extend up to a total of six years.

>> ○ If you have an I-140 while holding an H-1B visa, the H-1B visa can be extended indefinitely.

> ○ H-1B Application Process

>> ○ Stage 1: PW (Prevailing Wage)

>>> ○ The Department of Labor sets a minimum wage to issue H1Bs only to highly skilled workers.

>> ○ Stage 2: LCA (Labor Condition Application)
  
>>> ○ It is crucial to remember that the job description must be written like a professional job, as per the intent of the H-1B.

>> ○ Stage 3: I-129: Petition and fee

>> ○ Stage 4: VISA: Visa processing (only necessary for travel)

>> ○ Additional Information:

>>> ○ If your H1B is approved in April, your OPT ends in July, and your H1B starts in October, no additional procedures are necessary.

>>> ○ When transitioning from a J1 to an H1B, keep in mind that if your J1 expires and your H1B is pending, re-entry into the U.S. may be difficult.

> ○ **H-1B and OPT**

>> ○ H-1B visas for the new fiscal year, which begins in October every year, start accepting applications on April 1, six months prior.

>> ○ If you apply for an H-1B and receive a receipt notice, you can stay in the United States until the H-1B decision is made, even if your OPT has expired.

>> ○ If you apply for an H-1B while your OPT period is still valid, you can work until the H-1B decision is made.

>> ○ If you apply for an H-1B during the 60-day grace period of your Student Visa (F-1) after OPT has ended, you can stay in the United States until the H-1B is approved, but you cannot work.

>> ○ **Difference 1.** The reason universities often use J1 instead of H1 for postdocs

>>> ○ **Reason 1.** J1 process is faster

>>> ○ **Reason 2.** The salary that needs to be paid to J1 postdocs is less: J1 has a lower minimum salary than H1

>>> ○ **Reason 3.** For J1, there is less support for health insurance or moving expenses

>> ○ It's easy to switch from an F1 visa (e.g., U.S. PhD) to H1, but difficult from a J1 visa (e.g., U.S. postdoc) to H1
