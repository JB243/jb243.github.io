## **1\. Overview**

 ⑴ Importance

> ① As the school ranking increases, the importance of language scores and grades decreases, and the SOP, along with recommendation letters, greatly influences acceptance.

>> ○ However, European universities consider grades more than American universities.

> ② As the trend of not taking the GRE increases, the importance of the SOP and research achievements has grown.

> ③ Nature of SOP **:** Closer to a qualitative assessment evaluating writing and research skills than a simple self-introduction.

>> ○ Revealing one's research up to this point can provide more insight into the applicant's inclinations and strengths.

>> ○ However, defining a "big question" for research during the degree program is also important for the future.

>> ○ In the U.S., it's not school-centered but department-centered, so the SOP is used to confirm fit with the department.

>> ○ There's a tendency not to admit students who fit well with other good schools in relation to fit.

>> ○ There can be research styles and methodologies related to fit.

>> ○ **Conclusion:** SOP is about "fit" first, "fit" second, and "fit" third.

> ④ Another aspect of the SOP: Invention proposal or business plan

>> ○ However, limited to cases where the research area of interest is focused.

> ⑤ Difference between SOP and Personal History Statement (PHS)

>> ○ PHS focuses on disadvantages and special backgrounds, making SOP play the role of a self-introduction statement.

>> ○ SOP can be publicly disclosed, whereas PHS deals with very private and personal content.

> ⑥ SOPs (Statements of Purpose) often require extensive revisions. Might they not be a good measure for evaluating things like human relationships and strategic planning?

> ⑦ However, in the future, will there be anyone who writes an SOP without using ChatGPT? Will SOPs always be important?

>> ㅇ It's true that sentence structures and word choices have become much easier.

>> ㅇ ChatGPT doesn't cover everything; one must pay a great deal of attention to the logic and structure of the writing.

>> ㅇ Aspects like one's individuality, experiences, and philosophy cannot be accurately represented by ChatGPT. Perhaps this is why such elements have become even more crucial?

⑵ Length

 ⑶ Style

> ① The SOP is not about what I want to say, but about what they want to hear.

> ② Emphasize academic writing

> ③ Keep it as simple and straightforward as possible

> ④ Be honest and write your own unique story that doesn't show up in your documents

> ⑤ Write actively, not passively, such as "I did this" instead of "It was assigned by the professor."

>> ○ It's good to have 'I' as the subject

> ⑥ Don't write in a way that ignores existing scholars

> ⑦ 'Just' is not commonly used in SOP

> ⑧ Avoid the use of 'only' as it can create a strong tone

> ⑨ 'However' usually comes at the beginning of a sentence, while 'but' is used in the middle of a sentence

> ⑩ In academic writing, starting a sentence with 'and' is unnatural, so use expressions like 'also' instead

> ⑪ Do not use contractions in SOP

>> ○ couldn't (×) → could not (○)

>> ○ they're (×) → they are (○)

>> ○ it's (×) → it is (○)

 ⑷ Process

> ① Generally, it's best to start around July-August (the earlier, the better), with the most revisions occurring in September-October.

> ② Frequent revisions are necessary: at least 3-4 times.

> ③ It's crucial to ask as many people around you as possible: the SOP might be assessing such networking skills.

> ④ Revisions continue up until the submission of the SOP.

> ⑤ The structure can be divided into two types: SOP vs. PHS, and Research Statement vs. SOP.

⑸ Proofreading

> ① ChatGPT 4.0 ( **Highly recommended** )

>> ○ AI-written text has a subtle tone **:** it reads too smoothly, uses expressions from novels, and prefers specific words

>> ○ Words preferred by ChatGPT **:** unravel, employ, realm, leverage, spearhead, showcase, pique, delve into, etc.

>> ○ Therefore, actively using paraphrasing tools is necessary

>> ○ **Example 1.** [QuillBot Paraphrasing Tool](https://quillbot.com/chrome-extension?utm_medium=paid_search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=chrome_extension_premium&campaign_type=search&gclid=CjwKCAjwgqejBhBAEiwAuWHioFx39dT5XMULmnCLD-c19iiA_WkiRSjvM7uJyXtJysb5-rdJzzIMSBoCqHcQAvD_BwE)

⑹ Evaluation

> ① Typically, after passing the document screening, 50% of applicants are accepted in the interview.

> ② The document screening is conducted by the admissions committee or graduate students.

> ③ In the document screening, the most important element is the Statement of Purpose (SOP), followed by recommendation letters.

> ④ In some cases, evaluation criteria are established for each component, and the SOP is assessed accordingly: This is why logical coherence in the SOP is crucial.
