## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ Importance

> ① The more prestigious the school, the less important language scores and grades are, with recommendation letters and **SOP playing a significant role in acceptance**

> ② However, with the emergence of ChatGPT, **recommendation letter content seems to be becoming standardized**

 ⑵ Recommenders

> ① Recommenders can be advising professors, supervising professors, professors from classes taken, professors involved in projects or papers, or company supervisors

> ② There may be bonus points if recommenders are from different affiliations

> ③ Recommenders in the USA

>> ○ If possible, it's good to ask someone in the USA to write a recommendation letter: networking plays a stronger role than expected

>> ○ Letters written by professors in the USA tend to contain strong endorsements

>> ○ Even a formal letter of recommendation from someone in the USA is meaningful

>> ○ Strategically securing a recommender in the USA, such as through exchange programs, is advantageous

> ④ Domestic professors might have less influence, but knowing them can still be helpful

> ⑤ Recommenders from related fields can be beneficial

> ⑥ Recommenders must be cautious, as overrating a poor candidate can impact their reputation

> ⑦ If your recommender or co-author is a Nobel Prize or Fields Medal laureate, you should definitely include that title in your CV. Get used to the American-style PR.

 ⑶ Content

> ① A good recommendation letter

>> ○ Should mention top % or top ranking... postdoc-level research experience... specific figures...

>> ○ Exaggeratedly positive wording should be requested

>> ○ However, a story-driven letter is more powerful than just wording

> ② The same content is often used for multiple letters, so it's advisable to request not to mention specific schools

> ③ There's no limit on the length of a recommendation letter, which can be uploaded as a PDF or Word document

> ④ Sometimes, applicants draft the letter themselves

>> ○ Or in some cases, enter it directly into the recommender's computer

>> ○ However, most universities, like Stanford, explicitly prohibit this

>> ○ Be careful as it might result in a story from the applicant's perspective, not the professor's

> ⑤ If the recommender's email is not an institutional email, a handwritten signature might be required

> ⑥ Quantitative evaluation is preferred over qualitative evaluation

 ⑷ Procedure

> ① **Step 1.** Check the required number of recommendation letters

>> ○ Both U.S. master's and Ph.D. programs usually require 3 letters, but up to 6 can be submitted depending on the school

>> ○ In the UK, Ph.D. programs require 3 letters, and master's programs require 2

>> ○ Submitting additional letters doesn't have much effect: often only the first 3 are evaluated on a first-come-first-serve basis

> ② **Step 2.** Requesting recommendation letters

>> ○ When asking for a letter, provide the recommender with a CV, SOP, transcript, and list of schools applied to

>> ○ If the applicant and recommender haven't recently worked closely, the request should be detailed and sent via email

>> ○ Start early, as writing recommendation letters can take time

> ③ **Step 3.** Entering recommender information on the application page

>> ○ Preferably use the recommender's institutional email address

>>> ○ Using a Gmail address, for example, may require additional steps

>>> ○ Such as a handwritten signature

>> ○ **Waiver** **:** Giving up the right to view the recommendation letter

>>> ○ Under The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, applicants have the right to view recommendation letters

>>> ○ However, waiving this right makes the letter seem more honest and trustworthy to the admission committee

>>> ○ Some departments don't evaluate letters without a waiver: it's considered a formality but doesn't impact the requirement

>> ○ Once the recommender submits the documents, the recommendation status changes, and a confirmation page and email are sent to both the **recommender and applicant**

>> ○ Most schools prefer uploading letters into a specific system rather than sending them via email

>> ○ Some schools allow using letter services like [Interfolio](https://www.interfolio.com/)’s Dossier service

>>> ○ However, [Stanford](https://biosciences.stanford.edu/how-to-apply/#:~:text=Letters%20of%20recommendation%20cannot%20be%20submitted%20via%20a%20letter%20service%20\(i.e

.%20Interfolio\)%2C%20mailed%2C%20emailed%2C%20or%20faxed.) explicitly prohibits the use of Interfolio

> ④ **Step 4.** Recommendation letter deadline

>> ○ **Case 1.** Some schools require all recommendation letters to be submitted before accepting the application

>> ○ **Case 2.** Applications can be submitted even if not all letters are in, and document evaluation starts shortly after

>> ○ **Case 3.** Some schools explicitly set a specific date after the application deadline for recommendation letters

> ⑤ **Step 5.** After submitting the recommendation letters

>> ○ Thank you mail: it's good to send thank you emails to recommenders after application deadlines

>> ○ If there are doubts about the letter's content, the admission committee might contact the recommender again
