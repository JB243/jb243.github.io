⑶ Length

> ① Short length is preferred: Keep it concise within 2 pages, sometimes written in just 1 page.

>> ○ **Reason 1.** The admission committee will be reviewing numerous applicants' CVs, so it needs to be easily readable.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Keeping the CV short can increase the applicant's chances of being perceived as interesting, thus increasing the chances of being interviewed.

>> ○ **Reason 3.** Institutions like Johns Hopkins University explicitly require the CV to be a maximum of 2 pages.

>> ○ **Reason 4.** It's important to write concisely and clearly because the admissions documents are often skimmed through quickly during the review process.

> ② It's not strictly necessary for the length to be within 2 pages.

> ③ To reduce the length, methods such as reducing margins and using commas to shorten lines can be used.

> ④ It's recommended to mention details not covered in the CV on a separate [website](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2245).

>> ○ Details not covered in CV **:** presentation, coursework, skill, supporting documents, etc.

> ⑤ However, some schools require a more detailed CV (e.g., Caltech)

>> ○ teaching, professional, and vocational experience

>> ○ research experience

>> ○ major academic recognitions, honors, and memberships

>> ○ professional activities

>> ○ significant extracurricular activities

>> ○ conference presentations

>> ○ titles of publications, major papers, or theses authored or co-authored
