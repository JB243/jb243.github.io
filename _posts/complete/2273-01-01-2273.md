## **1. Justice by Aristotle**

⑴ The three elements of persuasion—logos, pathos, and ethos—are each related to propositions of fact, value, and policy, respectively.

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Justice by Michael Sandel** 

⑴ Introduces various theories of justice such as utilitarianism and hedonism and points out their problems.

⑵ Utilitarianism: The view that the choice that maximizes the greatest number of interests is just.

⑶ Hedonism: The view that the choice that maximizes the sum of the greatest number of happiness is just.

⑷ **Thought Experiment 1.** Trolley dillema: What choice should be made when one person and five people are on different train tracks and the train must go down one?

⑸ **Thought Experiment 2.** Is a society where one person becomes maximally unhappy and the rest are happy a just society?

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Justice by Bourdieu**

⑴ The position that the ideologies and philosophies of the powerful are justice.

> ① Power is objective, clear, and somewhat exclusive.

> ② In the Paleolithic Age, for people whose intuition was not yet developed, the logic of arrogance and the logic of power were helpful for survival.

⑵ Strength: Very clear.

⑶ Weakness: When discussing theories of justice, value judgments are lost, and only factual judgments remain.

> ① For example, the implication that every act of a dictator is just: What use is a theory of justice without judgment?

<br>

<br>

## **4.[Welfare Economics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044)**

⑴ An attempt to explain theories of justice in economic terms.

⑵ Concepts of [efficiency](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044) and [equity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044) appear.

<br>

<br>

## **5.[Introduction to Law](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1733)**

⑴ Describes the concept, purpose, and form of existence of law aimed at realizing social justice.

⑵ The law must be equal for everyone as a derivative logic.

## **7\. My Concept of Justice**

⑴ What is justice?

> ① **Proposition 1.** Human value judgments are homogeneous to some extent; that is, they are relatively static.

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Power is objective, and the logic of power exists in some corner of everyone’s mind.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Because memories from the Paleolithic era are reflected in our DNA.

> ② **Proposition 2. Naturalistic fallacy:** A value judgment cannot be derived from factual judgment alone.

>> ○ There are cases where factual judgment and value judgment are intertwined. “There is half the water left” and “There is only half the water left” express the same fact, yet each contains a different value judgment.

>> ○ Then how do value judgments arise? In infancy, most value judgments originate from parents’ value judgments. But as the child grows older, those judgments go through a continual process of being updated by the child’s innate value preferences (e.g., “I like music”).

>> ○ One can evaluate the logical coherence of another person’s value judgment on the basis of factual judgments.

>> ○ An individual’s value judgments can be triggered by others or by the environment. This is because, when assessing the logical coherence of a value judgment, it is easy to adopt another person’s factual judgments as they are. However, such triggered value judgments neither form one’s identity nor matter much since people may deliberately give false advice.

>> ○ That person’s trajectory through life can also give rise to value judgments. However, that is something like a fate bestowed upon—and enjoyed by—only that person.

>> ○ However, one can infer the logical structure of another person’s value judgments as a matter of fact—for example, when they state it explicitly, or when it can be implicitly inferred from their actions.

> ③ **Proposition 3.** Every value judgment ultimately reduces to a single overarching premise.

>> ○ People become contradictory because they take two or more values as overarching premises.

>> ○ Because value judgments ultimately converge into one, I think value judgments do not carry much information.

>> ○ It is difficult to obtain useful information from politicians’ statements, which are mostly composed of value judgments; at best, one can only check whether they serve the interests of the majority based on the logic of power.

> ④ **Proposition 4. Relativism:** No value can be said to be superior to another.

>> ○ If there is no shared value, communication is impossible. Some people do not even have the logic of power. I’m somewhat like that.

>> ○ I should respect others’ value judgments because of pluralism, not because of nihilism or laissez-faire attitudes.

>> ○ Based on the logic of power, pursuing the public good—such as “the greatest happiness for the greatest number”—is generally desirable. (*The altruist’s gain.*)

>> ○ Based on the logic of power, sustainable happiness is generally desirable. In that case, criticizing reckless consumption habits, drug use, and so on is justified, because it falls under factual judgments about sustainability.
 
⑵ **Major Premise 1.** The value of a person is the most precious (**Individualism**)

> ① Human value refers to the intellectual ability of humans to create something from nothing and does not discriminate against any field.

> ② On average, it is judged that two people are more precious than one: My response to Michael Sandel's **Thought Experiment 1** (i.e., trolley dillema).

⑶ **Major Premise 2.** **Justice** is about minimizing the total contradictions in society. It varies by group and prioritizes social stabilization. (**Collectivism** )

> ① Influenced by Kantianism.

> ② Contradictions are inherently objective, hence the concept of justice has **objectivity**. For example, the main contradiction in Neo-Confucianism was the Ye Song controversy.

> ③ Since the concept varies by group, the concept of justice has flexibility.

> ④ Justice seeks social stabilization and therefore has morality.

> ⑤ Reducing contradictions by creating contradictions is not just. Therefore, excessive reforms are also wrong.

> ⑥ Unjust groups cannot survive according to **evolutionary theory**.

> ⑦ Even if the intention is pure, if the outcome is a mess, it is not just.

> ⑧ Even if the intention is impure, if the outcome benefits the group, it is just, but according to game theory, this is difficult.

⑷ Sub-conclusion

> ① It seems that each individual must choose between **Major Premise 1** and **Major Premise 2**.

> ② One cannot logically refute a pessimist or relativist based on belief. This is because two independent and stable logical systems do not have logical superiority over each other regarding their mutual contradictions.

> ③ There is nothing to learn from the value judgments of others. One can only verify the logical consistency of another one's own value judgments.

>> ○ Example of another's value judgment: "I dislike you."

>> ○ If there are no shared value judgments at all, comparing individuals in terms of superiority or inferiority becomes impossible. It is similar to the relationship between common trade goods and exchange rates between countries.

>> ○ The logic of power is a value judgment shared by most people.

>> ○ Even the very fact that I maintain a relationship with that person is an example of the value judgment we are sharing.

> ④ The relationship between value judgment and fact judgment: Value judgments provide motivation for new fact judgments.

>> ○ **Example:** I want to conduct this research to treat cancer patients.

⑸ Final Conclusion 

> ① The value of an individual and the value of a collective lie in knowledge. Knowledge itself has levels, and this hierarchy resolves the tension between **Major Premise 1** and **Major Premise 2**.

> ② Because the world is dynamic (that is, knowledge has a tendency to disappear), both the amount of knowledge and the speed at which it is created matter.

> ③ Ultimately, knowledge is closely tied to enjoyment. I hope this world—and humanity—can keep creating infinite knowledge and continue growing forever. (“[For an eternally fascinating world](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2424).”)
