## **1. Justice by Aristotle**

⑴ The three elements of persuasion—logos, pathos, and ethos—are each related to propositions of fact, value, and policy, respectively.

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Justice by Michael Sandel** 

⑴ Introduces various theories of justice such as utilitarianism and hedonism and points out their problems.

⑵ Utilitarianism: The view that the choice that maximizes the greatest number of interests is just.

⑶ Hedonism: The view that the choice that maximizes the sum of the greatest number of happiness is just.

⑷ **Thought Experiment 1.** Trolley dillema: What choice should be made when one person and five people are on different train tracks and the train must go down one?

⑸ **Thought Experiment 2.** Is a society where one person becomes maximally unhappy and the rest are happy a just society?

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Justice by Bourdieu**

⑴ The position that the ideologies and philosophies of the powerful are justice.

> ① Power is objective, clear, and somewhat exclusive.

> ② In the Paleolithic Age, for people whose intuition was not yet developed, the logic of arrogance and the logic of power were helpful for survival.

⑵ Strength: Very clear.

⑶ Weakness: When discussing theories of justice, value judgments are lost, and only factual judgments remain.

> ① For example, the implication that every act of a dictator is just: What use is a theory of justice without judgment?

<br>

<br>

## **4.[Welfare Economics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044)**

⑴ An attempt to explain theories of justice in economic terms.

⑵ Concepts of [efficiency](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044) and [equity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044) appear.

<br>

<br>

## **5.[Introduction to Law](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1733)**

⑴ Describes the concept, purpose, and form of existence of law aimed at realizing social justice.

⑵ The law must be equal for everyone as a derivative logic.

## **7\. My Concept of Justice**

⑴ What is justice?

> ① **Proposition 1.** Value judgments cannot be derived from factual judgments alone.

>> ○ There are cases where factual judgments and value judgments are mixed. For instance, 'the glass is half full' and 'the glass is only half empty' are the same factual judgments but involve different value judgments.

> ② **Proposition 2.** All value judgments eventually converge to a single major premise.

>> ○ People face contradictions because they consider more than one value as a major premise.

>> ○ Since value judgments ultimately converge to one, it is believed that value judgments do not contain a lot of information.

>> ○ Perhaps that is why it is difficult to obtain useful information from politicians' statements that mostly consist of value judgments.

> ③ **Proposition 3.** Naturalistic fallacy: No value can be considered superior to another.

>> ○ There is room to evaluate the appropriateness of others' value judgments to some extent through factual judgment.  

>> ○ The reason I should respect others' value judgments is because of pluralism, not nihilism or laissez-faire.  

>> ○ The pursuit of the public good, such as the greatest happiness for the greatest number, is generally desirable.  

>> ○ It is possible to assess whether happiness is sustainable. Pointing out reckless consumption habits or drug use is desirable, as it falls under factual judgment.  

>> ○ Let us note that value judgments formed during infancy are shaped by parental influence.  

>> ○ An individual's value judgments can be triggered by others or by the environment. Such externally induced value judgments do not contribute to shaping an individual's identity and are therefore of lower importance.  

⑵ **Major Premise 1.** The value of a person is the most precious (**Individualism**)

> ① Human value refers to the intellectual ability of humans to create something from nothing and does not discriminate against any field.

> ② On average, it is judged that two people are more precious than one: My response to Michael Sandel's **Thought Experiment 1** (i.e., trolley dillema).

⑶ **Major Premise 2.** **Justice** is about minimizing the total contradictions in society. It varies by group and prioritizes social stabilization. (**Collectivism** )

> ① Influenced by Kantianism.

> ② Contradictions are inherently objective, hence the concept of justice has **objectivity**. For example, the main contradiction in Neo-Confucianism was the Ye Song controversy.

> ③ Since the concept varies by group, the concept of justice has flexibility.

> ④ Justice seeks social stabilization and therefore has morality.

> ⑤ Reducing contradictions by creating contradictions is not just. Therefore, excessive reforms are also wrong.

> ⑥ Unjust groups cannot survive according to **evolutionary theory**.

> ⑦ Even if the intention is pure, if the outcome is a mess, it is not just.

> ⑧ Even if the intention is impure, if the outcome benefits the group, it is just, but according to game theory, this is difficult.

⑷ Sub-conclusion

> ① It seems that each individual must choose between **Major Premise 1** and **Major Premise 2**.

> ② One cannot logically refute a pessimist or relativist based on belief. This is because two independent and stable logical systems do not have logical superiority over each other regarding their mutual contradictions.

> ③ There is nothing to learn from the value judgments of others. One can only verify the logical consistency of another one's own value judgments.

>> ○ Example of another's value judgment: "I dislike you."

>> ○ If there are no shared value judgments at all, comparing individuals in terms of superiority or inferiority becomes impossible. It is similar to the relationship between common trade goods and exchange rates between countries.

>> ○ Even the very fact that I maintain a relationship with that person is an example of the value judgment we are sharing.

> ④ The relationship between value judgment and fact judgment: Value judgments provide motivation for new fact judgments.

>> ○ **Example:** I want to conduct this research to treat cancer patients.

⑸ Final Conclusion 

> ① The value of an individual and the value of a collective lie in knowledge. Knowledge itself has levels, and this hierarchy resolves the tension between **Major Premise 1** and **Major Premise 2**.

> ② Because the world is dynamic (that is, knowledge has a tendency to disappear), both the amount of knowledge and the speed at which it is created matter.

> ③ Ultimately, knowledge is closely tied to enjoyment. I hope this world—and humanity—can keep creating infinite knowledge and continue growing forever. (“[For an eternally fascinating world](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2424).”)
