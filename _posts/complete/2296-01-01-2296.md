※ Please note that the following principles are based on natural sciences colleges, not engineering colleges.

<br>

#### **A. Study Abroad Philosophy** 

**1.** **Studying abroad** is a noble journey in search of hope.

<br>

**2.** The most successful example of studying abroad was Jang Bogo, the maritime officer.

<br>

**3.** Studying abroad is often referred to as a lonely path.

<br>

**4.** If you look carefully, there are study abroad exams all year round. Therefore, there's no need to fear failure in studying abroad, just the courage to continue is needed.

> ○ **Example 5.** PSI website 

> ○ **Example 6.** academicpositions.eu 

> ○ **Example 7.** jobs.ch 

> ○ **Example 8.** alpha.ch 

> ○ **Example 9.** topjobs.ch

> ○ **Example 10.** jobscout24.ch 

> ○ **Example 11.** Recently, PhD and Postdoc position openings have been frequently posted on LinkedIn.

<br>

**5.** Regarding failure,

> ○ Approach admissions fiercely, but face failure gracefully.

> ○ Grad admission never fails. You just have to keep trying until you succeed.

<br>

**6.** I wanted to open up many possibilities for those who thirst for success by sharing information on studying abroad.

<br>

**7.** Study abroad admissions and study abroad life are closely related to the presence of funding.

> ○ Departments with abundant funding have many out-of-quotas positions (e.g., direct admits) and many opportunities post-graduation (e.g., faculty appointments). ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2411))

> ○ Departments with limited funding prefer domestics over internationals. This is because tuition fees are cheaper, and some funding is only available to domestics.

> ○ Departments with limited funding provide less support for equipment, departmental travel, and program benefits.

> ○ In departments with limited funding, students who fail qualifying exams or fail to match with a PI are often matched with a PI from another department or graduate with a Master's degree.

> ○ In departments with limited funding, students often have to serve as TAs to cover tuition fees. This is because the TA salary is provided by the school, not the department or the PI.

> ○ EECS and medical schools have abundant funding, followed by other engineering schools. Natural sciences departments have relatively less funding.

> ○ The University of California system has been experiencing a recent lack of funds (e.g., 2023-2024 student protests). This might be a reason for the high dropout rates in PhD programs.

<br>

**8.** If you are special, studying abroad is even more challenging.

<br>

**9.** Think of yourself as a winner, and you will win.

> ○ In a study abroad interview, being too impressive can be problematic (because it might give the impression that you'll go elsewhere), but it's better than underperforming. However, a truly skilled person can also control that 'impression.'

> ○ For study abroad applications, it's important to have some confidence. You need to be someone they want.

> ○ In my first study abroad application, I was too kind and weak. By the third application, I was full of confidence. By the third time, I succeeded.

> ○ Donald Trump once said something similar: "You should think like you are a winner."

> ○ This principle can also be applied to various issues in daily life (e.g., dating, marriage). I don't want you to be sweet. I'd prefer you to be more edgy.

<br>

**10.** Studying abroad might be a kind of game in a way. I hope you enjoy the journey.

<br>

**11.** Studying abroad felt a lot like an election—because nothing is guaranteed.

> ○ I learned that even if a PI in a Swiss program says, "You are my favorite!", you might still get rejected. Until you receive an official offer, you can never be sure you’ve been accepted, and if luck isn’t on your side, you simply might not make it.

<br>

**12.** Studying abroad is somewhat like earning a hard-to-get certification. For example, it comes with important side effects like getting a visa and gaining entry into a networked society.

<br>

<br>

#### **B. Admission Strategy** 

**13.** It is better to apply to larger departments (e.g., umbrella program) rather than small ones.

<br>

**14.** First, second, and third are all about the fit with the department.

<br>

**15.** The more school searches, the better. 

> ○ When it comes to applications, the more the better. We can't choose whether we get accepted or not, but we can choose the number of applications we submit.

<br>

**16.** About research area, 

> ○ In fields like economics, the reputation (or brand value) of a school seems quite important, while in life sciences and related fields, it's crucial to seek out authoritative researchers.

> ○ For departments like physics, admission outcomes often correlate with GPA, whereas in fields like life sciences, 'fitness' seems more important, leading to a weaker correlation.

> ○ One must stay updated with the latest scientific trends, e.g., spatial transcriptomics, neuro-immuno interaction, chemical biology, Method of the Year.

> ○ The U.S. has distinctly made its mark in artificial intelligence, structural biology, and biochemistry.

<br>

**17.** You should avoid places with actually low acceptance rates (e.g., MIT csbphd).

<br>

**18.** You should avoid areas where the competition is really fierce (e.g., computer science, bioinformatics).

> ○ However, as I have been accepted into a bioinformatics program before, it's not that one is completely unable to succeed, but rather that it's difficult to have high expectations.

<br>

**19.** The department should have a lot of Teaching Assistants for foreigners.

<br>

**20.** You need to broaden your choices through various research.

<br>

**21.** Don't just apply to the department you want to go to, apply in a continuous spectrum from the place you most want to go to the place you least want to go.

<br>

**22.** About the importance of Statement of Purpose (SOP),

> ○ SOP is not about what I want to say, but about what they want to hear.

> ○ While U.S. doctoral program admissions rely on qualitative evaluations such as SOP (Statement of Purpose) and letters of recommendation, European doctoral program admissions in countries like the UK and Switzerland depend on quantitative evaluations.

> ○ One should avoid esoteric ideas in the SOP.

> ○ Given that most topics have already been researched, the SOP should present a big question.

> ○ People enjoy interesting stories, and the ones that are easy to understand are exactly the ones they find interesting.

<br>

**23.** Regarding the difficulty of studying abroad,

> ○ The global population increase implies that the difficulty of studying abroad will increase.

> ○ The gains from [catch-up growth](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1975) in developing countries, with improved technological levels, also contribute to the increasing difficulty of studying abroad.

<br>

**24.** There are departments where [pre-contact](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2252) is not necessary (A; _e.g._, Stanford Biosciences), recommended (B; _e.g._, Harvard SSQB), and mandatory (C; _e.g._, Harvard OEB). Pre-contact can help understand the Teaching Assistant situation and gauge the direction of the SOP, so it may be more strategic to focus on (B), (C).

<br>

**25.** Toning down is a virtue for both papers and SOP.

<br>

**26.** You must truly love research.

> ○ I learned a good mindset [here](https://blog.naver.com/salgoji_crayfish/223520899159)).

> ○ Another good example: [Yale BBS](https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=suehyunmoon&logNo=223742464932&categoryNo=17&proxyReferer=&noTrackingCode=true) 

<br>

<br>

#### **C. Miscellaneous**

**27.** In a country like South Korea, where the culture around dating and marriage is somewhat distorted, it may be more strategic to study abroad in several ways.

<br>

**28.** The only three options for changing schools are law school, medical school, and studying abroad, all of which are not easy processes.

> ○ However, there was a case around me who achieved all three: studying abroad, law school, and medical school.

<br>

**29.** The world changes so quickly that yesterday's study abroad trends are different from today's.

<br>

**30.** The reason domestic scholarship foundations consider whether students are enrolled in high schools or universities in the country is to maximize the benefits for the country.

> ○ Students from domestic institutions are more in need of economic and non-economic assistance compared to those from foreign high schools and universities.

> ○ Students from domestic institutions are more likely to return to the country.

> ○ Students from domestic institutions are more likely to have domestic networks, increasing their chances of obtaining key positions.

<br>

**31.** The lessons learned from studying abroad apply equally to human relationships.

> ○ Be careful with people... The people around you might not want you to study abroad.

<br>

**32.** The requirement of SOP, LOR, and CV instead of quantitative evaluation in graduate school admissions is in part to limit the number of Jewish admissions (in the 1920s) or Asian admissions (since the 1990s).
