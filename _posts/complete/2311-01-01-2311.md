⑵ **2-1.** Visit <https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/glacier-tax-prep-software>

⑶ **2-2.** Click Access GLACIER Tax Prep Software

⑷ **2-3.** Upload Form 1042-S under "What Income Statements Did You Receive in 2024?"

> ① If your U.S. income is only a stipend, generally only Form 1042-S is needed

> ② 1042-S is a form for reporting scholarship, fellowship, or other tax-exempt income received by nonresident aliens

> ③ Since stipend is considered fellowship income and not earned income, it is reported via 1042-S rather than W-2 or 1099-MISC

> ④ If the stipend is compensation for work (e.g., research or TA), it may be reported via W-2

> ⑤ If you also received earned income (W-2), dividends (1099-DIV), bank interest (1099-INT), etc., those forms must also be included

⑸ **2-4.** U.S.-Korea Tax Treaty Exemption Application

> ① According to the U.S.-Korea tax treaty, scholarship or fellowship income may be exempt from tax. If your stipend qualifies, it is advantageous to select "Yes" to receive the maximum exemption

> ② Even if the scholarship is purely non-compensatory, a stipend received in the U.S. can still be exempt under the U.S.-Korea treaty, so "Yes" is appropriate

> ③ Even if this is your first year receiving the scholarship, the IRS judges based on the tax year, so treaty benefits apply from this year

⑹ **2-5.** Taxation in Korea

> ① If the scholarship is purely non-compensatory, select "No"

> ② If it resembles compensation or tax was withheld, select "Yes"

> ③ If the scholarship is not taxable in Korea, reporting is unnecessary; "No" is correct

⑺ **2-6.** Visa Number

> ① Red-marked letter or number at the bottom right of the F-1 visa section in the passport

> ② Must be 8 characters

## **D. Step 3.** Federal Tax: Print W-7 Related Documents

⑸ Notes

> ① If you applied for an ITIN when filing your U.S. income tax return, the U.S. government will notify you whether your ITIN has been issued or your application has been rejected.

> ② You do not need to pay anyone to get an ITIN: such websites are scam websites (confirmed by the University of Michigan).
