Questions arise concerning intelligence or intellect.

* What is collective intelligence? Can society be seen as a higher intellectual being that cannot be predicted by human cognition?

* Why can only humans do high school, unlike other animals?

* Will machines eventually have the same intelligence as humans?

* Can it be said that an extremely well-equipped arbitrary system, such as the environment or the earth, also has intelligence? In other words, do they have a high degree of information processing power that is not explained by randomness?

<br>

In this regard, there is a noteworthy study. In the research titled "[ _Landmann, S., Holmes, C. M., & Tikhonov, M. (2021). A simple regulatory architecture allows learning the statistical structure of a changing environment. Elife, 10, e67455.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/67455)", it's discussed how a system can establish deep learning-like information circuits with just a simple [control system](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1909) and a non-linear activation function, and how it can learn information provided by the environment.

Through this, it can be said that species evolution, machine systems, and even systems like the Earth, when equipped with non-linearity, organic intermodularity (i.e., proximity between components) and other such features, possess intelligence, specifically a high level of information processing ability that cannot be explained by randomness alone. Moreover, the spatial arrangement of cells within living organisms could itself function as a conceptual unit of artificial intelligence, capable of learning information at a level beyond DNA, RNA, and proteins. For example, interpersonal interactions, when viewed from a broader perspective, can be seen as part of a vast neural network—what we call collective intelligence. Indeed, slime molds, which are unicellular organisms, are known to carry out sophisticated information processing by forming collectives despite lacking a brain. ([ref](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KJfHzxtHCBs)) The book _<Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection>_ likewise reports that the more similar people’s brain waves are, the better they communicate, and that social interactions involve a process of tuning those brain waves.

The universe is often referred to as the macrocosm, and humans as the microcosm. Perhaps it's not just humans who think; the universe might also think. However, it's not believed that such a system possesses self-awareness. This is because self-awareness is considered a unique phenomenon that naturally occurs when low entropy is densely concentrated.
