> ⑤ **Direction 5:** Quantum computing

> ⑥ **Direction 6:** [Bioinformatics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/836)

> ⑦ Application deadlines differ from other departments.

>> ○ General departments usually have a deadline of December 1st.

>> ○ The CS department usually has a deadline of December 15th.

>> ○ This can be used to plan applications distinguishing between non-CS and CS departments.

 ⑸ Electronic Engineering (EE)

> ① **Direction 1:** Semiconductor design and systems engineering

> ② **Direction 2:** Healthcare devices

> ③ **Direction 3:** Medical devices (e.g., [MRI](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1842))

> ④ **Direction 4:** Quantum computing

 ⑹ Structural Biology

> ① **Direction 1:** Structural determination experiments using biophysics tools like cryo-EM, NMR, X-ray crystallography

> ② **Direction 2:** AI modeling based on proteomics **:** Structure prediction is nearly complete (cf. AlphaFold2), now the issue is predicting binding affinity.

> ③ [Related school list](https://qr.ae/psXu8h)

 ⑺ Biology

> ① **Direction 1:** Theoretical biology and evolutionary biology **:** Biology departments uniquely emphasize evolution-related topics.

> ② **Direction 2:** Behavioral experiments

> ③ **Direction 3:** Omics

 ⑻ Bioengineering

> ① **Direction 1:** Imaging **:** super-resolution microscope, [imaging devices](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1202), etc.

> ② **Direction 2:** Sequencing

> ③ **Direction 3:** Modeling

> ④ **Direction 4:** Bio artificial intelligence

 ⑼ Bioinformatics vs. Computational Biology

> ① Bioinformatics (BI) **:** Similar to data science, it requires a significant background in biology. Feels relatively like humanities.

> ② Computational biology **:** Similar to computer science, it involves methods, deep learning, AI, etc. Feels more like natural sciences.

> ③ Various predictions about the trends in the future of bioinformatics (BI)

>> ○ Argument 1 **:** Given the emergence of AI programs in Harvard BIG and the prospect that [LLM](https://jb243.github.io/pages/325) can largely replace BI, there is a tendency for BI to become more like computational biology, and it is expected that even the term 'bioinformatics' might disappear in about 10 years. (<span style="color: orange">Bioinformatics Dropping Factor</span>)

>> ○ Argument 2 **:** The mention of bioinformatics in fields such as biochemistry, developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and physics suggests that the scope of bioinformatics itself may expand. Academic disciplines that cannot build extensive omics fields like the "protein universe" may decline. (<span style="color: green">Bioinformatics Rising Factor</span>)

>> ○ Argument 3 **:** A trend that has become apparent recently is that while AI may not be very profitable, BI generates revenue, especially in the United States. Given the 400-year technology gap between Korea and the US in AI, BI is likely to be even more lucrative in Korea. (<span style="color: green">Bioinformatics Rising Factor</span>)

>> ○ Argument 4 **:** Every field is already trying to integrate with AI, and the adoption of AI in high-context areas such as quantum, bio, and space is observed to have its own uniqueness and industrial value. (<span style="color: green">Bioinformatics Rising Factor</span>)

⑽ Biostatistics

> ① Often found in Public Health Schools.

> ② Strong background in statistics is required for admission.

 ⑾ Biomedical Informatics (BMI)

> ① While general bioinformatics is similar to CS and computational biology, BMI seems to focus more on health records.

<br>

<br>

#### **2\. Graduate School Life**

⑴ Admission Offer

> ① **Stage 1:** Informal Admission Offer **:** The PhD program recommends the applicant to the graduate office.

> ② **Stage 2:** Formal Admission Offer **:** After the informal admission offer, the graduate office checks the accuracy of the documents and finalizes the confirmation of admission.

⑵ Dormitories

> ① Most graduate schools offer dormitory support for about 2 years.

> ② In cases like WashU, dormitory support is not provided.

> ③ At places like Stanford, Weill Cornell, and Sloan Kettering, dormitory support is available throughout the program.

⑶ Visas

> ① Typically, student visas are F-1 or J-1.

> ② [Fulbright Scholarships](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2176) may lead to J-1 visas, while other government scholars may receive G-1 visas.

> ③ If you want to secure a job in the US job market, you will need an H-1 visa.

> ④ US companies are often hesitant to sponsor visas for individuals without them for various reasons.

> ⑤ F-1 visas have longer validity compared to J-1 visas, which is advantageous when entering the job market.

> ⑥ To obtain US permanent residency (green card), it requires hiring an attorney, costs around 20 million KRW, and over a year of continuous US residency.

⑷ Rotation

> ① In the rotation, the department bears the cost.

> ② In cases like UCSD BISB, where the funding primarily comes from NIH grants, only domestic students are supported for rotations, so international students cannot participate in the rotations.

⑸ Salary

> ① Labs with sufficient funding typically offer full tuition fee funding plus a stipend.

> ② The stipend is up to 40,000 USD/year. Even in cases where it goes up to 48,000 USD/year, when considering living expenses, it amounts to a similar level (e.g., New York City).

> ③ Industry Internship

>> ○ It is uncommon to do it in the first year of a Ph.D.

>> ○ Internships typically take place from May to August.

>> ○ Even if it's not at the same place, it works to your advantage when finding a job after completing the Ph.D.
