"Exploration is like finding one's way by asking for directions; it involves asking a question, answering it, discovering the next question, and then answering that, in a process that is connected as one." - Max Perutz 

<br>

Recently, I had a final interview at [ETH Zurich](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2327). From now on, the final acceptance rate seems to be about 50%. The technology of spacetime transposition beyond spatial transposition was in front of my eyes, and they asked me how I would
interpret this data. At that time, the keyword 'hypothesis-generating AI' came to my mind. It was a topic that received an intense reaction, but I thought it might have been esoteric to them and even overwhelming for me.

In fact, generating hypotheses through data was an insight I gained from the company where I had been working for over two years. Drug development is sometimes a marathon that lasts over 10 years, and many fail upon encountering unexpected clinical trial results in the final stages. Therefore, the company attempted smart drug development strategies, constructing storytelling by generating hypotheses in reverse based on clinical trial results. Thus, the approach of creating hypotheses from data was not foreign to me, and I thought that in the era of ChatGPT, AI could also generate hypotheses.

When I pondered where the idea of 'hypothesis-generating AI' came from, it seemed to start from the paper "[Beyond RG: from parameter flow to metric flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12420)" (Strandkvist, C. et al). It was a challenging but quite interesting mathematical theory of generating theories from high-dimensional parameters.

<br>

Mulling over this paper, as the dimensions of data increase and interpretability decreases, my plan to create a hypothesis-generating AI seemed not just a fanciful story but a truly feasible future. Therefore, I actually developed a machine learning algorithm, experimenting with establishing hypotheses and testing various aspects to find truly valid and appropriate hypotheses.

The specific problems I'm currently focusing on are as follows:

"There are six beads of the same size and shape. Among these, three are heavy, and the other three are light. However, the three heavy beads weigh the same, and the three light beads also weigh the same. Now, using a two-pan balance scale three times, separate the beads into heavy and light groups."

There were the following considerations:

> ○ Machine learning code is divided into parts for generating strategies and verifying them.

> ○ The method of comparison using a balance scale always proceeds in groups of 3 vs 3, 2 vs 2, 1 vs 1. This is because it is difficult to obtain valid information in other cases. There was much deliberation on how to define the 'information' gained by comparing with a balance scale. In fact, it might be possible to define such 'information' probabilistically or algebraically. ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2145)) However, currently limited by my capabilities, I decided to actively utilize the necessary and sufficient condition of 'narrowing down the possibilities' captured by comparing with a balance scale, prioritizing combinatorial thinking.

> ○ The combinations of possible heavy sets given a strategy and balance scale comparison results are defined as potential heavy set(s). Here, not only cases where there is 1 potential heavy set but also cases with 0 are considered valid, as it's necessary to avoid rejecting a truly valid strategy due to completely irrelevant information.

 Now, let's complete the code for creating and verifying strategies through several trials and errors.

 ⑴ **3 vs 3** Given information like (1, 2, 3) ＞ (4, 5, 6), (1, 2, 4) ＞ (3, 5, 6), (1, 2, 5) ＞ (3, 4, 6), output potential heavy set(s)

def get_potential_heavy_sets(weighing1, weighing2, weighing3):
    # Initial beads
    beads = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    
    potential_heavy_sets1 = [combo for combo in combinations(beads, 3) if len(set(combo) & set(weighing1)) >= 2]    
    potential_heavy_sets2 = [combo for combo in combinations(beads, 3) if len(set(combo) & set(weighing2)) >= 2]
    potential_heavy_sets3 = [combo for combo in combinations(beads, 3) if len(set(combo) & set(weighing3)) >= 2]

    # Intersect the three potential heavy sets
    final_potential_heavy_sets = list(set(potential_heavy_sets1) & set(potential_heavy_sets2) & set(potential_heavy_sets3))
    
    return final_potential_heavy_sets

I couldn't find the answer and reviewed various cases, gaining important insights. In fact, the solution should not be structured as a 
[simultaneous game](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1914#footnote_link_67_51) but as a 
[sequential game](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1914#footnote_link_67_52). For example, the answer is as follows, and the reason I didn't further develop the code is purely due to _**my whim**_.

**Answer**

> ⑴ Assign numbers 1 to 6 to the given 6 balls.

> ⑵ **Step 1.** Compare (1, 2) with (3, 4).

> ⑶ **Case 1.** (1, 2) > (3, 4)

>> ① Heavy ball combinations

>>> ○ (1, 2, 3)

>>> ○ (1, 2, 4)

>>> ○ (1, 2, 5)

>>> ○ (1, 2, 6)

>>> ○ (1, 5, 6)

>>> ○ (2, 5, 6)

>> ② **Step 2.** Compare ball 3 with ball 6

>> ③ **Step 3.** Depending on the result of **Step 2**, use the following different strategies.

>>> ○ 3 > 6: No further action, decide on (1, 2, 3)

>>> ○ 3 = 6: Compare ball 4 with ball 5 to uniquely decide between (1, 2, **4** ), (1, 2, **5** )

>>> ○ 3 < 6: Compare ball 1 with ball 2 to uniquely decide between ( **1** , **2** , 6), ( **1** , 5, 6), (**2** , 5, 6)

> ⑷ **Case 2.** (1, 2) = (3, 4)

>> ① Heavy ball combinations

>>> ○ (1, 3, 5)

>>> ○ (1, 3, 6)

>> ② **Step 2.** Compare (1, 3) with (2, 5).

>> ③ **Step 3.** Depending on the result of **Step 2**, use the following different strategies.

>>> ○ (1, 3) > (2, 5): Compare ball 4 with ball 5 to uniquely decide among (1, 3, **5** ), (1, 3, 6), (1, **4**, 6)

**Wrong Answer.** Starting with 3 vs 3: **Step 1** reduces the possibilities to 10, and in **Step 2**, dividing into 3, 3,
4, but in **Step 3**, the 4-part cannot be determined

> ⑴ **** Assign numbers 1 to 6 to the given 6 balls.

> ⑵ **Step 1.** Compare (1, 2, 3) with (4, 5, 6). By symmetry, we can assume (1, 2, 3) < (4, 5, 6). The combinations of heavy balls are as follows.

>> ① (1, 4, 5)

>> ② (1, 4, 6)

>> ③ (1, 5, 6)

>> ④ (2, 4, 5)

>> ⑤ (2, 4, 6)

>> ⑥ (2, 5, 6)

>> ⑦ (3, 4, 5)

>> ⑧ (3, 4, 6)

>> ⑨ (3, 5, 6)

>> ⑩ (4, 5, 6)

> ⑶ **Step 2.** Compare (1, 4) with (2, 5).

> ⑷ **Step 3.** Depending on the result of **Step 2**, use the following different strategies.

>> ① In case (1, 4) > (2, 5): The combinations of heavy balls are only (1, 4, **5** ), (1, 4, 6), ( **3** , 4, 6), so compare ball 3 with ball 5.

>>> ○ 3 > 5: (3, 4, 6) is the heavy set

>>> ○ 3 = 5: (1, 4, 6) is the heavy set

>>> ○ 3 < 5: (1, 4, 5) is the heavy set

>> ② In case (1, 4) < (2, 5): The combinations of heavy balls are only (2, **4** , 5), (2, 5, 6), ( **3** , 5, 6), so compare ball 3 with ball 4.

>>> ○ 3 > 4: (3, 5, 6) is the heavy set

>>> ○ 3 = 4: (2, 5, 6) is the heavy set

>>> ○ 3 < 4: (2, 4, 5) is the heavy set

>> ③ In case (1, 4) = (2, 5): The combinations of heavy balls are (2, 4, 6), (3, 4, 5), (1, 5, 6), (4, 5, 6), so it is impossible to uniquely decide them with one comparison by the pigeonhole principle. ( **Failure** )

Such codes were completed on ChatGPT 4.0, starting from simple cases to generalization (cf. low-dimension → high-dimension). Even if only such history is provided to ChatGPT, it's expected that similar trials-and-errors can be performed to establish a final problem-solving strategy for similar types of problems. As if several [LLMs](https://jb243.github.io/pages/325) like ChatGPT combined into a [cascaded control circuit](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1909) could become an AI that generates hypotheses (strategies).

One of the seven major mathematical problems, the P vs NP problem implies that 'generalizing the solving of mathematical problems' can also be a mathematical problem. With the overwhelming performance of ChatGPT and [prompt engineering](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2317) available now, if a general methodology for solving mathematical problems (i.e., a suitable open/closed serial/parallel control circuit) can be established, the implementation of hypothesis-generating AI, strategy-generating AI may not be far off. To build such a general methodology, it's necessary to understand how our collective intelligence has been organized, and that aligns with the path I want to pursue.

However, a drawback of the above solution is its obsession with covering all possible cases. AlphaGo overcame the pattern of placing the next move in Go, a game with overwhelmingly many possibilities, and AlphaFold2 and RFDiffusion were able to create high-performance AIs by significantly reducing model complexity based on biophysics background knowledge. To create hypotheses more intelligently, it seems necessary to present ways not to obsess over all possible cases from the early stages.

Just about two months after writing this, on December 14th, a paper by Google DeepMind was published in the journal Nature. The paper argued that by skillfully integrating large language models (LLMs), it is possible to create new knowledge, going beyond merely matching patterns with existing knowledge.

**FunSearch: A Model by DeepMind for Creating New Knowledge**

- **Overview:** Introduces FunSearch, a function for creating new knowledge (i.e., searching in the function space).
  
- **Principle:** Evolutionary learning

- **Composition:** LLMs are used as components to propose creative ideas. An evaluator is included to prevent hallucination (the generation of false knowledge).

- **Performance:** Presents state-of-the-art solutions to complex mathematical problems such as the cap set problem in number theory and search algorithm issues like the online bin packing problem.

In August 2024, an AI called The AI Scientist, which writes end-to-end papers by generating hypotheses, was announced. Shortly afterward, ADAS was also introduced in a similar context.
