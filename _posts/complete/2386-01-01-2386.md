## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ [Joint Probability Distribution](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1624) (Joint Probability Mass Function, Joint Probability Distribution; Coupling)

> ① Discrete Random Variables: For X =｛x<sub>1</sub>, ···, x<sub>m</sub>｝, Y =｛y<sub>1</sub>, ···, y<sub>n</sub>｝, the function π(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>) = π(X = x<sub>i</sub>, Y = y<sub>j</sub>)

> ② Continuous Random Variables: For ∂<sup>2</sup>F(x, y) / ∂x ∂y = π(x, y), the function π(x, y)

> ③ **Property 1.** π(x, y) ≥ 0

> ④ **Property 2.** ∑∑ π(x, y) = 1

## 2. **Kontorovich's problem**

⑴ **Definition**: Given the probability distribution of X (i.e., πX), the probability distribution of Y (i.e., πY), and the cost function (i.e., c(x, y)), the problem is to find the joint probability distribution π that minimizes the expected cost.

> ① X is called the source, Y the target.

**Figure 1.** Kontorovich's problem

<br>

⑵ **Assumption**: There must exist a functional relationship between X and Y ( **∵** for π(x, y) to have practical significance)

⑶ Instead of πX, conditions like {x1, x2, ···, xn} may be given (but πX=x1 = πX=x2 = ··· = πX=xn)

⑷ Example: Problem of pairing {x1, x2, ···, xn} and {y1, y2, ···, yn} in a close manner.

⑸ Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality (KD) problem is merely a modification of the above definition.

## 3. Optimal Transport Plan

⑴ Definition: The solution to Kontorovich's problem, forming a convex set

<br>

<br>

⑵ Existence of Solution: Always exists under **mild conditions** like lower semicontinuous

⑶ Methods to find the solution

> ① North West Corner Method

> ② Vogel's Approximation Method

> ③ Least-Cost Method

> ④ Various Numerical Analysis Techniques

⑷ **Example 1.** Deciding how to distribute resources when demand and supply are fixed

## **4. Wasserstein Distance**

⑴ The expected value of the cost function in a special Kontorovich's problem scenario where the cost function c(x, y) is the Euclidean distance d(x, y)

> ① Resulting in the expected value of a distance with the same unit as the distance

> ② Measuring how much the shape of a pile of sand changes when moved from one place to another, which is exactly the Wasserstein distance

<br>

⑵ Can also measure the distance between two sample groups in different metric spaces

> ① Example: When X is a set of 2D data points, and Y is a set of 3D data points

⑶ Example: WGAN (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Neural Network)

<br>

<br>

## **5. Applications**

⑴ **Application 1.** p-th order Wasserstein distance: Using the p-th moment (p-th moment, p ≥ 1) and then raising it to the power of 1/p to produce the expected value of a distance with the same unit as Euclidean distance.

<br>

⑵ **Application 2.** Partial Wasserstein Distance: Calculating the Wasserstein distance using only part of X and Y

> ① **Example 1.** Generate X = {x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ···, x<sub>n</sub>}, Y = {y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, ···, y<sub>n</sub>} as an example, and calculate the 2D-partial Wasserstein distance ([ref](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/unbalanced-partial/plot_partial_wass_and_gromov.html))

⑶ **Application 3.** Entropic Wasserstein Distance: Incorporating product measure (i.e., X ⊗ Y), [Relative Entropy](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2145)(Kullback-Leibler divergence)

<br>

> ① Entropic Wasserstein distance is also known as Sinkhorn divergence

> ② **Advantage 1.** Makes Kontorovich's problem differentiable, allowing the use of gradient-based optimization methods

> ③ **Advantage 2.** Introduces 𝝐 to provide flexibility in adjusting the optimal transport plan

⑷ **Application 4.** [Robust Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06297.pdf): Using cλ(x, y) = min { c(x, y), 2λ } instead of c(x, y)

⑸ **Application 5.** Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm: By normalizing the cost function, it enables ultra-fast optimization in optimal transport.

⑹ **Application 6.** collective OT (COT): A technique that simultaneously optimizes optimal transport across multiple pairs. (e.g., [COMMOT](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01728-4))
