>> ○ It is important to note that top schools like Harvard and Stanford are known for releasing their decline results quite late.

>> ○ The shape of the function closely resembles a 4PL regression curve.

> ○ Trends of decline over time by research direction (spatiotemporal omics vs spatial bioinformatics).

## 2. Study Abroad Success Story

 ○ Ultimately, the SOP should contain content related to the big question.

> ○ Like a bold entrepreneur exciting people's minds, it's desirable for the SOP to contain a future scientific vision that moves the professors' hearts.

> ○ However, emphasizing even excellent skills in techniques like Western Blotting from decades ago will only have a counterproductive effect.

> ○ Therefore, it's important to assert the determination to complete this conception rather than emphasizing being a typical Asian who listens well.

> ○ Nevertheless, being too bold may backfire, so maintaining an appropriate stance is crucial.

> ○ The safest option is to select a future trend that resonates with many professors, referencing historical and current technological advancements.

> ○ In the author's case, envisioning a future where spatiotemporal omics is standard technology across red, white, and green bio realms.

 ○ Impressions of Each Program

> ○ **UCLA BMSB:** Feels like a field that requires a lot of soft knowledge even within dry-lab work. Biochem and chemoinformatics seem strong, possibly due to the presence of global pharmaceutical companies in California where UCs are located. However, the lack of visible stipends may be related to the low funding within UCs and the student protests within UCs during the 2023-2024 admissions.

> ○ **UMich Bioinformatics:** Graduation typically takes 3 to 5 years, but for master's degree holders, it seems to be around 3 to 4 years. Some PIs aim to graduate students in just 3 years. Fields like information theory require a lot of hard knowledge even within dry-lab work. However, there are efforts to increase the survivability of BI departments by establishing wet-labs for independent data production. Tuition fee full funding + ~40k USD/yr. It's puzzling to be accepted given the scarcity of international students during the PhD.

> ○ **GT Bioinformatics:** Looking at graduates' career paths, it seems that GT has better FAANG employment prospects than UMich (including not only CS but also Bioinformatics programs). Although there were rumors of lower stipends, the author received full tuition funding + ~40k USD/yr stipend. Applied to both CS and BME for bioinformatics, as the degree eventually appears as bioinformatics, calling it duplicate application. BME seems to be jointly operated with Emory University, located nearby. There are many international students.

> ○ **Sloan Kettering Institute Cancer Engineering:** When visiting Sloan, connected with Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell, saw the forefront of bioengineering research. For example, research on using different fluorescent labels on transcription factors (TFs) and using light interference and FRET to visualize the spatial and temporal distance between TFs. Such fields that can fill one universe seem to be recent trends, and it seems that becoming a PI in the BME field requires such efforts. Computational tracks are abundant, but it feels like 80% wet-lab + 20% dry-lab. Considering the cost of living in New York City, has a tuition fee full funding + ~50k USD/yr stipend, like Columbia University.

> ○ **UW-Madison Medical Physics:** Program centered around imaging/nuclear medicine such as PET, MRI, and US. Admission is by direct admit, and if the applicant has already found a compatible PI, the interview process, which the applicant needs to arrange with the PI, can be easily resolved. Although the author did not attend this program, it seems that contacted PIs diligently help find other PIs suitable for the applicant, making the interview process seem guaranteed for acceptance.

○ 'Opportunities' come cruelly disguised as 'failures'. What did you gain and learn from the failures you unexpectedly encountered?

> ○ One step forward from now on. I realize there are plenty of things I want to do in the future.

> ○ Existential awakening. I feel like I could be happy even if I were stranded on a desert island with only paper and pen. Therefore, I declare that I will not seek inner peace from people.

> ○ I want to live a fiercely intense life beyond imagination. I want to strive to be seen by the giants who move the world. My mind will never rest for even a week. How harsh and lonely will that process be for me? Nevertheless, I will boil even more. It's reminiscent of a phrase from Trump.

○ `The reason I chose Michigan`

> ○ While attending AACR 2024, I had the opportunity to meet professors like Aviv Regev, Christina Curtis, Dana Pe'er, Sanja Vickovic, and Joakim Lundeberg. From their lectures, I learned that spatial biology has the potential to revolutionize the entire pharmaceutical industry. Michigan stood out as the best place to further my studies in what I believe to be the next phase of spatial biology.

## **3. Future Plans**

 ○ **Regarding Direction**

> ○ During the study abroad application period, I thought about UCLA, but life doesn't flow according to the initial direction set, much like human relationships. It's as if first love never comes true.

> ○ However, 'direction' gives momentum, and the actual direction of life tends to be somewhat similar to the initial direction.

 ○ **Why I Benefit Others**

> ○ There was once a person who had many dreams but couldn't fully realize their potential due to the difficulties of reality. However, that person thirsted for success, so I guided them on the path of studying abroad. In the end, that person entered a master's program, received full funding, and transferred to a doctoral program within a year. It was reported that they would work as an intern software engineer at Amazon while in graduate school.

> ○ Giving someone who has lost their dreams a life to look forward to tomorrow. I just want to do that because it looks good, and I want to give hope to those who have lost hope.

○ **Industry**

> ○ **Regarding Industry**

>> ○ The lifetime expected earnings in the US job market are several times higher than other career paths.

>> ○ It is considered strategic to experience the big tech industry, regardless of the path one chooses.

>> ○ The recent rise in attention to astrobiology is ultimately because this field has become scalable and automated with high-throughput. Now, academia and industry are inseparable.

> ○ **Direction 1:** I started thinking about working at a company called [xAI](https://x.ai/) founded by Elon Musk.

>> ○ Reason: Contemplating sustainable AI industries. The existential threat of AI has clearly approached reality.

>> ○ Evaluation: A newly launched startup with only 8 to 10 employees currently. It is expected to grow to dozens to hundreds of employees in about four years. With the motto 'Understand the Universe,' I feel like I'll meet people similar to me.

>> ○ Prediction: It is predicted that AI big tech will become a three-way battle among three companies: Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and X.ai. However, Google DeepMind and OpenAI have not yet provided appropriate answers to the coexistence of AI and humanity. ([ref](https://www.chosun.com/economy/tech_it/2024/02/20/255TBSQENRB2NNAR2LLM772YSM/))

> ○ **Direction 2:** Global pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Moderna, etc.: There is high demand for bioinformaticians.

 ○ **Academia**

> ○ Regarding Academia

>> ○ It seems quite valuable to aim to become a person who is not only a master in academia but also holds significant social influence.

>> ○ Seeing researchers from SciLifeLab, who developed Visium, become professors at Stanford, Columbia University, and others, I realize that developing substantial technologies that can change the era is a prerequisite to becoming a professor at top-tier schools.

> ○ **Direction 1:** Academic-style Postdoc: Direction towards prestigious universities like Harvard, Stanford, etc.

> ○ **Direction 2:** Laboratory-style Postdoc: Allen Institute, Broad Institute, Sanger Institute, Francis Crick Institute, etc.

> ○ **Direction 3:** Corporate-style Postdoc: IT includes Amazon; bio includes pharmaceutical companies like the Novartis Innovation Postdoctoral Fellowship Program.

> ○ Example of recruitment/postdoc/professorship notices

>> ○ [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/about/careers/job/4907567)

>> ○ [CancerCareers.org](https://www.cancercareers.org/)

>> ○ [Stellenangebote de ETH Zürich](https://jobs.ethz.ch/site/index)

>> ○ [ETH get hired](https://eth-gethired.ch/de/jobs/)

>> ○ [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en/om/work-at-kth/lediga-jobb)

 ○ **Business**

> ○ Eventually, I might have to become someone who creates tens of thousands of high-paying jobs. Moreover, there aren't many people in South Korea who can do that.

> ○ The industrial upheaval caused by AI is faster than I thought. Therefore, I want to create industries of macroscopic scale that cannot be easily applied by AI, creating many jobs that cannot be replaced by AI.

 ○ **Politics**

> ○ **Contradictions in Politics:** This is a space for writing about the contradictions in the world that I would like to change rather than a desire to become a politician.

> ○ **Low Birth Rate:** A number as extreme as a quarterly birth rate of 0.6, which could only be seen in extreme wartime situations, has emerged. This is the most difficult math problem I have ever seen. To solve it, I am contemplating and planning the following solutions.

>> ○ Deploying AI and robots to significantly reduce labor demand.

>> ○ Attracting core industries to increase high-quality jobs.

>> ○ Making all advanced knowledge public to reduce lifelong education costs and promote individuals' social advancement. In particular, the reluctance of women in the metropolitan area and with high education to marry and have children seems to be related to delayed social advancement and career interruptions.

>> ○ Suppressing dating and marriage and popularizing arranged marriages. If the timing of social advancement is delayed and the age of marriage is postponed, then one can simply refrain from dating.

>> ○ Other immigration policies, childcare policies, women's policies, etc., will likely fall within the jurisdiction of administrators rather than scholars.

> ○ **Innovative Industries:** The emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT implies that almost all industries can be automated in the future. Industries that cannot be replaced by AI in the future should be high-context industries with large scale. These industries can create tens of thousands of high-paying jobs and are ideal industries where high-wage and low-wage workers coexist. I diagnose as follows. Note that once full automation is achieved, the IT industry will find it difficult to remain an independent industry.

>> ○ **Bio:** Mainly pharmaceutical development. Pharmaceuticals are much larger in the market than food and cosmetics. Even Orion, a chocolate pie company, now makes pharmaceuticals! ([ref](https://n.news.naver.com/article/015/0004937081?cds=news_edit))

>> ○ **Quantum:** Quantum computing, quantum communication, nuclear fusion, etc.

>> ○ **Space:** [SpaceX](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1075) and others.

>> ○ **Environment:** The only potential innovative industry that has not yet been industrialized. What I want to do is to combine bio, IT, and the environment into one. ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/315))

> ○ Additionally,

>> ○ OECD suicide rate ranked first.

>> ○ Political polarization: Since polarization is severe even in the United States, it is not a problem unique to South Korea. Switzerland is worth referring to, as Switzerland achieved political stability because it was surrounded by the Himalayas and was not invaded by foreign powers.
