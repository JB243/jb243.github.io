(Related to the question below)

> ○ To avoid the assumption of i.i.d., is it possible to do statistical analysis based on the simulation of the world?

> ○ There are quite a few people with the same number of hairs according to the pigeon-hole principle. Are there any other unexpected results obtained using the pigeon-hole principle?

> ○ The reason why there are few combinatorial theories is because the field itself is not profound or has not been studied sufficiently?

> ○ How should we analyze the statistical significance provided by spatial continuity? (Spatial Statistics) For example, if a certain spot A is too far away from other A spots, there is a high probability that this spot is not actually an A spot.

> ○ In relation to the continuum hypothesis, could the infinity mentioned in the [St. Petersburg paradox](https://nate9389.tistory.com/645#:~:text=St.%20Petersburg%20paradox) be the weakest form of infinity—merely in the sense of being non-convergent?

## **2. Physics**

#### **2-1. Dynamics**

> ○ Is there a formula of the speed of movement when the fire moves through the lamp wick?

> ○ The reason why the coefficient of kinetic friction is smaller than the coefficient of static friction. 

<br>

#### **2-2. Transfer Phenomena**

> ○ Why does a golf ball with a groove on the surface fly more?

>> **➜ In the case of a smooth ball, when the ball moves at the right speed, the boundary layer is separated from the middle of the ball. At this time, from the middle of the ball, the speed of the air rapidly decreases, and at the same time, the direction of the airflow changes to form a circulation flow. In this case, high pressure is applied on the front side of the ball and low pressure on the back side, resulting in a large morphological resistance. On the other hand, in the case of a grooved ball, turbulent flow occurs on the front surface of the ball, and thus separation and circulation of the boundary layer become much smaller. This reduces the resistance of the ball.**

> ○ Why a ceramic dish doesn’t easily break when you hammer a nail underwater

>> **➜ Because the water’s resistance (viscosity) greatly slows the hammer and nail, and the water also disperses and cushions the impact, reducing local stress concentration.**

> ○ The reason why the wind blows hard when you pass through the door when the temperature difference is large.

> ○ Why does the pressure in the train going through the tunnel decrease?

> ○ The reason why a cap of a bottle keeps vibrating when the cap is closed not completely.

<br>

#### **2-4. Electromagnetics**

> ○ Can nanorobots be used for treatment by applying exterior magnetic fields?

>> **➜** **It's been implemented already in [DGIST](https://www.dgist.ac.kr/kr/html/sub06/060102.html?mode=V&no=0a1d8dc33c00b6b0aee73014e09bc1d2).** **The blood flow is fast, making it difficult to control the nanorobot, but the neural tract did not have such an issue, so the nanorobot moved along the tract.**

> ○ Is there a new substance that can remove dust using static electricity?

> ○ Relationship between [electronegativity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1328#footnote_link_67_51) of chemicals and Coulomb force.

> ○ The mosquito net looks similar to a Faraday cage. Can it be applied to electromagnetic shielding?

> ○ Is it easy to find a lost cell phone using electromagnetism?

> ○ Why does animal fur stick to clothes? Is it because of static electricity? Then wouldn't it be possible to remove the fur on your clothes if you give it an electrical stimulus?

> ○ The magnetic field around an electric pad is 10 G, which is smaller than the Earth's magnetic field of 40 G. But why does a neodymium magnet vibrate around the electric pad?

> ○ Why does a thin wire split into beads when a 220 V voltage is applied to it? And what is the reason that such a steel ball falls toward a certain part of the electric pad?

<br>

#### **2-5. Optics**

> ○ Is it possible to create an impressive visualization by properly positioning mirrors?

> ○ What is the exact mathematical formula to illustrate Tyndall phenomenon? Wouldn't it be possible to implement a hologram using this formula?

<br>

#### **2-6. Modern Physics**

> ○ Maxwell argued that light is an electromagnetic wave by showing the speed of an electromagnetic wave is c. However, in particle physics, particles with a speed of c are not only photons. Are real photons that make up observable light and virtual photons, which are [gauge bosons](https://jb243.github.io/pages/191) that mediate electromagnetic force, the same?

>> **➜ [Cherenkov emission or Cherenkov radiation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2130#A1) reveals that virtual photons can also be real photons.**

> ○ Why is the theory of relativity limited to speed (special) and acceleration (general)? What about functions with dimensions greater than acceleration?

>> **➜ There are 4 forces in Physics and there is something in common that all of these forces are inversely proportional to the square of the distance according to the field theory and are limited to acceleration. In light of these commonalities, it is thought that 4 forces are ultimately governed by one principle (related to the great unification theory) and it appears that our universe has 'regulated' to limit the order of motion of objects to acceleration (related to multiverse cosmology). This is why relativity theory is limited to acceleration, and the reason why objects around us do not appear to be limited to acceleration is that the tendency is obscured by complex system phenomena.**

> ○ Why does the universe exist?

>> **➜ Frank Wilczek, the Nobel laureate in physics, argued as follows: "Just as water can exist in liquid or solid form, the universe can exist in various states. ... The highly symmetric state where everything is composed of energy is unstable, so the universe exists in a less symmetric state where matter is present."**

> ○ Let's say the wave is passing through one medium. If the medium suddenly moves perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels, how will the direction of the wave change? Perhaps mechanical waves do not change their direction at all, but what about light?

> ○ Can the energy of reflected light and the energy of refracted light be interpreted as the principle of Huygens?

> ○ Is it possible to teleport outer space into another space by folding space?

<br>

> ○ How can we determine the spatiotemporal structural changes of entities such as antigens, antibodies, and viruses?

>> **➜ Methods such as [NMR relaxation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/972) dispersion, cryo-EM, and crystallography are employed for this purpose.**

> ○ Levinthal’s paradox (1969) highlights that if protein folding is treated as an exhaustive search for the lowest free-energy state over all possible backbone conformations, it becomes computationally infeasible. Even assuming only three allowed states for each φ, ψ dihedral pair, a 100-residue protein would have 3<sup>2×100</sup> = 9<sup>100</sup> ≈ 10<sup>95</sup>, making brute-force search unrealistic.

>> **➜ Deep learning–based methods such as RosettaFold and AlphaFold can efficiently explore the search space.**

> ○ Why writing made with lemon juice becomes visible when heated

>> **➜ Lemon juice contains organic acids (citric acid, vitamin C) and sugars, so it’s nearly colorless when it soaks into paper; but when heated, these components undergo oxidation, dehydration, and caramelization and brown first (they discolor at a lower temperature than the paper).**

> ○ Given a molecular weight, how can we easily derive a chemical formula? I think we can adopt ideas from the theory of integers.

> ○ The water on the bottom of a cup does not evaporate, so there may be hygiene problems. How do we solve this?

> ○ There are hundreds of chemical reactions that human use ([ref1](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2177), [ref2](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1403)). However, since there are about 3,000 genes of E.coli, the metabolic reactions used by E.coli are much more diverse. Can humanity implement all the different chemical reactions as E.coli? ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1397))

> ○ How do we secure water in a water-free environment (_e.g._ desert)?

> ○ Does saltwater (_e.g._, sweat) evaporate slower than distilled water?

> ○ Onion removes fat and garlic prevents the stomach from spoiling. How does that work?

> ○ Why are the composition of shells of clam (_i.e._, calcium carbonate) and the composition of crustaceans and arthropod skeletons (_i.e._, chitin) different?

> ○ Why is it easier for humans to recognize two dimensions than three dimensions?

>> **➜ The world is three-dimensional, and the first dimension is consumed in the process of forming an image on the retina through the pupil.**

> ○ What factors determine your voice besides your physicals?

>> **➜ The trembling of the vocal cords is the voice, so the thickness and arrangement of the muscles are important.**

> ○ Why is it difficult to do repetitive things when you try to do them without thinking about them? For example, if you think, "how am I doing this?", you can't do what you've been doing repeatedly.

>> **➜ Because the cerebellum is trying to do what the cerebellum was doing well.**

> ○ Why does exercise suppress digestion? 

>> **➜ The sympathetic nerves that are activated by exercise inhibit the digestive activity**

> ○ Why is your body tired if you use your brain a lot?

>> **➜ Glucose can pass BBB and it is quickly absorbed by neurons expressing GLUT1. After that, the glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, and the cytoplasmic NADH is rapidly transferred to the mitochondrial inner membrane electron system by a glycerol-phosphate shuttle. If you try to use your brain faster than usual, lactic acid fermentation occurs as you try to produce energy even when the electron transport system is not sufficiently restored. Lactic acid is the main cause of fatigue. The brain uses 20% of the total oxygen consumption, so lactic acid fatigue will be considerable. And the lactic acid is known to be excreted out of the brain during the break.**

> ○ Can we make a real-time blood pressure monitor?

>> **➜** **It has been implemented in smartwatches such as the Mi watch.**

> ○ What is the scientific meaning of the word "blood boiling"?

>> **➜ Sympathetic nerves become active, and in this case, heart rate increases, vessel contracts, and blood pressure increases, giving the feeling of blood boiling.**

> ○ Why do we age faster when under stress?

>> **➜ The adrenal glands are among the organs in the body with the highest levels of vitamin C. When stressed, they secrete large amounts of adrenal hormones, such as glucocorticoids and epinephrine, which can deplete the body's vitamin C. When vitamin C is depleted, antioxidant activity decreases, accelerating aging caused by reactive oxygen species.**

> ○ Why do we notice right before we die?

>> **➜ This is due to the body's inability to accept death and the excessive secretion of adrenaline. At this point, one experiences a sudden feeling of being healthy. ([ref](https://youtube.com/shorts/E14Qe1QQrnI?si=cyyibqYDs5PB0fT6))**

> ○ Is there any special reason or coincidence that Putin only has daughters and Musk only has sons? For similar examples, there were especially many queens in the Silla period in the Republic of Korea, Queen Elizabeth's family had many women, Lim Chang-Jung had only 5 sons even if his wives were different, and surgeons are likely to have daughters. For a slightly different example, parents of twins are likely to have twins again.

>> **➜ The female reproductive environment and certain genetic factors are involved, and this tendency becomes more pronounced when the mother gives birth to her first child at a later age. ([ref](https://www.chosun.com/culture-life/health/2025/09/13/ECILHUDSRJDF7EPOAS3H3RS7BQ/))**

> ○ Is your first breath right after birth inhale or exhale?

> ○ Does alcohol cause muscle loss?

> ○ It is widely accepted that the reason why vision deteriorates as people get older is that there is a factor that makes the lens thicker in modern society. However, some people say that as the brain capacity increases as we grows, the head grows back and forth, the retina moves back, and the image forms in front of the retina. The increase in brain capacity is a phenomenon that occurred with the evolution of mankind, and primitive humans must have increased brain capacity. If vision deteriorates due to increased brain capacity, it will be fatal to the survival of primitive humans. Thus, wasn't the mid-to-late teens by which vision didn't deteriorate the lifespan of primitive people?

> ○ Does exercising make the diuretic effect more active just as the sweating effect becomes active? If so, the mechanism of the active diuretic effect would be related to the increased blood pressure.

> ○ It is well known that boys are born 1.05 times more than girls. Is it because having XX chromosomes is more likely to develop chromosomal mutations than having XY chromosomes before birth?

> ○ What is the best antibiotic at the present?

>> **➜ Antiobiotics have antibacterial activity in two main ways. One class interferes with cell wall synthesis and the other class inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Penicilin is included to the former and streptomycin to the latter. Therefore, penicilin streptomycin (PS), which is used as an antibiotic in cell experiments, blocks bacterial quite comprehensively. Plus, too good antibiotics can make super bacteria, so the FDA subsidizes sellers and prevents them from being sold on a market. It's because of later imperative uses.**

## **5. Earth Science** 

> ○ What is the one thing we need the most if we go to the desert? (Interview) 

>> **➜ It can be explained by dividing it into objects to protect us and objects to improve deserts. In the desert, albedo is considerably higher than forest and sea, so physical damage due to light is expected. For example, strong light can cause blindness and skin cancer, so we should take sunglasses and sunscreen. Also, water to prevent dehydration, nutritional supplements to prevent exhaustion, and safety equipment to prevent loss of feet are needed. However, these measures are short-term and what is really needed is long-term measure. To improve deserts, living organisms with strong vitality and high moisture content such as moss and fungi should be dominant species. In addition, it is possible to modify the land's microorganisms to be moisture-friendly species (_e.g._, E.coli).**

>> **➜ I aim to suggest an answer to this issue in the form of [a sci-fi novel](https://nate9389.tistory.com/315).**

> ○ What industry will emerge when mankind reaches Mars?

>> **➜ It is important to exploit resources on Mars, and it seems more realistic to transport organic materials than heavy metals by spaceships. Organic material can be used as food, but it can also be used an energy source. Energy source is important because it can be sold on Earth or used for spaceships otself. In order to realize such agriculture, completely unmanned agriculture and plants growing on Mars will be a hot topic.**

> ○ Does a macroscopic system like the Earth also possess advanced cognitive functions?

> ○ Can we make a device that imitates the skeleton of an insect?

> ○ Can we make a machine that can stick to the ceiling like a fly? Drones are not recommended because they consume a lot of energy.

<br>

#### **6-7. [Medical device](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1202)**

> ○ Can imaging medical devices such as MRI be used as a treatment platform?

> ○ Fitness sensor for pregnant women?

> ○ Can't we make a partial MRI to check the degree of sprained leg and the progress of recovery?

> ○ Is there an invention that prevents your feet from getting sweaty?

<br>
<br>

## **7. Assistive and Appropriate Technology**

> ○ Is it possible to make a calculator for the blind?

> ○ A technology that allows the disabled to play soccer by making virtual feet, so that they can play soccer without legs. Wouldn't it be possible to implement it in virtual reality?

> ○ Wouldn't it be possible to make braille devices for the blind if we make braille protrusions with the rotational force of the motor?

> ○ Wouldn't it be possible to contribute to wheelchair soccer for the disabled if a protruding device is made with the rotational force of the motor?

> ○ Can't braille display for some device buttons be applied in daily life? Icon T-shirts, microphone shapes, etc.

## **8. Environment**

> ○ What is the solution to the Pacific garbage island? Wouldn't this problem be solved easily if we looked at the Pacific garbage island as an ownerless natural resource?

>> **➜ I suggested an answer for this question in the form of [a science fiction novel](https://jb243.github.io/pages/315).**

> ○ Vinyl for umbrella cover is provided before entering the room on a rainy day. The amount of garbage in this plastic bag is enormous. Can't we replace it with other ingredients?

> ○ Can't the objects around the trash can be clean?

> ○ It is known that the coordination of heavy metals with [chelators](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1354#:~:text=%E2%91%B6-,%ED%82%AC%EB%A0%88%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8,-%3A%20%EC%97%AC%EB%9F%AC%20%EC%9E%90%EB%A6%AC%EC%97%90) greatly reduces toxicity in vivo. It is also known that the radioisotopes loaded in the nanoparticles have less leakage radiation due to the shielding effect of the nanoparticles. Then, how about using chelators and nanoparticles to decontaminate radiation waste?
