> ○ If **X1** and **X2** are statistically different, are log **X1** and log **X2** also statistically different? Of course, it would be different, which would mean that the significance of statistical analysis is inconsistent and somewhat arbitrary. Then, what is the most universally valid statistical analysis? (Related to the question below)

> ○ To avoid the assumption of i.i.d., is it possible to do statistical analysis based on the simulation of the world?

> ○ There are quite a few people with the same number of hairs according to the pigeon-hole principle. Are there any other unexpected results obtained using the pigeon-hole principle?

> ○ The reason why there are few combinatorial theories is because the field itself is not profound or has not been studied sufficiently?

> ○ How should we analyze the statistical significance provided by spatial continuity? (Spatial Statistics) For example, if a certain spot A is too far away from other A spots, there is a high probability that this spot is not actually an A spot.

## **2. Physics**

#### **2-1. Dynamics**

> ○ Is there a formula of the speed of movement when the fire moves through the lamp wick?

> ○ The reason why the coefficient of kinetic friction is smaller than the coefficient of static friction. 

<br>

#### **2-2. Transfer Phenomena**

> ○ Why does a golf ball with a groove on the surface fly more?

>> **➜ In the case of a smooth ball, when the ball moves at the right speed, the boundary layer is separated from the middle of the ball. At this time, from the middle of the ball, the speed of the air rapidly decreases, and at the same time, the direction of the airflow changes to form a circulation flow. In this case, high pressure is applied on the front side of the ball and low pressure on the back side, resulting in a large morphological resistance. On the other hand, in the case of a grooved ball, turbulent flow occurs on the front surface of the ball, and thus separation and circulation of the boundary layer become much smaller. This reduces the resistance of the ball.**

> ○ Is there a new substance that can remove dust using static electricity?

> ○ Relationship between [electronegativity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1328#footnote_link_67_51) of chemicals and Coulomb force.

> ○ Maxwell argued that light is an electromagnetic wave by showing the speed of an electromagnetic wave is c. However, in particle physics, particles with a speed of c are not only photons. Are real photons that make up observable light and virtual photons, which are [gauge bosons](https://jb243.github.io/pages/191) that mediate electromagnetic force, the same?

>> **➜ [Cherenkov emission or Cherenkov radiation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2130#A1) reveals that virtual photons can also be real photons.**

> ○ Why is the theory of relativity limited to speed (special) and acceleration (general)? What about functions with dimensions greater than acceleration?

>> **➜ There are 4 forces in Physics and there is something in common that all of these forces are inversely proportional to the square of the distance according to the field theory and are limited to acceleration. In light of these commonalities, it is thought that 4 forces are ultimately governed by one principle (related to the great unification theory) and it appears that our universe has 'regulated' to limit the order of motion of objects to acceleration (related to multiverse cosmology). This is why relativity theory is limited to acceleration, and the reason why objects around us do not appear to be limited to acceleration is that the tendency is obscured by complex system phenomena.**

> ○ Why does the universe exist?

>> **➜ Frank Wilczek, the Nobel laureate in physics, argued as follows: "Just as water can exist in liquid or solid form, the universe can exist in various states. ... The highly symmetric state where everything is composed of energy is unstable, so the universe exists in a less symmetric state where matter is present."**

> ○ Let's say the wave is passing through one medium. If the medium suddenly moves perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels, how will the direction of the wave change? Perhaps mechanical waves do not change their direction at all, but what about light?

> ○ Is it possible to teleport outer space into another space by folding space?

<br>

> ○ How can we determine the spatiotemporal structural changes of entities such as antigens, antibodies, and viruses?

>> **➜ Methods such as [NMR relaxation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/972) dispersion, cryo-EM, and crystallography are employed for this purpose.**

> ○ Why does exercise suppress digestion? 

>> **➜ The sympathetic nerves that are activated by exercise inhibit the digestive activity**

> ○ Why is your body tired if you use your brain a lot?

>> **➜ Glucose can pass BBB and it is quickly absorbed by neurons expressing GLUT1. After that, the glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, and the cytoplasmic NADH is rapidly transferred to the mitochondrial inner membrane electron system by a glycerol-phosphate shuttle. If you try to use your brain faster than usual, lactic acid fermentation occurs as you try to produce energy even when the electron transport system is not sufficiently restored. Lactic acid is the main cause of fatigue. The brain uses 20% of the total oxygen consumption, so lactic acid fatigue will be considerable. And the lactic acid is known to be excreted out of the brain during the break.**

> ○ Can we make a real-time blood pressure monitor?

>> **➜** **It has been implemented in smartwatches such as the Mi watch.**

> ○ What is the scientific meaning of the word "blood boiling"?

>> **➜ Sympathetic nerves become active, and in this case, heart rate increases, vessel contracts, and blood pressure increases, giving the feeling of blood boiling.**

> ○ Why do we age faster when under stress?

>> **➜ The adrenal glands are among the organs in the body with the highest levels of vitamin C. When stressed, they secrete large amounts of adrenal hormones, such as glucocorticoids and epinephrine, which can deplete the body's vitamin C. When vitamin C is depleted, antioxidant activity decreases, accelerating aging caused by reactive oxygen species.**

> ○ Can people fix their eyesight without surgery?

> ○ Is there a relationship between bone sound and growth stage?

> ○ Is there a case where the secretory duct does not secrete directly into the secretory site and sends it out through the skin?

> ○ When you pee after eating food, the color is different, but what are the reason and tendencies?

> ○ Is your first breath right after birth inhale or exhale?

> ○ Does alcohol cause muscle loss?

> ○ It is widely accepted that the reason why vision deteriorates as people get older is that there is a factor that makes the lens thicker in modern society. However, some people say that as the brain capacity increases as we grows, the head grows back and forth, the retina moves back, and the image forms in front of the retina. The increase in brain capacity is a phenomenon that occurred with the evolution of mankind, and primitive humans must have increased brain capacity. If vision deteriorates due to increased brain capacity, it will be fatal to the survival of primitive humans. Thus, wasn't the mid-to-late teens by which vision didn't deteriorate the lifespan of primitive people?

> ○ Does exercising make the diuretic effect more active just as the sweating effect becomes active? If so, the mechanism of the active diuretic effect would be related to the increased blood pressure.

> ○ It is well known that boys are born 1.05 times more than girls. Is it because having XX chromosomes is more likely to develop chromosomal mutations than having XY chromosomes before birth?

#### **4-5. Microbiome**

> ○ What is the best antibiotic at the present?

>> **➜ Antiobiotics have antibacterial activity in two main ways. One class interferes with cell wall synthesis and the other class inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Penicilin is included to the former and streptomycin to the latter. Therefore, penicilin streptomycin (PS), which is used as an antibiotic in cell experiments, blocks bacterial quite comprehensively. Plus, too good antibiotics can make super bacteria, so the FDA subsidizes sellers and prevents them from being sold on a market. It's because of later imperative uses.**

> ○ Why is the anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage peripheral to the tumor? What are the benefits of cancer cells and M2 macrophages?

>> **➜ Tumors secrete chemicals that induce angiogenesis so that blood vessels grow into tumors.

<br>

#### **4-8. Bioinformatics**

> ○ Are 3D genomics and 3D transcriptomics possible?

>> **➜ In 2020, 2D spatial-resolved transcriptomics was selected as the Method of the Year in Nature, and soon [a paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abb3446?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) has been reported that built a 3D spatial transcriptomics by stacking the 2D spatial transcriptomics of the mouse brain. It seems that it is not far away to create commercialized artificial organs (organoids) by combining this transcriptomics-wide information with 3D printing.**

>> **➜ In July 2023, the 3D MERFISH [research](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.21.550124v1) was announced.** MERFISH can also obtain count values along the z-axis for thick tissues.**

>> **➜ In November 2024, [3D spatial transcriptomics (ST)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn9947) was implemented using tissue clearing and multiplexing.**

>> **➜ In May 2025, the [3D genome/transcriptome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02613-z) was reconstructed using DNA microscopy. This required mathematical operations such as diffusion laws, the Boltzmann distribution, and eigenvectors.**

>> **➜ In May 2023, studies measuring spatial heterogeneity with connectivity index, Shannon entropy, Simpson index, and cluster modularity based on spatial transcriptomics have been introduced. ([ref1](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-023-01185-4#Sec2), [ref2](https://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/fulltext/S0167-7799(21)00267-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0167779921002675%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)) Note that heterogeneity studies in scRNA-seq have already been introduced.

> ○ Does humans store information not only through the brain that takes a deep learning strategy but also other organs through the structure itself? This is because it has complexity and heterogeneity that cannot be explained purely by DNA. And information on learning organs will be given from the environment. As deep learning has considerable learning power because it gives each node a degree of freedom, wouldn't biology give a degree of freedom to each cell type?

> ○ According to the central dogma, DNA, RNA, and protein are the basic principles of life, but DNA is too uniform and protein is too diverse. So shouldn't the basis of bioinformatics be RNA?

## **5. Earth Science** 

> ○ What is the one thing we need the most if we go to the desert? (Interview) 

>> **➜ It can be explained by dividing it into objects to protect us and objects to improve deserts. In the desert, albedo is considerably higher than forest and sea, so physical damage due to light is expected. For example, strong light can cause blindness and skin cancer, so we should take sunglasses and sunscreen. Also, water to prevent dehydration, nutritional supplements to prevent exhaustion, and safety equipment to prevent loss of feet are needed. However, these measures are short-term and what is really needed is long-term measure. To improve deserts, living organisms with strong vitality and high moisture content such as moss and fungi should be dominant species. In addition, it is possible to modify the land's microorganisms to be moisture-friendly species (_e.g._, E.coli).**

>> **➜ I aim to suggest an answer to this issue in the form of [a sci-fi novel](https://nate9389.tistory.com/315).**

> ○ What industry will emerge when mankind reaches Mars?

>> **➜ It is important to exploit resources on Mars, and it seems more realistic to transport organic materials than heavy metals by spaceships. Organic material can be used as food, but it can also be used an energy source. Energy source is important because it can be sold on Earth or used for spaceships otself. In order to realize such agriculture, completely unmanned agriculture and plants growing on Mars will be a hot topic.**

> ○ Does a macroscopic system like the Earth also possess advanced cognitive functions?

>> **➜ Indeed, it is known that some systems can establish deep learning-like information circuits with just simple [control systems](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1909) and non-linear activation functions, and through this, they can learn from the information provided by the environment. ([ref](https://elifesciences.org/articles/67455)) However, it is unlikely that the Earth would possess a sense of self to that extent.**

## **6. Computer Science**

#### **6-1. Algorithm**

> ○ Why can we get a clean image from the noisy image through the deep image prior (DIP) fundamentally?

>> **➜ Many people say that CNN has its own correction function, so it does not learn the given input in a strict way, but creates a flexible image that approaches the truth. But I think it's more profound than that, because it creates information that doesn't exist. For the most basic reason, it is because there are many simple and repetitive structures in nature.**
