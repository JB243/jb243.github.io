## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Definition **:** A statistical test method to determine whether the relationship between two variables, X and Y, can be better explained by stratifying based on a third variable

⑵ Null Hypothesis H0 **:** The correlation between X and Y given the strata does not differ from the correlation without the strata (conditional independence)

⑶ For example, it can be tested whether stratifying the correlation between treatment and response by age provides a more significant explanation

⑷ Strata are typically categorical data, but continuous data can be applied by binning into intervals

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Derivation**

 ⑴ Assume (X, Y) exist as N pairs of observed data

 ⑵ Assume the observed data are stratified into K strata by a third variable (e.g. **:** age) **:** Define the number of observed data in each stratum as Nk

⑶ Define the probability variables of the k-th stratum as (Xk, Yk), and represent the data in that stratum as (x1k, y1k), ···, (xNk, yNk)

⑷ Define Tk as follows

⑹ Variance of ρs **:** Can be used for statistical interval estimation

## **3\. Interpretation**

⑴ CMH Statistic or M2

> ① If M2 is sufficiently large and the p-value is low, it indicates that the correlation between the two variables differs across the strata

> ② The M2 statistic itself depends not only on the weighted correlation between variables but also on the sample size

> ③ For example, if there is no stratification, M2 = ρ2 (N-1) (where ρ is the overall Pearson correlation coefficient)

⑵ SCC (stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient) or ρs

> ① Instead of M2, ρs is used as the weighted correlation coefficient between the two variables, considering stratification

⑶ -1 ≤ ρs ≤ 1

> ① ρs = 1 **:** Perfect positive correlation

> ② ρs = -1 **:** Perfect negative correlation

> ③ ρs = 0 **:** No correlation

⑷ **Application.** [HiCRep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5668950/) **:** When evaluating the similarity between a pair of Hi-C bioinformatics data, check the distance dependency of the correlation coefficient of the contact matrix
