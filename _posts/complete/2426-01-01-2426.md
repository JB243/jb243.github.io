1. For the following matrix (A), find real numbers (a, b, c) such that (A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI). (Here, (I) is the (3 \times 3) identity matrix.)

**Solution.****

We can find the following relation.

**∴** (A^5 = A^2 \times (-3A) = (-3)^2 A), so (a = 0), (b = 9), (c = 0)

2. In 3-dimensional coordinate space, let (S) be the surface given by (4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1). Show that the surface (S) contains exactly two lines passing through the point (P(1, 2, 1)), and if the acute angle between the two lines is (\theta), find the value of (\cos \theta).

**Solution.**

(S) **:** The visualization result of (4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1) is as follows.

A line passing through (P(1, 2, 1)) can be written as ((at + 1, bt + 2, ct + 1)), (t \in \mathbb{R}), so

(4(ct + 1)^2 = (at + 1)^2 + (bt + 2)^2 - 1 \Leftrightarrow 4c^2 = a^2 + b^2) (**Equation 1**), (8c = 2a + 4b) (**Equation 2**)

To normalize ((a, b, c)), let (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1) (**Equation 3**), and since the direction vector can be taken in both directions, restrict to (c \ge 0) (**Equation 4**).

From (**Equation 1**) and (**Equation 2**), we obtain (c^2 = 1/5), and from (**Equation 4**), (c = \sqrt{1/5}).

From (a^2 + b^2 = 4/5), we can set (a = \sqrt{4/5}\cos \varphi), (b = \sqrt{4/5}\sin \varphi).

We can obtain
(2a + 4b = 2\sqrt{4/5}\cos \varphi + 4\sqrt{4/5}\sin \varphi = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{4/5})^2 + (4\sqrt{4/5})^2}\sin(\varphi+\alpha) = 4\sin(\varphi+\alpha) = 8c = 8/\sqrt{5}).

Since (4 > 8/\sqrt{5}), ((a, b, c) = (\sqrt{4/5}\cos \varphi, \sqrt{4/5}\sin \varphi, \sqrt{1/5})) **exists in exactly 2 ways**.

Now, to determine the number of solutions exactly, ignore (**Equation 3**), (**Equation 4**) introduced separately and focus only on (**Equation 1**), (**Equation 2**).

Then we can easily find ((a, b, c) = (0, 2, 1), (8, 6, 5)). (**Footnote:** If it is not easy to find, you can determine the solutions using (\varphi) and (\alpha) found above.)

Therefore, (\cos \theta) is as follows.

3. Find the real number (N) satisfying the following equation.

**Solution.**

4. Find the tens digit and the ones digit of (37^{2024}), respectively.

**Solution.**

Euler’s totient function of (100) is as follows.

Therefore, since (37) and (100) are coprime, by Euler’s theorem the following holds.

> (37^{\varphi(100)} \equiv 37^{40} \equiv 1 \pmod{100})

Therefore, the following holds.

> (37^{2024} \equiv 37^{24} = (30 + 7)^{24})

> (37^{2024} \equiv 2^{4} \times 30 \times 7^{23} + 7^{24})

> (37^{2024} \equiv 20 \times (7^{4})^{5} \times 7^{3} + (7^{4})^{6})

> (37^{2024} \equiv 20 \times 343 + 1)

> (37^{2024} \equiv 61 \pmod{100})

5. Let (f(x)) be a real function defined on all real numbers, twice differentiable, and (f''(x)) is continuous. Also, for all (x), (f'(x) > 0) and (f''(x) < 0). Prove that for any positive (t), the following holds.

**Solution.**

I referred to the official solution.

6. For real numbers (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) satisfying the two conditions below, find the following maximum value. (Assume (n \ge 3).)

**Solution.** (My solution)

At first, I attempted the following approach using a quadratic form matrix (A), but due to the condition (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 0), it was difficult to proceed further.

However, from the official solution, it is clear that it is related to [Linear Algebra](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1014).

Since the objective function and constraints are differentiable for all ((a_1, \cdots, a_n)), the maximum of the objective function is determined at a local maximum.

Let us find a local maximum using the [Lagrange multiplier method under multiple equality constraints]([https://jb243.github.io/pages/1813#:%](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1813#:%) IN%)(Lagrange multiplier).

Now, borrowing an idea from [Group Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2082)(group theory), let us understand the characteristics of (f(a, b) = \sum_i a_{i+a}a_{i+b}), which has cyclic properties under the (\sum) operation.

> ○ (f(0, 0) = 1)

> ○ (f(a, b) = f(b, a)) **:** Commutative law

> ○ (f(a+c, b+c) = f(a, b))

> ○ (f(a+c, b) = f(a-c, b))

> ○ (f(a, b+c) = f(a, b-c))

> ○ (\sum_c f(a+c, b) = 0) (**∵** ((a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2 = 0))

> ○ (\sum_c f(a, b+c) = 0) (**∵** ((a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2 = 0))

If we mark the values (f(a, b)) on an (n \times n) matrix at ((a, b)), it is (1) along the right-going diagonal direction, and the values appear symmetrically in a plus-shape about that diagonal.

Moreover, since the sum of all function values in any chosen row or column becomes (0), we may conjecture that (f) is cyclic.

Therefore, for a cyclic function (g), we can set (f(a, a \pm c) = g(2\pi c/n)), with (g(0) = 1).

According to representation theory, any real 1-dimensional representation of a finite cyclic group (an abelian group) must ultimately be expressible in the form of (\cos) or (\sin).

That is, every element of a cyclic group is expressed as a power of a fixed element, and when considering complex functions as well, (e^{i\theta}) becomes that element.

Therefore, considering (g(0) = 1), we have (f(a, a \pm c) = \cos(2\pi c/n)).

Even without using representation theory, we can reach a similar conclusion.

Even if an arbitrary function (f) is given, it can be approximated by values similar to (f(a, a \pm c) = \cos(2\pi c/n)).

But to satisfy (f(a, a) = 1), (f(a, a+1) \simeq \cos(2\pi/n)), (\cdots), (f(a, a+(n-1)) \simeq \cos(2(n-1)\pi/n)), we must determine ((a_1, \cdots, a_n)).

Since there are (n) equations and (n) variables, the solution is uniquely determined, and the previously found (f(a, a \pm c) = \cos(2\pi c/n)) is exactly that solution.

Therefore, ((\text{quasi-inequality}) \le f(a, a+1) = \cos(2\pi/n)), and the equality condition is as follows.

For reference, when (a_1 = 1/\sqrt{2}), (a_2 = -1/\sqrt{2}), (a_3 = \cdots = a_n = 0), the given conditions are satisfied, but it is not the maximum because it does not satisfy the Lagrange multiplier conditions.

**Solution.** (Official solution)

Let (V = \mathbb{C}^n), and define the linear map (\phi) **:** (V \to V) as follows.

(\phi(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) = (a_2, a_3, \cdots, a_n, a_1))

For the (n)-th root of unity (\zeta = e^{2\pi i/n} = \cos(2\pi / n) + i\sin(2\pi/n)) and (1 \le k \le n),

let (v_k = (\zeta^k, \zeta^{2k}, \cdots, \zeta^{nk})).

(For example, (v_n = (1, 1, \cdots, 1)).) Then the following holds.

> ○ (\phi(v_k) = \zeta^k v_k). That is, (v_k) is an eigenvector of (\phi) (with eigenvalue (\zeta^k)). In particular, the vectors ({v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n}) form a basis of the complex vector space (V = \mathbb{C}^n).

> ○ (v_k \cdot v_k^* = (\zeta^k, \zeta^{2k}, \cdots, \zeta^{nk}) \cdot (\zeta^{-k}, \zeta^{-2k}, \cdots, \zeta^{-nk}) = n) (where (v^*) is the complex conjugate of (v))

> ○ (j := k_1 - k_2 \ne 0 \Rightarrow v_{k_1} \cdot v_{k_2}^* = \zeta^j + \zeta^{2j} + \cdots + \zeta^{nj} = 0) (where (v^*) is the complex conjugate of (v))

Consider an arbitrary vector (v) satisfying the conditions of the problem as follows.

> ⑴ (v = (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n)

> ⑵ (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 0)

> ⑶ (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2 = 1)

Suppose the coordinate expression of (v) with respect to the basis ({v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n}) is as follows.

By condition ⑵,

By condition ⑶,

From this we obtain the following.

Now,

Since this value is real,

Therefore, the maximum of (a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + \cdots + a_{n-1}a_n + a_na_1) is (\cos(2\pi/n)), and this value is attained when

(c_2 = c_3 = \cdots = c_{n-2} = 0),

so (v) is of the form (v = c_1 v_1 + c_{n-1} v_{n-1}). In this case,

(v = c_1(\zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^n) + c_{n-1}(\zeta^*, \zeta^{*2}, \cdots, \zeta^{*n}) \in \mathbb{R}^n)

so we can see that (c_{n-1} = c_1^*). Also, since (n(|c_1|^2 + |c_{n-1}|^2) = 1),

we can see it is of the form

In particular, when (c = 1/\sqrt{2n}),

choosing

yields the maximum value (\cos(2\pi/n)).

7. For a bounded closed block region (D) on the 2-dimensional coordinate plane, suppose the boundary (\beta) of (D) satisfies the following.

⑴ (\beta) is a smooth simple closed curve.

⑵ For any point (O) on (\beta), the circle of radius (1) centered at (O) meets (\beta) at exactly two points.

⑶ The tangent line drawn at any point (O) on (\beta) does not meet (\beta) at any other point except (O).

Let (M) be the midpoint of a rod (PQ) of length (1). If we rotate the rod one full turn so that the endpoints (P, Q) always lie on (\beta) (i.e., move the two points (P, Q) continuously once around along the curve (\beta)), suppose the locus of (M) becomes a simple closed curve (\gamma). Show that the area of the region between the two curves (\beta) and (\gamma) is (\pi/4).

**Solution.**

Given the triangle as above, by Pappus’s median theorem, (a^2 + b^2 = 2(c^2 + d^2)) holds.

Therefore, the following holds.
