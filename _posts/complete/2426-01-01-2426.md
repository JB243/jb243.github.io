## 1. 

For the following matrix $A$, find real numbers $a, b, c$ such that $A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI$. (Here, $I$ is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix.)

<br>

<br>

## **Solution.**

We can find the following relation.

<br>

<img width="500" height="147" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 34 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e005710-3052-4085-9db2-e7dc72113643" />

<br>

∴ $A^5 = A^2 \times (-3A) = (-3)^2 A$, so $a = 0$, $b = 9$, $c = 0$

<br>

<br>

## 2. 

In 3-dimensional coordinate space, let $S$ be the surface given by $4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1$. Show that the surface $S$ contains exactly two lines passing through the point $P(1, 2, 1)$, and if the acute angle between the two lines is $\theta$, find the value of $\cos \theta$.

## **Solution.**

$S$: The visualization result of $4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1$ is as follows.

<br>

<img width="292" height="251" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 36 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b753ec0f-b29a-4e34-b399-8496d30a3e6a" />

<br>

A line passing through $P(1, 2, 1)$ can be written as $(at + 1, bt + 2, ct + 1)$, $t \in \mathbb{R}$, so

$4(ct + 1)^2 = (at + 1)^2 + (bt + 2)^2 - 1 \Leftrightarrow 4c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ (**Equation 1**), $8c = 2a + 4b$ (**Equation 2**)

To normalize $(a, b, c)$, let $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$ (**Equation 3**), and since the direction vector can be taken in both directions, restrict to $c \ge 0$ (**Equation 4**).

From (**Equation 1**) and (**Equation 2**), we obtain $c^2 = 1/5$, and from (**Equation 4**), $c = \sqrt{1/5}$.

From $a^2 + b^2 = 4/5$, we can set $a = \sqrt{4/5}\cos \varphi$, $b = \sqrt{4/5}\sin \varphi$.

We can obtain $2a + 4b = 2\sqrt{4/5}\cos \varphi + 4\sqrt{4/5}\sin \varphi = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{4/5})^2 + (4\sqrt{4/5})^2}\sin(\varphi+\alpha) = 4\sin(\varphi+\alpha) = 8c = 8/\sqrt{5}$.

Since $4 > 8/\sqrt{5}$, $(a, b, c) = (\sqrt{4/5}\cos \varphi, \sqrt{4/5}\sin \varphi, \sqrt{1/5})$ **exists in exactly 2 ways**.

Now, to determine the number of solutions exactly, ignore (**Equation 3**), (**Equation 4**) introduced separately and focus only on (**Equation 1**), (**Equation 2**).

Then we can easily find $(a, b, c) = (0, 2, 1), (8, 6, 5)$. (**Footnote:** If it is not easy to find, you can determine the solutions using $\varphi$ and $\alpha$ found above.)

Therefore, $\cos \theta$ is as follows.

<br>

<br>

<br>

## 3. 

Find the real number $N$ satisfying the following equation.

<br>

<img width="400" height="74" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 40 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9de5996-0a25-4f06-bb47-c843dfc90c14" />

<br>

## **Solution.**

<br>

<img width="550" height="556" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 40 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b825caf0-9613-48d8-832a-8180840bcfc3" />

<br>

<br>

## 4. 

Find the tens digit and the ones digit of $37^{2024}$, respectively.

## **Solution.**

Euler’s totient function of $100$ is as follows.

<br>

<img width="360" height="113" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 41 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0d722d5-fbd8-4ffd-a6f4-287ae72cdb04" />

<br>

Therefore, since $37$ and $100$ are coprime, by Euler’s theorem the following holds.

$37^{\varphi(100)} \equiv 37^{40} \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$

Therefore, the following holds.

$$
37^{2024} \equiv 37^{24} = (30 + 7)^{24}) \equiv 2^{4} \times 30 \times 7^{23} + 7^{24}) \equiv 20 \times (7^{4})^{5} \times 7^{3} + (7^{4})^{6}) \equiv 20 \times 343 + 1) \equiv 61 \pmod{100}
$$

<br>

<br>

## 5. 

Let $f(x)$ be a real function defined on all real numbers, twice differentiable, and $f''(x)$ is continuous. Also, for all $x$, $f'(x) > 0$ and $f''(x) < 0$. Prove that for any positive $t$, the following holds.

<br>

<img width="242" height="63" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 43 53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34521af4-b16d-44b3-bfb3-a144ea7664f5" />

<br>

## **Solution.**

I referred to the official solution.

<br>

<img width="551" height="452" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 44 14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b8815e2-e70d-4f7a-8a99-76b85fbfbae6" />

<br>

<br>

## 6. 

For real numbers $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n$ satisfying the two conditions below, find the following maximum value. (Assume $n \ge 3$.)

<br>

<img width="245" height="227" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 45 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e41eac2-d02f-4933-bd5f-a5999ac62495" />

<br>

## **Non-official Solution.** 

At first, I attempted the following approach using a quadratic form matrix $A$, but due to the condition $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 0$, it was difficult to proceed further.

<br>

<img width="299" height="97" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 46 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0186ae4f-16af-4a16-b589-0d5c3bca87d7" />

<br>

However, from the official solution, it is clear that it is related to [Linear Algebra](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1014).

Since the objective function and constraints are differentiable for all $(a_1, \cdots, a_n)$, the maximum of the objective function is determined at a local maximum.

Let us find a local maximum using the [Lagrange multiplier method under multiple equality constraints]([https://jb243.github.io/pages/1813) (Lagrange multiplier).

<br>

<img width="460" height="516" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 47 04" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0371cc38-589e-4d84-b09c-7d3791c72e14" />

<br>

Now, borrowing an idea from [Group Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2082), let us understand the characteristics of $f(a, b) = \sum_i a_{i+a}a_{i+b}$, which has cyclic properties under the $\sum$ operation.

> ○ $f(0, 0) = 1$

> ○ $f(a, b) = f(b, a)$: Commutative law

> ○ $f(a+c, b+c) = f(a, b)$

> ○ $f(a+c, b) = f(a-c, b)$

> ○ $f(a, b+c) = f(a, b-c)$

> ○ $\sum_c f(a+c, b) = 0$ (**∵** $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2 = 0)$

> ○ $\sum_c f(a, b+c) = 0$ (**∵** $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2 = 0)$

If we mark the values $f(a, b)$ on an $n \times n$ matrix at $(a, b)$, it is $1$ along the right-going diagonal direction, and the values appear symmetrically in a plus-shape about that diagonal.

<br>

<img width="251" height="250" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 49 06" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f9d3c2-1a4c-42df-8bb6-f8ddfccba637" />

<br>

Moreover, since the sum of all function values in any chosen row or column becomes $0$, we may conjecture that $f$ is cyclic.

Therefore, for a cyclic function $g$, we can set $f(a, a \pm c) = g(2\pi c/n)$, with $g(0) = 1$.

According to representation theory, any real 1-dimensional representation of a finite cyclic group (an abelian group) must ultimately be expressible in the form of $\cos$ or $\sin$.

That is, every element of a cyclic group is expressed as a power of a fixed element, and when considering complex functions as well, $e^{i\theta}$ becomes that element.

Therefore, considering $g(0) = 1$, we have $f(a, a \pm c) = \cos(2\pi c/n)$.

Even without using representation theory, we can reach a similar conclusion.

Even if an arbitrary function $f$ is given, it can be approximated by values similar to $f(a, a \pm c) = \cos(2\pi c/n)$.

But to satisfy $f(a, a) = 1$, $f(a, a+1) \simeq \cos(2\pi/n)$, $\cdots$, $f(a, a+(n-1)) \simeq \cos(2(n-1)\pi/n)$, we must determine $(a_1, \cdots, a_n)$.

Since there are $n$ equations and $n$ variables, the solution is uniquely determined, and the previously found $f(a, a \pm c) = \cos(2\pi c/n)$ is exactly that solution.

Therefore, $(\text{quasi-inequality}) \le f(a, a+1) = \cos(2\pi/n)$, and the equality condition is as follows.

<br>

<img width="356" height="62" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 51 23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f6788d6-273e-4bf1-9c05-bcc44db3b9ab" />

<br>

For reference, when $a_1 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, $a_2 = -1/\sqrt{2}$, $a_3 = \cdots = a_n = 0$, the given conditions are satisfied, but it is not the maximum because it does not satisfy the Lagrange multiplier conditions.

## **Official Solution.** 

Let $V = \mathbb{C}^n$, and define the linear map $\phi$: $V \to V$ as follows.

$\phi(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) = (a_2, a_3, \cdots, a_n, a_1)$

For the $n$-th root of unity $\zeta = e^{2\pi i/n} = \cos(2\pi / n) + i\sin(2\pi/n)$ and $1 \le k \le n$,

let $v_k = (\zeta^k, \zeta^{2k}, \cdots, \zeta^{nk})$.

(For example, $v_n = (1, 1, \cdots, 1)$.) Then the following holds.

> ○ $\phi(v_k) = \zeta^k v_k$. That is, $v_k$ is an eigenvector of $\phi$ (with eigenvalue $\zeta^k)$. In particular, the vectors ${v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n}$ form a basis of the complex vector space $V = \mathbb{C}^n$.

> ○ $v_k \cdot v_k^* = (\zeta^k, \zeta^{2k}, \cdots, \zeta^{nk}) \cdot (\zeta^{-k}, \zeta^{-2k}, \cdots, \zeta^{-nk}) = n$ (where $v^*$ is the complex conjugate of $v$)

> ○ $j := k_1 - k_2 \ne 0 \Rightarrow v_{k_1} \cdot v_{k_2}^* = \zeta^j + \zeta^{2j} + \cdots + \zeta^{nj} = 0$ (where $v^*$ is the complex conjugate of $v$)

Consider an arbitrary vector $v$ satisfying the conditions of the problem as follows.

> ⑴ $v = (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$

> ⑵ $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 0$

> ⑶ $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2 = 1$

Suppose the coordinate expression of $v$ with respect to the basis ${v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n}$ is as follows.

<br>

<img width="197" height="68" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 54 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca480cbe-a23a-42a2-9aa0-f1c7c6f40349" />

<br>

By condition ⑵,

<br>

<img width="397" height="69" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 54 47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fec6ffa1-f471-4968-82c5-c1c036d19796" />

<br>

By condition ⑶,

<br>

<img width="398" height="75" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 55 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1431160-9d58-461a-9292-6e3fc7753719" />

<br>

From this we obtain the following.

<br>

<img width="244" height="78" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 55 33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b3edda0-1fec-446b-a00a-7525900b7c76" />

<br>

Now,

<br>

<img width="651" height="218" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 55 57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157fd2fa-2d41-42c0-a6c1-4673ff9627ad" />

<br>

Since this value is real,

<br>

<img width="598" height="330" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 56 17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30255f9d-c45c-4c95-9f79-63a8ca384ce0" />

<br>

Therefore, the maximum of $a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + \cdots + a_{n-1}a_n + a_na_1$ is $\cos(2\pi/n)$, and this value is attained when

$c_2 = c_3 = \cdots = c_{n-2} = 0$,

so $v$ is of the form $v = c_1 v_1 + c_{n-1} v_{n-1}$. In this case,

$v = c_1(\zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^n) + c_{n-1}(\zeta^*, \zeta^{*2}, \cdots, \zeta^{*n}) \in \mathbb{R}^n$

so we can see that $c_{n-1} = c_1^*$. Also, since $n(\left\|c_1\right\|^2 + \left\|c_{n-1}\right\|^2) = 1$,

<br>

<img width="503" height="59" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 57 28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a8d211b-dc06-4c19-b87f-520a3ed712f7" />

<br>

we can see it is of the form

In particular, when $c = 1/\sqrt{2n}$, choosing

<br>

<img width="398" height="61" alt="스크린샷 2026-01-18 오전 11 57 59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d821d084-0432-44b2-a4f8-7398ce98e4ea" />

<br>

yields the maximum value $\cos(2\pi/n)$.

<br>

<br>

## 7. 

For a bounded closed block region $D$ on the 2-dimensional coordinate plane, suppose the boundary $\beta$ of $D$ satisfies the following.

⑴ $\beta$ is a smooth simple closed curve.

⑵ For any point $O$ on $\beta$, the circle of radius $1$ centered at $O$ meets $\beta$ at exactly two points.

⑶ The tangent line drawn at any point $O$ on $\beta$ does not meet $\beta$ at any other point except $O$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of a rod $PQ$ of length $1$. If we rotate the rod one full turn so that the endpoints $P, Q$ always lie on $\beta$ (i.e., move the two points $P, Q$ continuously once around along the curve $\beta)$, suppose the locus of $M$ becomes a simple closed curve $\gamma$. Show that the area of the region between the two curves $\beta$ and $\gamma$ is $\pi/4$.

## **Solution.**

<br>

Given the triangle as above, by Pappus’s median theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = 2(c^2 + d^2)$ holds.

Therefore, the following holds.
