## 1. Celestial bodies

⑴ Alpha Centauri: 4.37 light-years from the Solar System.

<br>

<br>

## 2. Fluid Dynamics

⑴ Langevin dynamics: predicts molecular motion at each time step and can be run in reverse.

<br>

<br>

## 3. Baryon asymmetry problem 

⑴ Sakharov's condition 

> ① baryon number violation 

> ② C abd CP symmetry violation

> ③ departures from thermal equilibrium

<br>

<br>

## 4. Ising model

⑴ The Ising model (1920s) is a foundational physics model for ferromagnetism.

⑵ It consists of a lattice of spins (like tiny magnets) which can be in one of two states : +1 or -1.

⑶ Each spin interacts with its neighbors, tending to align to minimize overall energy.

⑷ Hopfield saw the parallels of Ising model and neurons

> ① neuron : spins

> ② synaptic weight : interaction strength

> ③ "_My knowledge of the spin-glass lore and a little neurobiology led to the first paper in which I used the word neuron. ... is the most cited paper I have ever written._" - John J. Hopfield
