## **1. Economy**

#### **1.1. Microeconomics**

> ○ What is the functional relationship between the number of employees of a company and the company's market value?

> ○ How low is the work efficiency predicted by game theory compared to the work efficiency predicted by calculus?

> ○ Can the Nash equilibrium break due to human mistake be explained within the Nash equilibrium?

> ○ Isn't game theory incomplete because it can't explain evolution?

> ○ What kind of user behavior information can be obtained from an app, and what is the economic value of each type?

> ○ Is there no diseconomy of scale in the Internet business?

> ○ Combination of Game Theory and Information Theory: Can Information be Stored through Nash Equilibrium?

> ○ Does the size of a company have a positive correlation with the highest price of products it sells?

> ○ If the monthly user count of a service is cyclic, does it mean it has captured most of the demand, and if it's increasing, does it mean it hasn't captured all the demand yet?

> ○ How should a company divide its workforce of 𝑛 employees into teams, and how many team members should there be, in order to maximize the company's revenue?

> ○ Unlike private goods, are public goods not governed by [game theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1914)? For instance, even if someone who shares knowledge is betrayed, the knowledge does not disappear. Moreover, if the other person shares additional knowledge in return, the total amount of knowledge the sharer possesses increases, meaning they always benefit in the end.

<br>

#### **1.2. Macroeconomics**

> ○ Is it advantageous for the government to disclose information to the public or hide it?

>> **➜ As can be seen from the central bank's policy game, the best results can be obtained if the government maintains its policy consistently and gains the trust of economic actors. Therefore, the people's right to know must be protected.**

> ○ If a country reduces taxes on companies, will trickle-down effect be delivered to the people? If so, at what level of tax is the trickle-down effect maximized?

> ○ According to Milton Fiedman's quantity theory of money (QTM), the cause of inflation is only a monetary illusion caused by a sharp increase in the amount of money. However, there is a rebuttal that the velocity of money, an important assumption of QTM, has not been established since 1980s. What is right?

> ○ Power Distribution**:** Can we expect the size of the economy of the industry from the income of the highest earners?  

<br>

#### **1.3. Economic history**

> ○ Is population growth constrained by land according to Malthusian theory?

>> **➜ According to the law of increasing returns of scale, population growth promotes technological development, increasing the output of land exponentially, thereby eliminating practical land constraints. Therefore, population growth is not constrained by land.**

> ○ The increase in per capita GDP or an amount of knowledge can be divided into two periods. The early phase of linear growth is known to have been driven by the Renaissance (1455-1517), and the late phase of exponential growth is known to have been driven by the Industrial Revolution (1776-1815). What drives the economy in 20 years?

> ○ What jobs were prestigious 100 years ago? And what jobs are being prestigious for each country?

> ○ Does macroeconomic or economic history belong to unpredictable areas like the principle of uncertainty in quantum mechanics?

> ○ Does the development of technology imply the loss of old technology? Will AI destroy many technologies (_e.g._, art) in the future?

<br>

#### **1.4. Economic philisophy**

> ○ Why are the areas where money is earned limited even if there are so many different human activities? Currently, the fields are found especially in automobiles, IT devices, oil, drugs, food, cosmetics, etc.

>> ➜ **Opportunity cost means the most valuable thing that you have given up for a choice. The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is because the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry. Obviously, all people's activities will have similar economic importance if they develop to a high level, but because of the logic of comparative advantage by opportunity cost, investment or development is focused on only areas that prosper at the moment.** 

> ○ Wouldn't democracy gives each individual a considerable degree of freedom so that society can have more information and technology? On the other hand, could socialism not accumulate information in society due to minority decisions?

> ○ The application of the theory of evolution at the national level is social evolution, but can't evolution be applied to jobs similarly? It is related to the fact that people's activities are quite diverse, but there are limited lucrative areas.

> ○ Should the robot tax be introduced in an era where robots replace a significant portion of the workoforce?

> ○ Is capitalism still superior to socialism in an era where robots replace a significant portion of the labor force?

<br>
<br>

## **2. Society**

#### **2.1. Language**

> ○ What type of power distribution (power-law) appears in language and why does it appear?

>> ➜ **The power distribution appears in the frequency of a specific word, the frequency of a specific spelling, and the frequency of etymologies shared by the words, and I have actually confirmed the power distribution in [an experiment on the etymology cluster](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1686#:~:text=Power%20Law%20Distribution%20of%20Words). In addition, as [a result of checking the connectivity between postings in Tistory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2291), the number of citations also showed a power distribution.
 The reason for the power distribution is that only the used words are used continuously, so it can be regarded as a kind of rich-get-richer and poor-get-poorer phenomenon, and it is a tendency to be observed throughout society, economy, and culture.**

> ○ Do words with similar sounds have similar meanings?

> ○ If it's hard to pronounce, does it mean that you're pronouncing it wrong? In other words, isn't the pronunciation of every word the most efficient way to make that sound?

> ○ [Sapir–Whorf hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) (Whorfianism): A linguistic hypothesis that suggests the way a person understands and behaves in the world is related to the grammatical system of the language they use. In other words, it posits that biases and stereotypes begin to dominate one's thoughts from the moment they are expressed in language.

> ○ Korean is sensitive to particles (e.g., '은', '는', '이', '가', '을', '를'), while English is sensitive to number and tense. Do these affect the speaker's perception?

<br>

#### **2.2. Population**

> ○ Are the development of technology and the decline of birth rate interrelated?

> ○ Are various problems in Korea, such as the low birth rate, due to the fact that technology maturation was too fast than political and social maturation?

> ○ Why is it that the closer people are to the power, the less likely people have many children?

> ○ In light of the declining population trend, is the prospect of the job as an educator promising?

> ○ What are the new markets for the silver industry?

> ○ Is the low birthrate problem an example of the free-rider problem in economics?

<br>

#### **2.3. Gender**

> ○ Why do men have short hair and women have long hair?

>> ➜ **According to Oriental Confucianism, men once had long hair because they cherished the body as it came from their parents. On the other hand, in the West, men's hair was inevitably short due to frequent wars, and it is believed that these Western customs have spread in modern times.**

> ○ Are fewer women successful at a late age? If so, is it because society forces women to be young?

> ○ Is dating or marriage market a competitive market or monopolistic market?

> ○ Was a slim body preferred even in primitive times when food was scarce? Admittedly, it is said that even babies have a relatively constant standard of beauty.

> ○ Is it related to veneral disease that has historically emphasized fidelity and purity? As if the reason for drinking hot water in China was related to cholera.

<br>

#### **2.4. Culture**

> ○ The size of a book is typically larger in height than in width, is this due to custom or innate symbolism (cf. Golden Ratio)? Why is PowerPoint oriented more horizontally than vertically?

<br>

#### **2.5. Psychology**

> ○ Does excessive informatization make the people unhappy? For example, SNS can increase inferiority complex and fake news can make further problems.

> ○ When taking a test (especially an English test), is the score generally high at the beginning (due to luck or high tension) and the score drops temporarily and then goes up again (due to academic progress)?

> ○ Why do people prefer the end of subway seats?

> ○ If someone repeats the same story a few times, does that mean it's recent?

> ○ Does a person tend to use the other person's formal consent as a basis for justifying his or her argument?

> ○ Is a solid relationship a case where each other needs each other?

> ○ Are people real to what is said first, or what is said late?

> ○ If you don't answer the question straight, is it an answer mixed with your expectations?

> ○ Is it the latest or intense experience that people cite as an example?

> ○ Is it difficult to hate others without suffering specific damage? Expanding this, those who criticize a politician who caused a particular issue may have been harmed by that politician in the past.

> ○ Does continuing to speak informally change one's perception to others?

> ○ Why does the East hate physical dirt and the West hate chemical dirt? Is it related to infectious diseases?

> ○ Is there a clustering criterion that distinguishes people's tendencies more efficiently than MBTI?

> ○ Just as the amplitude of a resonance wave seems to diverge infinitely as it approaches its natural frequency, wouldn't attractiveness also surge dramatically as one approaches the ideal appearance?

> ○ Can the reliability and preference of literary materials also be explained in terms of natural frequency, as mentioned above?

<br>

#### **2.6.** Education 

> ○ Top schools are concentrated in Switzerland, following the eastern and western parts of the United States, and the United Kingdom. There are even many cases of studying abroad from Germany and France to Switzerland. Despite maintaining the status of a neutral country, why has Switzerland become a coveted destination for many studying abroad?

> ○ It seems that elementary, middle, and high school education is largely focused on playing with numbers. Is there a good test that evaluates students in a way that is not just playing with numbers?

<br>

#### **2.7. Collective behavioral science**

> ○ Why is Heinrich's law (1:29:300's law) valid? Can we find the clue in brain science?

> ○ Is Mecalf's law an example of power law?

<br>

#### **2.8. Politics**

> ○ Should minorities be given preferential treatment? And can minority preferential policies be supported according to market principles?

> ○ Human beliefs are multidimensional, not one-dimensional. Wouldn't it be possible to know how many types of strong beliefs there are if you know the proportion of high-ranking political participants?

> ○ Does support for leaders decrease in the early stages of moving from extreme politics to cooperation? Then, isn't there less motivation to do politics of compromise?

> ○ How should a leader prioritize issues such as safety, economy, diplomacy, and national defense?

> ○ Can strained state relations be resolved only in a political system in which leaders can change?

> ○ Is it better to take strategic ambiguity rather than clear routes? Is diplomacy different from politics in this problem?

> ○ Are there objective indicators (e.g., degree of support) that can evaluate a leader's performance, such as financial indicators for CEO?

<br>
<br>

## **3. Law**

> ○ Is it reasonable to judge the court's interpretation as unconstitutional while leaving the provisions of the law intact?

> ○ According to Gödel's theorem of imperfection, there is always an error in a formal system. Then, what errors are in the constitutional law?

> ○ Is the law able to handle all situations?

> ○ Is the Property Law similar to natural science and the Bond Law similar to game theory?

> ○ Is ChatGPT's legal advice not legally violated?
