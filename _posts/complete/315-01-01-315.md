## **§ Message §**

I have previously introduced [many unresolved scientific problems](https://jb243.github.io/pages/242). One such problem is the following question:

<br>

### What are the solutions to solve the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?

<br>

To solve the Great Pacific Garbage Patch problem, I explored environmental topics, which led me to solve problems from the [Environmental Chemistry](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1423) of the Korean national exam for highly professional public officers. I encountered various interesting concepts such as oxygen demand, microbial denitrification processes, the relationship between pE and pH, isothermal adsorption equations, and [pool disinfection using electrolysis](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1527).

<br>

At some point, a specific idea materialized regarding this issue. It is to use **spatiotemporal omics technology on the ocean**
([ref](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.31.542821v1.full)). And to find microorganisms that have plastic decomposition activity. However, since applying spatiotemporal omics technology to an immensely vast area like the ocean is needed, I concluded that the current level of technology is insufficient. Therefore, I thought it would be better to share my idea in the form of a sci-fi novel.

<br>

In addition to this, while writing the sci-fi novel, I aim to address the following:

> ● Despite the advent of the era of ChatGPT, why is it still meaningful to create novels? For instance, can ChatGPT invent something?

> ● If a protagonist who has distanced himself from people gets closer to them, what realizations and emotional lines does he go through?

> ● Is the narrative medium more effective in conveying some convincing scientific hypothesis or invention idea?

<br>

On May, 2024, I published this sci-fi novel to share my ideas with readers worldwide.

*A once joined a company where there was someone named "Central Park". Being a cheerful and playful person by nature, A laughed and joked upon hearing the name.*

*“Pfft. How can someone’s name be Central Park? What’s your younger sibling’s name—National Park?”*

*At A’s first company, everyone laughed together. Even the person named Central Park laughed along, saying he often heard that kind of joke. That incident helped A become known as a fun and friendly person, and they got along well with others.*

*Later, when A moved to a new job, there was, coincidentally, another person named Central Park. He wasn’t the same one from the previous company. Recalling the positive experience from before, A made the same joke:*

*“How can someone’s name be Central Park? I guess your sibling’s name is National Park?”*

*But this time, the people at the new company were offended. They asked how someone could laugh at a name given by a person’s parents. A was even called in by a manager. They didn’t fit in well at this company and eventually resigned.*

*Was A at fault in this story? Not necessarily. It’s just that the first company was a good match for A’s personality, while the second one wasn’t. Value judgments exist within the context of a group, and when someone finds themselves in a group that doesn’t suit them, leaving it may be the right decision.*
