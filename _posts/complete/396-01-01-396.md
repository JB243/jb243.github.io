§ The higher the topic, the more basic it is.

<br>

## **Philosophy**

**1.** [What is knowledge?](https://nate9389.tistory.com/387) 

⑴ Isn't Goedel's theorem of imperfections not applicable to a three-stage argument that is too obvious? What does Goedel's incomplete theorem prove?

<br>

**2.** [What is justice?](https://nate9389.tistory.com/2273) 

⑴ Could the reason for the diversification of value judgments be that we’re meant to navigate and balance them according to the situation?

⑵ Being overly fixated on a single value judgment doesn’t seem like a wise strategy for living in this world. It seems like the most important knowledge to learn in your twenties. If you live like water flowing, you will never be able to properly adjust the weighting of value judgments.

⑶ All emotions contribute to decision-making, but certain emotions also shape identity and life paths.

⑷ As we get older, all emotions become less intense. As a result, our sense of judgment also loses its sharpness.

<br>

**3.** Is there a meaning to life?

⑴ It may seem rather sacred because it is meaningless.

> ① Art needs to be more stubbornly artistic.

⑵ Nietzsche referred to emotional as Dionysos and rational as Apollon. He said that the purpose of life may be to seek to become more valuable by building intelligence (Apollon), or to explore a wider fantasy world through free imagination (Dionysos). 

> ① From a slightly different perspective, Dionysian qualities seem to align with intuition-based decisions, while Apollonian qualities resemble conviction-based decisions.

⑶ There aren’t really that many reasons to keep living.

> ① I want to create a world where each day is fun and tomorrow is something to look forward to. Wouldn’t that make us want to live just one more day?

> ② [For a forever fun world](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2424)

<br>

**4.** Nature is precisely determined by calculus, and human behavior is finely determined by [game theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1914).

⑴ Therefore, the rules of nature are continuous, and the rules of society are discrete.

> ① Social rules are discrete because they are governed by game theory.

> ② Discreteness is an emergent property observed at the societal level. For example, the characteristic of discreteness is exemplified by the tendency of people to form groups to gain strength.

> ③ There is a claim that discreteness arises from the non-linear activation function in neural networks.

> ④ It may be because intelligent beings tend to choose only the maximum or minimum solutions.

⑵ It is a virtue to do a lot in the Science of Nature, and it is a virtue to take a balance in the Science of Human.

> ① It is related to Nash Equilibrium in social science.

> ② Human relationships may not be give and take. However, the work is clearly give and take.

⑶ In the science of humans, achieving balance is similar to finding an optimal solution on a manifold.

<br>

**5.** A dynamic world is fundamentally a happy one.

⑴ The Reason a Dynamic World is Happy

> ① Because through change, we can dream of hope. Most people are deeply interested in upward social mobility.

> ② In a static world without any crises, people's spirits tend to grow weaker.

> ③ According to game theory, dynamic individuals have a strategic advantage.

> ④ Because if left alone, it will deteriorate according to the second law of thermodynamics.

> ⑤ Nothing in this world is easy or guaranteed. But that's exactly what makes life interesting — and why we should keep challenging ourselves.

> ⑥ The world with only one correct answer is boring. - Seibu Department Store Advertisement (2009)

⑵ A pluralistic society is dynamic, whereas a monolithic society is static.

> ① A diversified society does not line people up, so people are happier.

> ② Society can be happier if it can present appearances with various charms instead of lookism.

> ③ Religion is fundamentally static and resembles nihilism in that it shows little interest in this world.

> ④ Political ideologies must always evolve.

> ⑤ Doesn't the commonly mentioned "economic uncertainty" actually imply a kind of certainty — that the economy shows no sign of improving?

> ⑥ Authoritarianism is associated with a static society, while democracy is associated with a dynamic society. 

⑶ Since truth exists, the world must be static to some extent.

> ① Because the world is somewhat static, efforts to make it dynamic are meaningful.

⑷ The axiom of incompleteness logically guarantees uncertainty in this world.

> ① It's not that the theory is wrong — it's just that this world is dynamic and noisy.

> ② History enjoys playing tricks. That makes things even more uncertain.

⑸ To fully embrace a dynamic worldview, one must be incredibly strong—strong enough to transcend the bounds of the individual self.

> ① Alpha males and alpha females are not defined through relative comparison. They are objectively characterized by whether they have embraced a dynamic worldview based on strong self-assurance.

>> ○ These are those who have reached [a certain non-obvious intuition](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2431#4-waiting-intuition).

> ② A strong person can even control a dynamic worldview.

> ③ Even if it's just enjoying the uncertainty, it's that I'm controlling the world, not the world controlling me.

> ④ So inventors have this paradoxical ability to have that 10,000 hours of practice and be a real domain expert and have that biginner's mind and look at it freshly even though they know so much about the domain. - Jeff Bezos 

⑹ [For an eternally interesting world](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2424)

> ① I wish this world were uncertain. I hope this world isn't too predictable.

<br>

<br>

## **Self-development**

**6.** The advancement of humanity must be eternal. This is because if humanity ceases to advance, our energy will act in a direction that destroys us.

⑴ Personal Growth

> ① Similarly, a person thirsty for growth should never stop growing. This is because that explosive energy will turn inward.

> ② If a politician stops growing, their political career is over.

> ③ A person changes when they stop growing. Do you not have people around you who have changed? Why did they change fundamentally? Some people grow forever.

> ④ There are some people who, paradoxically, never change because they are constantly growing.

⑵ The Growth of Humanity

> ① Perhaps humanity is cursed with the need to develop endlessly.

> ② However, humanity can grow forever, as the amount of knowledge is [infinite](https://jb243.github.io/pages/387).

<br>

**7.** A person lives to realize his or her self. 

⑴ People realize what they are good at by comparing themselves to others and establishing themselves.

⑵ Picasso is said to have already completed the painting level at the age of five. But isn't it that he's interested in Cubism that the well-drawn masterpieces are too obvious and there's no new area to try?

<br>

**8.** A pessimist is ultimately one who has ceased to grow.

⑴ Why are pessimists bad?

> ① If there are no more facts to criticize, a pessimist criticizes the absence of facts to criticize.

> ② Similarly, pessimists criticize perfect people for lacking humanity.

> ③ Optimists have qualities that attract people, but pessimists fail to get along even with those who are similar.

> ④ Visionaries and critics are quite incompatible.

⑵ It's easy to think negatively. 

> ① Anyone can speak negatively. But focusing only on the negative will never lead to success.

⑶ Once you start thinking negatively, you can continue to think negatively endlessly.

⑷ [I cannot logically refute a pessimist driven by conviction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2273#6-my-concept-of-justice). 

> ① This is because two independent and stable logical systems are not logically superior to each other in terms of their mutual contradictions.

⑸ Once an arrogant pessimist seemed ridiculous, their words no longer reached my ears.

> ① If there’s a large gap in levels of thought, even sound cannot convey meaning.

⑹ Pessimists and narcissists share many similarities — profound insecurity and an inherently inferior nature.

<br>

**9.** On success and failure

⑴ The speed of growth

> ① The development of a person is also an example of punctuated equilibrium. It is called 'motive'. 

<br>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55747737/198045495-d7b26edb-21e3-4e9d-a3a9-1191e7185f61.png" alt="drawing" style="width:400px;"/>

The growth of punctuated equilibrium of multinational enterprises 

<br>

> ② If one overcomes failure, trials, solitude, and heartbreak, they become admirable; if they succumb, they become strange. Darkening is common, while whitening occurs only rarely.

>> ○ To avoid falling into darkness, two conditions are necessary: first, you must know that you are a worthy being; second, there must be a truth you believe in.

> ③ Paradoxically, failure is an essential ingredient for awakening and success.

> ④ Human growth is so great that it can even change causality or go against nature's providence.

> ⑤ Life is the art of possibility. Life is sometimes impulsive rather than strategic.

> ⑥ After failing once and ending up alone, I realized it wasn’t so bad.

>> ○ You have to leave behind a moment of insignificance and take the risk of failure to move forward.

⑵ There exists an objective measure of growth.

> ① It is the accumulation of knowledge, which is unique to humans unlike other animals.

> ② Similarly, the growth of societies or civilizations can also be defined.

> ③ It is not money. However, money can be a good motivator.

> ④ Knowledge fades if left unattended, so not only the amount of accumulated knowledge but also the speed of its generation is important.

>> ○ Knowledge is a human value. ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2273#7-my-concept-of-justice))

>> ○ How long will this dualistic definition—based on the quantity of knowledge and the speed at which it is produced—remain valid?

⑶ Without pain, humans cannot grow.

> ① A man becomes the strongest when he or she is alone. 

> ② Because they get bored easily.

> ③ The glass ceiling is not meant to lock yourself up. It's meant to be broken.

> ④ The world has never felt easy. The experiences strengthened me.

> ⑤ Conceit stops growth.

> ⑥ There are not many opportunities for growth. Thus, one needs to find his or her opportunity.

> ⑦ Solitude and trials strengthen intuition, and that leads to irreversible growth in a person.

> ⑧ Even with objective success and physical strength, one can easily falter without inner resilience.

> ⑨ An amateur runs until they reach their limit; a professional starts running from the moment they feel their limit.

> ⑩ The very reason you chose life at the crossroads of life and death means you are destined to become a king.

>> ○ History sometimes insists on keeping you alive—just so it can make you a king.

⑷ There are no prodigies in life.

> ① Similarly, there are no prodigies in politics either.

> ② In the end, you have to learn by facing challenges and experiencing failures.

> ③ Instead of wasting time on regrets, sharpen your focus and push yourself a little further. Time is precious, and success is always far away.

<br>

**10.** On greed

⑴ The Merits of Desire

> ① Entropically speaking, this world is not a hospitable environment for life. I believe that human greed serves as a driving force for survival and development in such an uncompromising world. Therefore, greed cannot be considered purely bad.

> ② Desire creates motivation.

> ③ Love can change easily, but desire does not. Thus, in order for love to remain unchanged, it must be intertwined with desire.

> ④ When desire is combined with philosophy, it becomes incredibly powerful.

⑵ The Problems of Unrestrained Desire

> ① It hinders rational judgment.

> ② It invites those who seek to exploit uncontrollable desires.

> ③ It diminishes one’s charm.

⑶ The Ultimate Form of Desire Is the Absence of Desire

> ① When you truly want something, you are willing to wait even ten years to obtain it. Through that patience, you learn to temper your desires—and eventually, you attain what you sought.

⑷ The Desire for Knowledge Is Healthier Than Other Desires

> ① Curiosity is the ability to define problems, something AI cannot do.

⑸ Motivation is expressed as the product of dopamine receptor density, dopamine sensitivity, and the difference between the goal state and the current state.

<br>

<img width="222" alt="스크린샷 2025-06-01 오후 4 19 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de6a7b3e-c9e1-43df-9c77-39cb571ff4fc" />

<br>

> ① y: Level of motivation

> ② k₁: Density of the dopamine reward circuit

> ③ k₂: Sensitivity of the dopamine reward circuit

> ④ x<sub>goal</sub>: Desired state of oneself

> ⑤ x<sub>present</sub>: Current state of oneself

> ⑥ α: Exponential constant

> ⑦ These constants can vary due to environmental (acquired) factors.

<br>

**11.** One should have a philosophy to build huge wealth. The reasons are as follows.

⑴ Because a greater value is needed, as it is not beneficial to society that social resources are concentrated on certain individuals.

> ① A greater value and kindness are alike—in that even with a few mistakes, they can still be forgiven.

⑵ Because justification is needed for those who may feel deprived and jealous when social resources are concentrated on specific individuals.

⑶ Because it needs a value that surpasses the violation of the anti-trust regulation act. 

<br>

**12.** If you are in your country, you are evaluated as a job, and if you go abroad, you are evaluated as an achievement.

<br>

**13.** The most obvious strategy for success is: the more, the better.

⑴ Because the utility by work is exponential. For example, it is possible to work three times more and earn ten times more.

⑵ Because, if we grow quantitatively, we grow qualitatively as well.

⑶ However, when speed and direction are matched, the probability of success increases.

⑷ When it comes to applying, the more, the better. We can't control whether we get accepted, but we can control how many applications we submit.

⑸ The more frequently you monitor your emotions, the better decisions you can make.

⑹ **Theory 1.** [Endogenous Growth Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2020)

⑺ **Theory 2.** [The law of increasing returns](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1654)

⑻ **Theory 3.** In statistics, the variance of the sum of n independent random variables is simply n times the variance of one, whereas the variance of a single random variable multiplied by n is n² times larger.

<br>

<img width="202" alt="스크린샷 2025-04-26 오후 3 50 32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e288c300-b993-483e-b6c5-cfb5481318fe" />

<br>

**14.** The ant's law that 70% of the population don't work does not apply to humans. Because humans are special.

<br>

**15.** It's a waste of time even to blame someone.

<br>

**16.** If you have walked your path endlessly with sharp determination, you will become a truly unique being.  

⑴ The fake envies the real.  

⑵ Fake madness cannot surpass true madness.

⑶ I don't need others to agree with who I am. - Itaewon Class

<br>

**17.** If a genius has brilliance, a dullard has earnestness.

<br>

**18.** When you want to do something, you find a way. When you don't, you find an excuse. 

<br>

**19.** The word "overwhelming gap" always warms my heart.

<br>

**20.** Being swayed back and forth and changing one's convictions is a sign of a weak person.

⑴ Similarly, being placed in a dilemma is also evidence of weakness.

⑵ To avoid falling into dilemmas, one must exercise the uniquely human ability of creativity. The absence of creativity places us in dilemmas.

<br>

**21.** On Humility  

⑴ Success is more influenced by luck than we often realize. Your success may not last forever.  

⑵ If you have a lot to protect, you must be humble. Having enemies can reduce your gains.  

⑶ If you have a lot to learn, you must be humble. Arrogance hinders the acquisition of new knowledge.

<br>

**22.** No one lives in the same world.

⑴ If there are a hundred people, there are a hundred colors and a hundred stories.

⑵ People with dark irises have difficulty seeing in low light compared to those without, but they are more resistant to glare.

⑶ The world is not fair. Some people are born with an abundance of blessings, while others face continuous challenges every moment.

⑷ However, this world is well-designed and offers rewards for overcoming trials.

> ① Those who experience many trials can give hope to others and gain momentum through their growth as they overcome.

> ② Just as there is as much sky as there is land, there is as much joy as there is sorrow.

<br>

**23.** [On intuition](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2431) 

⑴ Intuition is implicit knowledge.

⑵ There are three types of intuition in this world.

⑶ **Type 1:** Intuition for Reading

> ① In the manga One Piece, this corresponds to Observation Haki. This type of intuition is related to the humanities.

> ② Instinct and intuition must also be trained.

> ③ Intuitive judgment is always faster than rational judgment—and time is always limited.

> ④ Understanding oneself is also important.

⑷ **Type 2:** Intuition for Acting (Writing)

> ① In One Piece, this corresponds to Armament Haki. This type of intuition is related to the social sciences.

> ② Choices are far more important than talent.

> ③ Making decisions is inherently difficult.

> ④ Decisions are closely tied to conviction, challenge, courage, and attraction.

⑸ **Type 3:** Intuition for Waiting

> ① In One Piece, this corresponds to Conqueror's Haki. This type of intuition is related to the historical sciences.

> ② It is the ability to stay patient while communicating with history.

> ③ When this intuition awakens, one finally becomes worthy of being called a king.

> ④ Only when the intuition to read history precedes can one begin to change destiny.

<br>

**24.** On passion

_You guys will find that you have passions. And having a passion is a gift. I think we all have passions. And you don't get to choose them. They pick you. But you have to be alert to them. You have to be looking for them. And when you find your passion, it's fantastic gift for you. Because if it gives you direction, gives you purpose. You can have a job, you can have a career, or You can have a calling. And the best thing is to have a calling. If you find the passion, you hit the jackpot. If you have that, all your work feels like work to you._

- Jeff Bezos

<br>

**25.** Respect to all who dare to challenge, and blessings to those who overcome.

<br>

**26.** On exercise

⑴ Health improves, and since the results are visibly noticeable (e.g., your body actually gets fitter), overall life satisfaction increases.  

⑵ Paradoxically, even though it takes time, your stamina improves so much that you end up having more time and using it more efficiently.  

⑶ Endorphin and dopamine release help refresh your mood.  

⑷ Since your mind temporarily clears, it becomes easier to switch contexts.  

⑸ Your personality improves. Many conflicts happen simply because people are physically exhausted.  

⑹ You become more curious, as curiosity is a cognitive function that demands a lot of energy.

⑺ You can exercise alone.

<br>

**27.** The Benefits of Keeping a Light Mind

⑴ It's easier to accept new ideas.

⑵ Context switching becomes faster (accelerated thinking).

⑶ The power of intuition grows stronger.

⑷ Since most memories fade anyway, keeping a light mind helps retain only what’s truly important.

⑸ A heavy mind consumes more energy and makes the body feel heavier too.

⑹ Similarly, it's important to keep relationships light.

<br>

**28.** How to Win Against the Masses in the Abyss

⑴ Fine-tuning strategy: You must adjust your conversation topics, personality, and negotiation tactics for each person you meet.

> ① It is also referred to as "fine-tuning" or "alternating strength and softness."

⑵ The kinder you are, the easier it is to be forgiven for inevitable mistakes.

⑶ False madness bows before true madness.

<br>

<br>

## **Relationship**

**29.** [On Kindness and Anger](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2433)

⑴ It’s better to be wicked than weak  

⑵ Kindness is difficult.

⑶ I am interested in people who care about me and respect me.  

⑷ Anger is a signal for escaping danger.

⑸ Anger as a driving force for success  

⑹ Anger, more than any other emotion, must be used very carefully.

<br>

**30.** On Happiness 

⑴ If you look forward to tomorrow when you close your eyes, isn't that happiness?

⑵ A life with news is proof that you are well off.

⑶ Happiness is having an unexpected encounter in an unexpected place.

⑷ In the end, a happy person is someone who knows how to be happy.

⑸ If a person can enjoy even failure, heartbreak, and uncertainty, they are already living a blessed life — because there is no longer any reason to be unhappy.

> ① Curiosity and a sense of adventure may be emotions that naturally developed to survive in an uncertain world.

⑹ Happiness that depends on many variables is difficult to last long.

> ① A happiness that depends on money as a premise is not sustainable.

> ② Since human relationships are constantly changing, seeking happiness in them is bound to lead to trouble.

> ③ Sometimes, there are relationships that don’t change, and in those moments, you can just find it amusing and interesting.

> ④ Since the proposition 'everything changes' is itself subject to change, it cannot be regarded as an absolute truth.

⑺ Happiness should be sought within oneself, not from others.

> ① Without sufficient training of intuition, you may mistake happiness defined by others for your own happiness.  

> ② This is related to the mechanism of manipulation.

> ③ Being overproud is being overscarce.

<br>

**31.** When you go out into society, it is meaningless whether a particular person is good or bad. It only matters whether the person is profitable or not.

<br>

**32.** Humans aren’t naturally suited to living alone, but with awareness, they can learn to do so.

⑴ Being born as an animal and becoming a higher intellectual being also mean that people are unstable.

⑵ What I fear most isn’t being alone, but my life becoming boring.

<br>

**33.** A dream dreamt alone is just a dream, but a dream dreamt together is reality.

<br>

**34.** Human nature tends to neglect its own possessions and covet those of others.

⑴ Therefore, someone who loves no one can potentially be loved by everyone.

<br>

**35.** On apology

⑴ An apology is a declaration that you will not threaten, deceive, or seek to dominate the other person.

⑵ Since there is no infallible being, apologies are inevitable.

⑶ The discussion about whether one should apologize is similar to the discussion about whether one should be kind.

<br>

**36.** Do truly successful people share the secrets to their success because they know it's hard to follow anyway—and to avoid wasting energy worrying about what others think?

<br>

**37.** The clown sheds tears behind the mask.

<br>

**38.** On relationship

⑴ Like the wings of Icarus, relationships between people are not good if they are too close.

⑵ On love

> ① Love is an experience in which others become part of themselves.

> ② Love must be eternal and superior.

>> ○ Just as electromagnetic wave becomes complete as electric and magnetic fields complement each other, love will be such.

>> ○ Eternal love certainly exists. However, I don't take it for granted. All I can do is enjoy even that uncertainty.

> ③ If you really like someone, you should also have the courage to let go.

>> ○ If there’s someone you want to keep by your side, set her free. If she stays close to you even in freedom, she is already yours.

> ④ Paradoxically, those who love themselves receive more love from others.

>> ○ If you know your own worth, you can easily walk away from relationships and groups that don’t respect you.

⑶ On a fatal relationship

> ① Only when you are alone, you can see a fateful relationship.

> ② The person next to you is the fateful relationship, not the person whom you find as the fateful relationship separately.

> ③ Relationships that rely on conditions are difficult to sustain. Let’s focus on the present state, not the future state.

> ④ For a relationship to last long, it needs trials and errors.

> ⑤ There are people who are glad that someone like you exists, but there are also many who feel the opposite. Some of those might even be among your former friends.

> ⑥ Someone who stays by your side even when you’ve become insignificant and humble is truly precious.

> ⑦ Let's avoid people with a low PBI (Personality Brightness Index).

⑷ On trust

> ① Trust is a priceless resource. Once lost, you can never get it back.

> ② Trust amplifies the effectiveness of policies. ([Policy Game Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2043))

> ③ Betrayal offers only short-term gains, whereas building trust is advantageous in the long term.

⑸ There is only contradiction in humans anyway. The important thing is when you notice the other person's contradiction.

> ① The reason why contradictions occur in people is that they take two or more values as a premise.

> ② As the distance between people gets closer, people's contradictions begin to appear.
 
> ③ Everyone has their own faults.

> ④ Therefore, you should focus on yourself rather than on others.

⑹ On obsession

> ① Deficiency is necessary for forming human relationships. However, because deficiency can lead to obsession, it should be handled carefully.

> ② There is no need to be obsessed with human relationships. Being alone is natural, and if someone chooses to be with you, simply appreciate it and be grateful, as if receiving a gift.  

>> ○ So, you need to practice being alone.

>> ○ If you meet just anyone out of loneliness, it can lead to pain. You won’t be able to push away scammers, strange people, or those who try to take advantage of you.

> ③ Falling in love passionately means projecting your own desires onto the other person. ([ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMzc64brqxM&t=2232s)) Since this creates a gap between reality and truth, it is better to avoid it.

> ④ Human relationships are like gravity: once you get too close, it’s hard to break away, and you end up orbiting around each other.

> ⑤ Individuals are unpredictable and not suitable objects of obsession, but could the market be? 

>> ○ Example: Jeff Bezos' customer-centrism

⑺ On separation

> ① Once you decide to break up, hundreds of reasons to leave come to mind.

> ② The fact that there are many reasons not to maintain human relationships means that it is difficult to sustain them.

> ③ While a relationship is being maintained, the problem is not easily noticeable. It seems that when human relationships are formed, the criteria for value judgments are fine-tuned.

> ④ Humans have an instinct to blur their vision in order to form interpersonal relationships.

> ⑤ The relationship between a startup and its early employees is similar to a long-term romance or a first love. Because of the "reasons why it's hard to break up" and the "reasons why you should break up."

⑻ On Liking Oneself

> ① If you don’t believe you’re worthy, no one else will think you are either.

> ② When you like yourself, you create gravity. And where there is gravity, people gather.

> ③ By the time you turn sixty, you realize no one was really paying attention to you anyway.

> ④ If I like myself too much, there aren't that many reasons to like others. That’s why those who are too successful become emotionally detached.

⑼ Just as irregular frequency strengthens memory retention, it can also intensify human relationships.

⑽ It’s often more reasonable to view marriage as a merger of assets—which is why it has much in common with an M&A.

<br>

**39.** On Turmoil

⑴ On Turmoil

> ① It consumes more energy than other emotions and easily leads to extreme conclusions. Therefore, it should be used with caution.

> ② Turmoil is also necessary. For example, it facilitates action readiness, increases work efficiency, and makes difficult challenges possible.

> ③ Constantly being turmoil can lead to further mental exhaustion.

> ④ As you age, turmoil may become diluted.

> ⑤ Humans are wired to hate others easily, which in turn drives them to maximize selfish gain and form groups.

⑵ On inferiority

> ① Revealing your inferiority complex or jealousy to others offers no real advantage.

> ② When feelings of inferiority deepen, a person becomes increasingly preoccupied with others. They may either grow helpless or turn into a narcissist who seeks to dominate those weaker than themselves.

⑶ On Narcissist

> ① Narcissists fear those with a strong inner self. It's extremely difficult for them to assert control among such individuals, and it easily exposes the narcissist's own incompetence and worthlessness. Also, those individuals often don't even spare a glance at the narcissist.

> ② A narcissist who seeks to control others uses fear, a sense of responsibility, and guilt. ([ref](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LDsStdjhUGI))

> ③ Interestingly, it’s often the lowly ones who harbor inferiority complexes that tend to look down on you first.

> ④ There are those who, without knowing their place and without fear, dare to belittle others.

> ⑤ If there is trust, the impact of betrayal is significant. Therefore, you can exploit narcissists' arrogant confidence to gain considerable advantage.

> ⑥ A group can also gaslight an individual.

⑷ Being scratched

> ① Feeling "scratched" or hurt often indicates that the person's self-esteem isn't as strong as they might believe.

> ② Getting angry about being disrespected is pointless—just as we don’t get angry at the chirping of insects.

> ③ Still, if you did get angry, doesn’t that suggest you were secretly feeling inferior yourself?

> ④ If you keep feeling angry or thinking about something, it means your thoughts and emotions have not yet been fully processed. 

⑸ [On anger](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2433#2-on-anger) 

> ① Anger is a danger escape signal.

>> ○ Anger is useful when correcting misaligned hierarchical relationships.

>> ○ Being told not to get angry doesn’t mean not to feel wronged, but to express anger in a refined way.

>> ○ Dissatisfaction and anger are the most powerful intuitions signaling that things are going wrong.

>> ○ A quote from Jeff Bezos

>>> ○ Stress primarily comes from not taking action.

> ② Anger is a driving force for success.

>> ○ It’s not that I’m better than others. I was just angrier than most.

>> ○ Bang Si-hyuk, CEO of BigHit’s Commencement Address at Seoul National University

>> ○ Still, I want to be remembered as someone fun rather than someone angry.

> ③ Turmoil (e.g., Anger), more than any other emotion, must be used very carefully.

>> ○ Getting angry often leads to regret. It’s important to express anger in a refined way, and that takes practice.

>> ○ Composed emotions, gentleness, and principles create authority.

>> ○ If you’ve gained everything you wanted, there’s no reason to stay angry. Anger from insecurity seems unnecessary.

>> ○ If misused, anger can ruin things.

>> ○ Anger consumes a lot of energy, making it difficult to sustain for a long time. This is why constantly being angry can lead to further mental exhaustion.

⑹ Hatred is similar to fear.

⑺ Arrogance is connected to firmness.

⑻ Anxiety about the future has the nature of an investment; it drives careful planning and is meaningful in its own way.

<br>

**40.** People definitely change.

⑴ Is saying that people don’t change just a way to justify giving up on them easily?  

⑵ Or is it because some people change easily while others are more resistant to change?  

⑶ If you build many human relationships, the sum of these relationships is generally more predictable and less variable. 

> ① Although there are many implications, it may basically be better to focus on multiple people rather than concentrating on just one person. 

> ② This is why the logic of the humanities differs from that of the social sciences.

<br>

<br>

## **Theory of Monarchs**

**41.** Kings still exist. This is advice for those who walk the path of the king and a great epic for the king.

⑴ Irregulars exist in this world, distorting the space and time around them. May you understand the weight of your crowns.

<br>

**42.** The paradox of a dictator

⑴ Since the benefits of political power are concentrated only on a few, the dictator basically causes the majority's discontent.

⑵ The reason why a dictator takes the path of a war monarch is to resolve people's dissatisfaction through economic growth.

⑶ However, there is a way to become a technological powerhouse in addition to becoming a war monarch.

<br>

**43.** There are royal roads and apostles on the way to success.

⑴ An example of apostles is that they have secured many minor but loyal customers.

⑵ But how did Elon Musk become king by walking the apostle?

<br>

**44.** The king must be lonely.

⑴ First, it is because it is always lonely to pioneer a new paradigm and a new market.

⑵ Second, it is because only those who walk lonely paths can win public support.

⑶ Third, the king is not a job, but a sudden fate.

> ① The moment you realize that the rules of the world you discovered were right, you will experience an irreversible awakening and grow rapidly.

⑷ Fourth, this world does not welcome the emergence of a king, for he seeks to bring about great change.

> ① The king, by nature, has many enemies. And those enemies are generally powerful — or if not powerful, then dangerous.

⑸ So if you're lonely, you're also walking the path of a king.

⑹ If a special person doesn't want to be lonely, he or she has to make the world a better place and find someone who can admit the value you follow.

> ① Eventually, only the unfortunate genius who knows the secrets of the world changes the world.

> ② Few people can confidently describe themselves as great people. But wouldn't you be able to confidently say you're a special person?

> ③ An altruist is at a disadvantage over an egoist, but in the end, he is empowered by people around him believing in his true feelings.

> ④ People empower those who believe they can.

⑺ So I decided to walk their path with the hope that the giants who move this world would not feel lonely. And I decided to go in search of the king.

<br>

**45.** The king is special.

⑴ The king is neither a lawyer nor a doctor. The king is a king.

⑵ The king must meet the queen.

⑶ There are not many kings. Perhaps there cannot be more than one king in a kingdom as there cannot be two suns in a sky.

⑷ And kings are those who walk on paths that no one has ever walked on and go on paths that no one has ever reached.

⑸ To become a king, one must reach [a certain non-obvious intuition](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2431#4-waiting-intuition).

⑹ A king does not waver, for he does not seek approval — and so his convictions remain unchanged.

<br>

**46.** There are three kinds of kings in the world.

⑴ A king who rules the people with authority and power. 

⑵ A king with a free soul.

⑶ A king who doesn’t even know he is a king. I'm looking for the third type of king.

<br>

Three types of kings appeared in the webtoon 'The Tower of God' 

<br>

<br>

**47.** Change always comes from the outside.

⑴ [Studying abroad is a great journey in search of hope.](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2194)

<br>

**48.** It's not a here if one didn't have a crisis.

⑴ Life is dramatic after all. The person who dramatically overcame the crisis wins in the end rather than the person whose everything is perfect.

⑵ Crisis always comes with opportunity.

> ① It is the same when experiencing the pain of a breakup and the sting of betrayal.

⑶ Every opportunity is sometimes dangerous. Like any fire, if used improperly, it can cause burns.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/e59275c0-9143-4fd7-a636-19c4655b430e)

<br>

**49.** Hero never die. If he or she was dead, it's not a hero already.

⑴ One is not special because they overcome hardships and adversity; they are special because they have overcome hardships and adversity.

⑵ To stay alive, you must never stop growing. Paradoxically, those who grow endlessly are the ones who never truly change.

<br>

**50.** Leaders with poor background build leadership based on strong will. And it's superior.

<br>

**51.** The world is well-made. In the end, those who walk on an unnamed path dominate the world.

⑴ One Piece Animation: The world is well-made. Like Roger wasn't a man of ability.

<br>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55747737/198046753-d3bd4819-cd3c-42bf-8868-df5df5238c52.png" alt="drawing" style="width:400px;"/>

One Piece Vol. 1047

<br>

**52.** A lot starts to be seen when authority is laid down.

<br>

**53.** Rather than forcing beliefs, it is desirable to spread them according to market principles.

<br>

**54.** God is one, and there are only several representatives of God.

<br>

**55.** Those who have gained tremendous wealth from self-made work have succeeded with two partial successes.

⑴ This was especially the case with Softbank Chairman Masayoshi Son, Kakao Chairman Kim Bum-soo, Elon Musk, and Steve Jobs.

⑵ In terms of time, they achieved success in their 20s and 30s and success in their 40s and 50s.

⑶ In particular, Chairman Masayoshi Son set a very specific goal when he was young, and he realized it all.

<br>

**56.** The king must speak the king's language.

<br>

**57.** The truth of this world conveyed by those who have reached the peak of the world can serve as an opportunity to resolve conflicts between classes.

<br>

**58.** There are many obstacles in the way of the king.

<br>

**59.** Fish in an aquarium are happy when they do not know the vastness of the ocean.

<br>

The Tower of God 

<br>

**60.** There is no one who dislikes a strong king.

<br>

**61.** Sometimes there are those who long for the battlefield.

⑴ [Kaido from One Piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Y1x7j7SvE&t=203s): Only war determines human worth.

⑵ David from The Walking Dead New Frontier: A soldier isn't a husband... Or a father. A soldier is a soldier... Nothing else.

⑶ The reason is that, in a mature society, individuals who had previously not been paid much attention—such as sensitive people (for example, women)—gain strength, while tough individuals lose their sense of self-worth. Therefore, a society that has stopped growing and is merely mature harbors inherent risks.

<br>

<br>

## **Social science**

**62.** It is difficult to define even a single individual easily.

⑴ Are fingernails, composed of dead cells that have undergone complete keratinization, considered part of our body?

⑵ I can be an individual self, but I can also be a collective self or a societal self.

> ① In this world, there are some people who live a life as a public good, not a life of a private person. Those who choose to believe in their philosophys should be rewarded.

⑶ From the perspective of the societal self, there is nothing on the news that is not related to me.

⑷ Some people consider not only individuals but also the collective intelligence of humanity as their friend.

<br>

**63.** There are three reasons why people need society.

⑴ First, a newborn child cannot live without parents.

⑵ Second, people have instincts like social animals.

⑶ Third, people belonging to a group are stronger than people who do not belong to a group.

<br>

**64.** Identifying wrongdoing reduces contradictions within a group, but we should be cautious as it can undermine the stability of the group.

⑴ It is wrong to be absolutely zero tolerance for wrongdoing because people can make mistakes.

⑵ There are more adults who make wrongdoings than you think. Because adults no longer believe in the values they believed in when they were young.

⑶ However, it is unjust to make contradictions to reduce contradictions. Therefore, excessive reform is also wrong.

⑷ The more principled a manager is, the healthier the organization is. This is because contradictions of the group are reduced and there is no harm to the stability of the group.

<br>

**65.** Learning is divided into science and art. A study of humanities is involved in art. 

<br>

**66.** Social science is the science of responsibility because it is related to consensus and policy, and natural science is the science of humility because it is related to objectivity.

<br>

**67.** I am politically neutral. However, voting is mandatory for me.

⑴ **Reason 1.** It is inefficient if the scientific and industrial sectors that require large investments are unnecessarily dominated by political pressure.

> ① However, this reason does not seem to apply much to Elon Musk. Earlier this year, he saw President Biden intentionally passing Tesla Motors in the electric vehicle market and tweeted in anger to drive out Joe Biden, which does not seem to shake Elon Musk's position.

> ② The reason why the U.S. raised Elon Musk and still does not restrict him is that Elon Musk can realize the infinite glory of the U.S. What you learn from history is that there is always a phase of decline when you have your heyday. However, if the U.S. monopolizes several planets alone, the U.S. potential will exceed that of all other countries. The reason why it is expressed as 'potential' here is that the United States will not unnecessarily stimulate competitors. 

⑵ **Reason 2.** Real politics, after all, is self-contradictory.

⑶ **Reason 3.** Only those who form a new force can eventually pioneer a new paradigm and a new market.

⑷ **Reason 4.** Because it is not desirable for the fruits of science and technology or new paradigms to pass on political beliefs to the same people.

⑸ For this, I should aim for the future rather than the present for political neutrality.

> ① However, some dreamers and thinkers go to extremes because they are far from reality. 

⑹ For this, I should aim for integration rather than division.

<br>

**68.** The roles of politicians are largely classified in two ways.

⑴ Decrease of social conflict costs

⑵ Guarantee of one's right to life

⑶ In general, it is the domain of politicians to prevent short-term economic fluctuations. And it is the realm of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs that drive long-term economic growth.

<br>

**69.** I think politics and history are examples of punctuated equilibrium. Therefore, an attitude to explain history by dividing it into a specific period rather than a continuous flow is reasonable.

<br>

**70.** The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is that the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry.

⑴ Opportunity cost means the most valuable thing that you have given up for a choice. The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is that the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry. Obviously, all people's activities will have similar economic importance if they develop to a high level, but because of the logic of comparative advantage by opportunity cost, investment or development is focused on only areas that prosper at the moment.

<br>

**71.** The hierarchy of jobs causes social discontent. That is the driving force behind enterpreneurs with unnamed jobs.

<br>

**72.** A nation is a unit that maximizes economies of scale by sharing languages, history, culture, and industry. At the same time, it is a huge group that creates a sense of belonging, identity, and an evironment where people can live like humans.

<br>

**73.** There may be a moment when you have to seriously think about a company without employees, a school without students, and a country without population.

<br>

**74.** A healthy industry should be in a form where both skilled and unskilled workers can participate.

⑴ That is the case with the automobile industry.

⑵ The IT industry consists of 100% skilled workers, which is believed to have an inherent problem.

<br>

**75.** Computer engineering majors learn technology, while economics majors learn the world.

<br>

**76.** As society matures, professional occupations gain more power. South Korea has become quite a mature society. However, maturity is not necessarily a good thing.

⑴ However, society must continue to grow rather than mature.

<br>

**77.** Biology is closer to social science than to physics or chemistry. The reason for this is diversity, heterogeneity, and interaction.

<br>

**78.** The role of future programmers can be diagnosed as follows:

⑴ **Role 1:** Development of LLM models - Not realistic

> ① Developing LLM models requires a considerable scale of servers, making it difficult unless the scale is as large as OpenAI, Meta, or Google.

> ② Even companies like Naver and Kakao have not achieved that scale.

> ③ Some predict that ChatGPT 4.0 might be the final version of an LLM unless companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google combine their efforts.

⑵ **Role 2:** Fine-tuning

> ① The model is already established, and a significant amount of specific training data is provided to improve the model for a specific field.

> ② Example: [ChatGPT fine-tuning](https://wikidocs.net/200282)

⑶ **Role 3:** Crawling from databases and tagging with LLM

⑷ **Role 4:** [Prompt engineering](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2317)

⑸ **Role 5:** Integrating pre-existing models with various front-end and back-end systems for different services.

<br>

**79.** There are three major problems in Korea.

⑴ Low birth rate of 0.82 per couple

> ① There are four main causes of low birth in Korea.

>> ○ Population overcrowding due to the concentration of population in the capital area.

>> ○ Increase of education cost.

>> ○ A lack of impetus in economic growth.

>> ○ A career break for women.

> ② There are five main solutions of low birth in Korea.

>> ○ Local investment.

>> ○ Development the ultimate and best knowledge system. 

>> ○ Promotion of new industries.

>> ○ Transition of childcare teachers to public officials and national guarantee of infant education facilities attached to the workplace.

>> ○ Active support for infertility policy and _in vitro_ fertilization

⑵ The fact of the only divided country in the world

⑶ The highest plastic usage

<br>

**80.** Innovation is a game making losers.

<br>

<br>

## **History science**

**81.** The Korean people are those who have never invaded. So it is a special and chosen people, especially in the globalized world.

<br>

**82.** History science has a different rule than game theory that explains social science.

<br>

**83.** To build a predictable history, leaders must be honest and sincere.

<br>

**84.** If you know history, you don't feel rushed by time. The same goes for human relationships.

⑴ A gentleman’s revenge is never too late, even after ten years.

<br>

<br>

## **Futurology**

**85.** Science has constantly increased the quality of life.

⑴ It is hard to agree that science should be avoided just because it constantly create problems.

⑵ It's because bigger problems arise without science and technology than new problems arise with science and technology. For example, problems arise when society is stagnant, just as water rots when it is stagnant.

<br>

**86.** Humanity is progressing irreversibly.

⑴ Progress is good because it makes humanity worthwhile.

⑵ Water rots when it is stagnant. Therefore, human progress must last forever.

⑶ For example, space technology can develop as much as the size of the universe.

⑷ It is certainly advance of humanity that jobs are becoming diverse and complicated.

<br>

**87.** Science and technology transcend good and evil.

<br>

**88.** The difference between science and technology is that

⑴ Even if the material is the same,

⑵ Technology makes hiding a virtue and science makes disclosure a virtue.

⑶ Technology aims to foster new industries and complete existing industries (e.g. 99% → 99.9%),

⑷ Science aims to complete the Tower of Babel of Human Knowledge, answer countless questions, and think about what mankind should go on.

⑸ While technology aims to solve a given problem, science aims to define a new problem.

⑹ However, perhaps the distinction between science and technology is more of a social consensus than a strict one.

<br>

**89.** There are three reasons why K-content is currently popular in OTT (e.g., Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney Plus, Amazon Studios, etc.).

⑴ Because the Korean people have a 'good' image as non-invasion people.

⑵ Because Korea has freedom of thought; the impetus seems to come from the overwhelming distribution of IT devices.

⑶ Because Korea has experienced a rapid economic rise, giving a sense of homogeneity to developed countries and a sense of reverence to underdeveloped countries.

<br>

**90.** The next-generation innovative science field is diagnosed with five as follow. These fields share the commonality of being high-context disciplines with a significant amount of information.

⑴ Bio

⑵ Environment

⑶ Space

⑷ Quantum mechanics: quantum computers, fusion power, particle physics

⑸ IT: However, it's becoming difficult to view IT as an innovation industry because now there is no field that IT isn't involved in.

<br>

**91.** Giant industries are linked to human desires.

⑴ The field of IT is linked to entertainment.

⑵ The field of law is linked to frequent disputes between people.

⑶ The field of medicine is linked to the desire to live a healthy and long life.

⑷ The field of beauty is linked to the desire to be superior to others.

⑸ The field of space is linked to pure curiosity. So I think it's a special industry.

<br>

**92.** Industry is work places.

⑴ Can an IT industry that destroys other jobs and threatens the jobs of related workers be called an industry?

<br>

**93.** Biological trends are largely divided into two flows. That is the area of bioinformatics combine with data science and art such as chemical biology.

<br>

**94.** In the past, it is said that birds listen to day words and rats listen to night words. But the strange thing is, these days there are no birds or mice.

<br>

**95.** The more mechanized and automated civilization is, the more important the realm of art becomes.

<br>

**96.** Artificial intelligence does not have the innocence of a child.

<br>

**97.** There are four reasons why eco-friendly energy is important.

⑴ Now, the Russian-Ukraine war has threatened that Russia will not supply the world with energy. In the end, it is necessary to realize energy independence from the standpoint of energy security.

⑵ There has been some consensus that the global environment is destroyed by people. Eco-friendly marketing certainly works, and no one can easily refute it even if they set up trade barriers with emphasis on the environment.

⑶ The unit price of eco-friendly energy production continues to fall. In 100 years, all energy will be used as eco-friendly energy, so shouldn't we consider switching to eco-friendly energy from now on?

⑷ Green energy emphasizes scientific capabilities compared to other types of energy. Therefore, there is a high possibility that new industries will grow or start-ups and star entrepreneurs will emerge. There's already Solar City, as well, and it shows us that the focus on private enterprises rather than governments promotes job creation and huge economic growth. It also means that there are many things to study scientifically, so it can create other value-added industries.

<br>

**98.** Environmental problems should be solved by economic logic, not ethics.

⑴ Why has the environmental sector not been industrialized among the innovation fields? Why is a politician in that position instead of a businessperson?

<br>

**99.** Ten years from now, SpaceX's Starship reaches Mars. ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fxaAENrZYw)) What do we have to prepare for that?

⑴ **Topic 1.** Microbiome

> ① There's no better way to make Mars a viable planet than microbes.

> ② In fact, it was a microbe called cyanobacteria that generated oxygen on Earth when there was no oxygen in the air.

⑵ **Topic 2.** Agriculture 

> ① It is important to exploit resources on Mars, and it seems more realistic to transport organic materials than heavy metals by spaceships.

> ② Organic materials can be used as food, but it can also be used as an energy source.

> ③ Energy source is important because they can be sold on Earth or used for spaceships.

> ④ To realize such agriculture, completely unmanned agriculture and plants growing on Mars will become a hot topic.

⑶ **Topic 3.** Wouldn't a city on Mars declare an independent state?

⑷ **Topic 4.** Why the U.S. raised Elon Musk and he is still not constrained

> ① Elon Musk can make America's infinite glory come true.

> ② What you learn from history is that there are always stages of decline when there is a golden age.

> ③ But Mars exploration is a game changer that can change the corollary of history.

> ④ However, space industry competition will be triggered due to China and Russia, and the risk of war may increase.

> ⑤ In the meantime, space scientists may be making a lot of money.
