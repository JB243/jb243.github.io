§ The higher the topic, the more basic it is.

<br>

## **Philosophy**

**1.** [What is knowledge?](https://nate9389.tistory.com/387) 

> ⑴ Isn't Goedel's theorem of imperfections not applicable to a three-stage argument that is too obvious? What does Goedel's incomplete theorem prove?

<br>

**2.** [What is justice?](https://nate9389.tistory.com/2273) 

<br>

**3.** Is there a meaning to life?

> ⑴ It may seem rather sacred because it is meaningless.

> ⑵ Nietzsche referred to emotional as Dionysos and rational as Apollon. He said that the purpose of life may be to seek to become more valuable by building intelligence (Apollon), or to explore a wider fantasy world through free imagination (Dionysos). 

>> ① From a slightly different perspective, Dionysian qualities seem to align with intuition-based decisions, while Apollonian qualities resemble conviction-based decisions.

> ⑶ [For a forever fun world](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2424)

>> ① Art needs to be more stubbornly artistic.

<br>

**4.** Nature is precisely determined by calculus, and human behavior is finely determined by game theory.

> ⑴ Therefore, the rules of nature are continuous, and the rules of society are discrete.

> ⑵ Social rules are discrete because they are governed by game theory.

> ⑶ Discreteness is an emergent property observed at the societal level. For example, the characteristic of discreteness is exemplified by the tendency of people to form groups to gain strength.

> ⑷ There is a claim that discreteness arises from the non-linear activation function in neural networks.

> ⑸ It may be because intelligent beings tend to choose only the maximum or minimum solutions.

<br>

**5.** A dynamic world is fundamentally a happy one.

> ⑴ Because through change, we can dream of hope.

>> ① Most people are deeply interested in upward social mobility.

> ⑵ A pluralistic society is dynamic, whereas a monolithic society is static.

>> ① A diversified society does not line people up, so people are happier.

>> ② Society can be happier if it can present appearances with various charms instead of lookism.

> ⑶ In a static world without any crises, people's spirits tend to grow weaker.

> ⑷ Religion is fundamentally static and resembles nihilism in that it shows little interest in this world.

> ⑸ Political ideologies must always evolve.

<br>

<br>

## **Self-development**

**6.** The advancement of humanity must be eternal. This is because if humanity ceases to advance, our energy will act in a direction that destroys us.

> ⑴ Personal Growth

>> ① Similarly, a person thirsty for growth should never stop growing. This is because that explosive energy will turn inward.

>> ② If a politician stops growing, their political career is over.

>> ③ A person changes when they stop growing. Do you not have people around you who have changed? Why did they change fundamentally? Some people grow forever.

>> ④ There are some people who, paradoxically, never change because they are constantly growing.

> ⑵ The Growth of Humanity

>> ① Perhaps humanity is cursed with the need to develop endlessly.

>> ② However, humanity can grow forever, as the amount of knowledge is [infinite](https://jb243.github.io/pages/387).

<br>

**7.** A person lives to realize his or her self. 

> ⑴ People realize what they are good at by comparing themselves to others and establishing themselves.

> ⑵ Picasso is said to have already completed the painting level at the age of five. But isn't it that he's interested in Cubism that the well-drawn masterpieces are too obvious and there's no new area to try?

<br>

**8.** A pessimist is ultimately one who has ceased to grow.

> ⑴ Why are pessimists bad?

>> ① If there are no more facts to criticize, a pessimist criticizes the absence of facts to criticize.

>> ② Similarly, pessimists criticize perfect people for lacking humanity.

>> ③ Optimists have qualities that attract people, but pessimists fail to get along even with those who are similar.

>> ④ Visionaries and critics are quite incompatible.

> ⑵ It's easy to think negatively. 

> ⑶ Once you start thinking negatively, you can continue to think negatively endlessly.

> ⑷ [I cannot logically refute a pessimist driven by conviction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2273#6-my-concept-of-justice). 

>> ① This is because two independent and stable logical systems are not logically superior to each other in terms of their mutual contradictions.

> ⑸ Once an arrogant pessimist seemed ridiculous, their words no longer reached my ears.

<br>

**9.** On success and failure

> ⑴ The speed of growth

>> ① The development of a person is also an example of punctuated equilibrium. It is called 'motive'. 

<br>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55747737/198045495-d7b26edb-21e3-4e9d-a3a9-1191e7185f61.png" alt="drawing" style="width:400px;"/>

The growth of punctuated equilibrium of multinational enterprises 

<br>

>> ② If one overcomes failure, trials, solitude, and heartbreak, they become admirable; if they succumb, they become strange. Paradoxically, failure is an essential ingredient for awakening and success.

>> ③ Human growth is so great that it can even change causality or go against nature's providence.

>> ④ Life is the art of possibility. Life is sometimes impulsive rather than strategic.

> ⑵ There exists an objective measure of growth.

>> ① It is the accumulation of knowledge, which is unique to humans unlike other animals.

>> ② Similarly, the growth of societies or civilizations can also be defined.

>> ③ It is not money. However, money can be a good motivator.

>> ④ Knowledge fades if left unattended, so not only the amount of accumulated knowledge but also the speed of its generation is important.

> ⑶ Without pain, humans cannot grow.

>> ① A man becomes the strongest when he or she is alone. 

>> ② Because they get bored easily.

>> ③ The glass ceiling is not meant to lock yourself up. It's meant to be broken.

>> ④ The world has never felt easy. The experiences strengthened me.

>> ⑤ Conceit stops growth.

>> ⑥ There are not many opportunities for growth. Thus, one needs to find his or her opportunity.

>> ⑦ Solitude and trials strengthen intuition, and that leads to irreversible growth in a person.

>> ⑧ The very reason you chose life at the crossroads of life and death means you are destined to become a king.

> ⑷ There are no prodigies in life.

>> ① Similarly, there are no prodigies in politics either.

>> ② In the end, you have to learn by facing challenges and experiencing failures.

>> ③ Instead of wasting time on regrets, sharpen your focus and push yourself a little further. Time is precious, and success is always far away.

<br>

**10.** On greed

> ⑴ By entropy, this world is not a good environment to bear lives. I think greed in people is the strength to survive and the motive to develop in this uncompromising world. So greed is not necessarily bad.

> ⑵ Love changes easily, but greed doesn't change. Therefore, you must mix greed in love not to make it changed.

> ⑶ However, there is no positive advantage in showing inferiority and envy to others.

> ⑷ The combination of desire and philosophy is really powerful.

> ⑸ Desire for knowledge is a healthier desire than other desires.

> ⑹ The ultimate desire is to have no desire.

<br>

**11.** On Happiness 

> ⑴ If you look forward to tomorrow when you close your eyes, isn't that happiness?

> ⑵ A life with news is proof that you are well off.

> ⑶ Happiness is having an unexpected encounter in an unexpected place.

> ⑷ In the end, a happy person is someone who knows how to be happy.

> ⑸ If a person can enjoy even failure, heartbreak, and uncertainty, they are already living a blessed life — because there is no longer any reason to be unhappy.

>> ① Curiosity and a sense of adventure may be emotions that naturally developed to survive in an uncertain world.

> ⑹ Happiness that depends on many variables is difficult to last long.

>> ① Since human relationships are constantly changing, seeking happiness in them is bound to lead to trouble.

>> ② Sometimes, there are relationships that don’t change, and in those moments, you can just find it amusing and interesting.

>> ③ Since the proposition 'everything changes' is itself subject to change, it cannot be regarded as an absolute truth.

> ⑺ Happiness should be sought within oneself, not from others.

>> ① Without sufficient training of intuition, you may mistake happiness defined by others for your own happiness.  

>> ② This is related to the mechanism of manipulation.

>> ③ Being overproud is being overscarce.

<br>

**12.** One should have a philosophy to build huge wealth. The reasons are as follows.

> ⑴ Because a greater value is needed, as it is not beneficial to society that social resources are concentrated on certain individuals.

>> ① A greater value and kindness are alike—in that even with a few mistakes, they can still be forgiven.

> ⑵ Because justification is needed for those who may feel deprived and jealous when social resources are concentrated on specific individuals.

> ⑶ Because it needs a value that surpasses the violation of the anti-trust regulation act. 

<br>

**13.** If you are in your country, you are evaluated as a job, and if you go abroad, you are evaluated as an achievement.

<br>

**14.** The most obvious strategy for success is: the more, the better.

> ⑴ Because the utility by work is exponential. For example, it is possible to work three times more and earn ten times more.

> ⑵ Because, if we grow quantitatively, we grow qualitatively as well.

> ⑶ However, when speed and direction are matched, the probability of success increases.

> ⑷ When it comes to applying, the more, the better. We can't control whether we get accepted, but we can control how many applications we submit.

> ⑸ Refer to [Endogenous Growth Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2020).

<br>

**15.** The ant's law that 70% of the population don't work does not apply to humans. Because humans are special.

<br>

**16.** It's a waste of time even to blame someone.

<br>

**17.** If you have walked your path endlessly with sharp determination, you will become a truly unique being.  

> ⑴ The fake envies the real.  

> ⑵ Fake madness cannot surpass true madness.

> ⑶ I don't need others to agree with who I am. - Itaewon Class

<br>

**18.** Curiosity is the ability to define problems, something AI cannot do.

<br>

**19.** When you want to do something, you find a way. When you don't, you find an excuse. 

<br>

**20.** The word "overwhelming gap" always warms my heart.

<br>

**21.** Being swayed back and forth and changing one's convictions is a sign of a weak person.

> ⑴ Similarly, being placed in a dilemma is also evidence of weakness.

> ⑵ To avoid falling into dilemmas, one must exercise the uniquely human ability of creativity. The absence of creativity places us in dilemmas.

<br>

**22.** On Humility  

> ⑴ Success is more influenced by luck than we often realize. Your success may not last forever.  

> ⑵ If you have a lot to protect, you must be humble. Having enemies can reduce your gains.  

> ⑶ If you have a lot to learn, you must be humble. Arrogance hinders the acquisition of new knowledge.

<br>

**23.** No one lives in the same world.

> ⑴ If there are a hundred people, there are a hundred colors and a hundred stories.

> ⑵ People with dark irises have difficulty seeing in low light compared to those without, but they are more resistant to glare.

> ⑶ The world is not fair. Some people are born with an abundance of blessings, while others face continuous challenges every moment.

> ⑷ However, this world is well-designed and offers rewards for overcoming trials.

>> ① Those who experience many trials can give hope to others and gain momentum through their growth as they overcome.

>> ② Just as there is as much sky as there is land, there is as much joy as there is sorrow.

<br>

**24.** On intuition 

> ⑴ Intuition is the ability to read a situation. It's similar to the concept of Observation Haki in the manga One Piece.

> ⑵ Instinct and intuition also need to be trained. Even those with a strong sense of intuition couldn't predict my next move.

>> ① I suppose it's because instinct is nothing more than big data from the past.

>> ② The assessment of intuitive judgments must be made through reasoning, as it is necessary to determine whether intuition requires training.

>> ③ To strengthen your intuition, you need to trust yourself.

>> ④ Solitude is highly effective in training instinct and intuition. Unfortunately, men have more opportunities to experience solitude than women.

> ⑶ Intuitive judgments are always faster than rational judgments. And time is always in short supply.

> ⑷ Understanding myself is also important. 

>> ① You need to know how to listen to your own voice and emotions. It's common to mistake others' opinions for your own thoughts. 

>>> ○ In other words, you shouldn’t rely on others for value judgments, and intuition is also needed to distinguish whether it’s your own voice or someone else’s.

>> ② Defense mechanisms and cognitive dissonance can interfere with our intuition.

>> ③ One must acknowledge that, at least partially, others' intuition may be correct.

>>> ○ For example, "That’s not what I meant, but others misunderstand me." is partially wrong.

>>> ○ However, if you acknowledge that the other person's intuition was correct and simply submit to it, you may lose your negotiating power.

> ⑸ Intuition also has direction and intensity.

> ⑹ Isn't precognitive dreaming also related to intuition?

<br>

**25.** On decision

> ⑴ Decisions are generally made based on one of three main cases.

>> ① Mistakes made due to a failure to properly read the situation: These can be improved by training one’s intuition.

>> ② Instinctive judgments made after correctly reading the situation: These may not lead to great success and can result in living a life driven by external forces rather than one’s own.

>>> ○ It is called [Bayesian inference](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2160).

>> ③ Judgments made based on conviction after properly reading the situation: These carry risks, but if you can take pride in the decision itself, you’ll be able to recover even in the face of failure. Therefore, this is the kind of decision one should aim to make.

>>> ○ It is called logical reasoning or symbolic deduction.

>>> ○ Keep in mind that for some people, following inertia may itself be a form of conviction.

>>> ○ You can even intuit beliefs.

> ⑵ Making decisions is inherently difficult.

>> ① Life is a series of choices, and we don't have much time.

>> ② Because making wise decisions requires, first and foremost, an accurate reading of the situation.

>> ③ Even decisions require fine-tuning. However, when reading a situation through intuition, the feedback you receive comes from what you feel. However, there are times when a decision offers no feedback at all. That’s why having a clear philosophy is crucial.

>>> ○ **Example 1:** “I fully understand this person, so I can treat them however I want” (×) → “I fully understand this person, so I want to help guide them in the right direction.” (○)

>>> ○ **Example 2:** Some people study for a certain exam for over ten years and still don’t understand what went wrong.

> ⑶ On conviction

>> ① [The Power of Conviction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/869): Conviction strengthens a person from within, giving them the power to change their surroundings.

>> ② Strong conviction drives a person to take on more work, creating a "the more, the better" effect. For reference, the more work you do, the more exponentially the results tend to grow.

>> ③ Each decision made based on conviction shapes the course of our lives.

>>> ○ I hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story. The most compact compact and meaningful will be the serious choices you have made. In. the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story. (`Jeff Bezos`)

>> ④ Intuition is also needed to distinguish whether a conviction is truly your own or one that has been instilled by others.

>>> ○ For example, choosing not to marry (non-marriage) cannot, in itself, be considered a conviction.

>> ⑤ Conviction is similar to passion.

>> ⑥ When conviction and intuition align, they create synergy.

>>> ○ In general, good (or virtuous) convictions and intuition tend to point in the same direction. This might be why altruism exists.

>>> ○ If someone finds passion in their work, it's likely that their conviction (which resembles their passion) and their intuition (about what they should do) are also aligned.

>> ⑦ Perhaps the reason we need conviction, logic, and a sense of greater purpose is to solidify the philosophy we've chosen and to maintain self-objectivity.

>> ⑧ When following the legacy, the benefits adhere to an all-or-none principle. When one takes a creative path, the benefits are proportional, meaning the rewards match the effort.

>> ⑨ Dynamic beliefs are better than static ones. Therefore, beliefs should be abstract.

>> ⑩ There is an appropriate number of beliefs one should hold. First of all, having beliefs is better than having none. If you have too few, you may lose your way when they fail to come true. But if you have too many, they may end up conflicting with one another.

> ⑷ On Challenges and Courages**  

>> ① The reason why we need to take on challenges

>>> ○ There is an optimal ratio for taking on challenges. This ratio is determined by the surrounding environment and an individual's temperament. The optimal ratio can be found through intuition.

>>> ○ People tend to underestimate potential gains and overestimate potential risks. Therefore, encouraging challenges is necessary to overcome this natural tendency. ([ref](https://youtube.com/shorts/eaVlg2FQMfA?si=X9OEqeKAwexY39jl))

>>> ○ Failing 5 times out of 10 is more beneficial than failing once out of 2.

>>>> ○ Just as there is as much sky as there is earth, there is as much success as there is failure. And just as the sky is wider than the earth, success—though it may come less often than failure—ultimately brings rewards that make up for it.

>>> ○ It is also to discover talent or new possibilities.

>>>> ○ Courage is similar to curiosity or a sense of adventure. No matter how strong your intuition is, you can't understand everything — that's why irrational courage sometimes seems necessary.  

>>>> ○ You don't know the depth of the sea until you dive in.

>>> ○ Important decisions that shape life may sometimes seem irrational at the time.

>>>> ○ Encouraging someone to take on challenges doesn’t mean recklessly charging into things that seem impossible. It means trusting the rules you've discovered for yourself.  

>>>> ○ Irrational decisions made in a state of excitement often lead to poor outcomes. This is a result of failing to properly utilize intuition.

>>>> ○ Shouldn’t this be understood not so much as a gamble, but as the discovery of a subtle signal that had not yet clearly emerged?

>>>> ○ The path one forges through challenges can also shape their identity.

>>>> ○ *"[For an Eternally Interesting World](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2424)"*  

>> ② The target of a challenge

>>> ○ Courage is required even for a no-go decision. And intuition is needed when determining what constitutes a no-go.  

>>> ○ People themselves are not the target of a challenge — they are too unpredictable. However, if the challenge itself feels like a source of pride, it’s worth pursuing.  

>>> ○ Gambling is not the taget of a challenge. If we become addicted to gambling at a casino, it means the casino system is stronger than our intuition.

>> ③ Appropriate arrogance helps in facing challenges.

>>> ○ How can a challenge approached with fear succeed? Sometimes, thinking lightly can lead to better outcomes.

>>> ○ Think of yourself as a winner. Then you will win. - Donald J. Trump ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2296))

>> ④ Respect to all who challenge, and blessings to those who overcome.

>> ⑤ There are paths where I want to run at full speed without looking back.

>>> ○ I've always wanted to be an adventurer. And today I realized that I am already living that life.

>>> ○ At some point, I found myself enjoying the failures as well. After all, they are part of the adventure.

>>> ○ It's more beneficial to the world to charge ahead at full speed on the path I want to take without looking back, rather than taking care of others.

> ⑸ On attraction

>> ① Many of the most important decisions in life are not made through numbers and analysis, but through instinct, intuition, attraction, and impulse. ([ref](https://youtube.com/shorts/dt5qxBZzFEE?si=p-W0GPEqdlru0IdM))  

>> ② I hope the reason for my choices is not because I feel grateful or sorry, but because I genuinely like and am proud of the choices I've made.  

>> ③ A truly good decision is one made with full awareness of the possibility of failure — and one you can still be proud of, even if it fails.

>>> ○ Therefore, if you regret a failure you faced with your whole life on the line, it raises the question of whether you truly accounted for the possibility of failure in the first place.

<br>

**26.** On exercise

> ⑴ Health improves, and since the results are visibly noticeable (e.g., your body actually gets fitter), overall life satisfaction increases.  

> ⑵ Paradoxically, even though it takes time, your stamina improves so much that you end up having more time and using it more efficiently.  

> ⑶ Endorphin and dopamine release help refresh your mood.  

> ⑷ Since your mind temporarily clears, it becomes easier to switch contexts.  

> ⑸ Your personality improves. Many conflicts happen simply because people are physically exhausted.  

> ⑹ You become more curious, as curiosity is a cognitive function that demands a lot of energy.

> ⑺ You can exercise alone.

<br>

**27.** The Benefits of Keeping a Light Mind

> ⑴ It's easier to accept new ideas.

> ⑵ Context switching becomes faster (accelerated thinking).

> ⑶ The power of intuition grows stronger.

> ⑷ Since most memories fade anyway, keeping a light mind helps retain only what’s truly important.

> ⑸ A heavy mind consumes more energy and makes the body feel heavier too.

<br>

<br>

## **Relationship**

**28.** On Kindness and Anger  

> ⑴ It’s better to be wicked than weak  

>> ① Too many people exploit the desire to be good.  

>> ② Being busy is close to being wicked.  

>> ③ Busyness is relative. If someone is truly worth your time, you can make time for them no matter how objectively busy you are.  

>> ④ I would advise Yeong-hye from 「The Vegetarian」 not to be a kind victim but a selfish adventurer.  

>> ⑤ No matter how good I am, there is 30% anti-fans. Also, no matter how wrong I am, there are 30% fans.

> ⑵ Kindness is difficult.

>> ① Jeff Bezos’ Quote:

>>> "One day, you understand that it's harder to be kind than clever. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy because they are given after all, choices can be hard. Will you be clever at the expense of others? Or, will you be kind?"  

>> ② **Benefit of kindness**

>>> ○ The primary reason we seek to be kind is to build relationships.

>>> ○ Gaining trust from others can be advantageous in the long term. ([ref](https://youtube.com/shorts/LDNo0sZQiUY?si=0JxsNeLci6OtGbg8))

>>> ○ Kindness is necessary to control arrogance.

>>> ○ A greater value and kindness are alike—in that even with a few mistakes, they can still be forgiven.

>> ③ **Risk of kindness** 

>>> ○ Others may see you as an easy target. This could later undermine your negotiation power within the organization. ([ref](https://youtube.com/shorts/qWN7W3GNNZo?si=dNG01OqvNUMFe0uk))

>>> ○ Some may exploit this kindness for rude demands or try to dominate us by labeling us as timid. That is why kindness requires courage. Be kind to those who appreciate it, but show the arrogant how formidable you can be.  

>>>> ○ A narcissist who seeks to control others uses fear, a sense of responsibility, and guilt. ([ref](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LDsStdjhUGI))

>>> ○ To know if someone is appreciative, intuition is required.

>>> ○ I'm basically not kind. And I'm not generous toward the arrogant.

>> ④ There exists an optimal ratio of kindness.  

>>> ○ This ratio is determined by both the surrounding environment and individual temperament.  
   
>>> ○ The more kind people around you, the more beneficial it is to increase this ratio.  
   
>>> ○ If being kind to others enhances your life satisfaction, increasing this ratio is also advantageous.  

> ⑶ I am interested in people who care about me and respect me.  

>> ① I don’t get particularly angry at rude people because I can't afford to waste my energy unnecessarily.  

>> ② The reason why those who think they can dominate me just because they are captivated by their own charm are wrong is that the moment they act that way, I lose interest, and their premise no longer holds.  

>> ③ An adventurer never misses the moment to set off. And they never regret it.

> ⑷ Anger is a signal for escaping danger.

>> ① Anger is useful for correcting misplaced hierarchies.  

>> ② Being told *not* to get angry doesn’t mean you shouldn’t feel injustice—it means you should express your anger in a sophisticated manner.  

>> ③ It often feels like anger only leaves behind regret. Learning to express it in a refined way is crucial, and this too requires training.  

>> ④ Composed emotions, gentleness, and adherence to principles create authority.  

>> ⑤ Once you've obtained everything you aimed for, there’s no reason to remain angry. Anger driven by inferiority seems unnecessary.  

>> ⑥ Dissatisfaction and anger are the strongest intuitions that signal something is going wrong.  

>> ⑦ Jeff Bezos : Stress primarily comes from not taking action.

> ⑸ Anger as a driving force for success  

>> ① I'm not better than others; I'm just angrier than them.

>> ② [Bang Si-hyuk’s Commencement Speech at Seoul National University](https://www.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2019/02/26/2019022603880.html)

>> ③ Still, I’d rather be remembered as someone fun than as someone constantly angry.

<br>

**29.** It is a virtue to do a lot in the Science of Nature, and it is a virtue to take a balance in the Science of Human.

> ⑴ It is related to Nash Equilibrium in social science.

> ⑵ Human relationships may not be give and take. However, the work is clearly give and take.

<br>

**30.** When you go out into society, it is meaningless whether a particular person is good or bad. It only matters whether the person is profitable or not.

<br>

**31.** Like the wings of Icarus, relationships between people are not good if they are too close.

<br>

**32.** Humans aren’t naturally suited to living alone, but with awareness, they can learn to do so.

> ⑴ Being born as an animal and becoming a higher intellectual being also mean that people are unstable.

> ⑵ What I fear most isn’t being alone, but my life becoming boring.

<br>

**33.** A dream dreamt alone is just a dream, but a dream dreamt together is reality.

<br>

**34.** Human nature tends to neglect its own possessions and covet those of others.

⑴ Therefore, someone who loves no one can potentially be loved by everyone.

<br>

**35.** When one turned 60, he or she realized that no one cared about him or her.

<br>

**36.** The relationship between a startup and its early employees is similar to a long-term romance or a first love. Because of the "reasons why it's hard to break up" and the "reasons why you should break up."

<br>

**37.** Trust is a priceless resource. Once lost, you can never get it back.

> ⑴ Trust amplifies the effectiveness of policies. ([Policy Game Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2043))

> ⑵ Betrayal offers only short-term gains, whereas building trust is advantageous in the long term.

<br>

**38.** The clown sheds tears behind the mask.

<br>

**39.** Just as irregular frequency can strengthen the intensity of memory, it can also enhance the strength of human relationships.

<br>

**41.** On relationship

⑴ On love

> ① Love is an experience in which others become part of themselves.

> ② Love must be eternal and superior.

>> ○ Just as electromagnetic wave becomes complete as electric and magnetic fields complement each other, love will be such.

>> ○ Eternal love certainly exists. However, I don't take it for granted. All I can do is enjoy even that uncertainty.

> ③ If you really like someone, you should also have the courage to let go.

>> ○ If there’s someone you want to keep by your side, set her free. If she stays close to you even in freedom, she is already yours.

> ④ Paradoxically, those who love themselves receive more love from others.

⑵ On a fatal relationship

> ① Only when you are alone, you can see a fateful relationship.

> ② The person next to you is the fateful relationship, not the person whom you find as the fateful relationship separately.

> ③ Relationships that rely on conditions are difficult to sustain. Let’s focus on the present state, not the future state.

⑶ There is only contradiction in humans anyway. The important thing is when you notice the other person's contradiction.

> ① The reason why contradictions occur in people is that they take two or more values as a premise.

> ② As the distance between people gets closer, people's contradictions begin to appear.
 
> ③ Everyone has their own faults.

> ④ Therefore, you should focus on yourself rather than on others.

⑷ On obsession

> ① There is no need to be obsessed with human relationships. Being alone is natural, and if someone chooses to be with you, simply appreciate it and be grateful, as if receiving a gift.  

> ② Individuals are unpredictable and not suitable objects of obsession, but could the market be? 

>> ○ Example: Jeff Bezos' customer-centrism

⑸ Once you decide to break up, hundreds of reasons to leave come to mind.

> ① The fact that there are many reasons not to maintain human relationships means that it is difficult to sustain them.

> ② While a relationship is being maintained, the problem is not easily noticeable. It seems that when human relationships are formed, the criteria for value judgments are fine-tuned.

> ③ Humans have an instinct to blur their vision in order to form interpersonal relationships.

<br>

**41.** Marriage is a process of combining properties in many ways, and therefore there are many similarities with M&A.

<br>

**42.** Hatred is similar to fear.

<br>

**43.** The reason someone's pride gets scratched often implies that their self-esteem isn't actually that high.

<br>

**44.** People definitely change.

⑴ Is saying that people don’t change just a way to justify giving up on them easily?  

⑵ Or is it because some people change easily while others are more resistant to change?  

<br>

<br>

## **Theory of Monarchs**

**45.** Kings still exist. This is advice for those who walk the path of a king.

> ⑴ Irregulars exist in this world, distorting the space and time around them. May you understand the weight of your crowns.

<br>

**46.** The paradox of a dictator

> ⑴ Since the benefits of political power are concentrated only on a few, the dictator basically causes the majority's discontent.

> ⑵ The reason why a dictator takes the path of a war monarch is to resolve people's dissatisfaction through economic growth.

> ⑶ However, there is a way to become a technological powerhouse in addition to becoming a war monarch.

<br>

**47.** There are royal roads and apostles on the way to success.

> ⑴ An example of apostles is that they have secured many minor but loyal customers.

> ⑵ But how did Elon Musk become king by walking the apostle?

<br>

**48.** The king must be lonely.

> ⑴ First, it is because it is always lonely to pioneer a new paradigm and a new market.

> ⑵ Second, it is because only those who walk lonely paths can win public support.

> ⑶ Third, the king is not a job, but a sudden fate.

>> ① The moment you realize that the rules of the world you discovered were right, you will experience an irreversible awakening and grow rapidly.

> ⑷ Fourth, this world does not welcome the emergence of a king, for he seeks to bring about great change.

> ⑸ So if you're lonely, you're also walking the path of a king.

> ⑹ If a special person doesn't want to be lonely, he or she has to make the world a better place and find someone who can admit the value you follow.

>> ① Eventually, only the unfortunate genius who knows the secrets of the world changes the world.

>> ② Few people can confidently describe themselves as great people. But wouldn't you be able to confidently say you're a special person?

>> ③ An altruist is at a disadvantage over an egoist, but in the end, he is empowered by people around him believing in his true feelings.

>> ④ People empower those who believe they can.

> ⑺ So I decided to walk their path with the hope that the giants who move this world would not feel lonely. And I decided to go in search of the king.

<br>

**49.** The king is special.

> ⑴ The king is neither a lawyer nor a doctor. The king is a king.

> ⑵ The king must meet the queen.

> ⑶ There are not many kings. Perhaps there cannot be more than one king in a kingdom as there cannot be two suns in a sky.

> ⑷ And kings are those who walk on paths that no one has ever walked on and go on paths that no one has ever reached.

> ⑸ A king does not waver, for he does not seek approval — and so his convictions remain unchanged.

<br>

**50.** There are three kinds of kings in the world.

> ⑴ A king who rules the people with authority and power. 

> ⑵ A king with a free soul.

> ⑶ A king who doesn’t even know he is a king. I'm looking for the third type of king.

<br>

**51.** Change always comes from the outside.

> ⑴ [Studying abroad is a great journey in search of hope.](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2194)

<br>

**52.** It's not a here if one didn't have a crisis.

> ⑴ Life is dramatic after all. The person who dramatically overcame the crisis wins in the end rather than the person whose everything is perfect.

> ⑵ Crisis always comes with opportunity.

>> ① It is the same when experiencing the pain of a breakup and the sting of betrayal.

> ⑶ Every opportunity is sometimes dangerous. Like any fire, if used improperly, it can cause burns.

<br>

**53.** Hero never die. If he or she was dead, it's not a hero already.

> ⑴ One is not special because they overcome hardships and adversity; they are special because they have overcome hardships and adversity.

> ⑵ To stay alive, you must never stop growing. Paradoxically, those who grow endlessly are the ones who never truly change.

<br>

**54.** Leaders with poor background build leadership based on strong will. And it's superior.

<br>

**55.** The world is well-made. In the end, those who walk on an unnamed path dominate the world.

> ⑴ One Piece Animation: The world is well-made. Like Roger wasn't a man of ability.

One Piece Vol. 1047

<br>

**56.** A lot starts to be seen when authority is laid down.

<br>

**57.** Rather than forcing beliefs, it is desirable to spread them according to market principles.

<br>

**58.** God is one, and there are only several representatives of God.

<br>

**59.** Those who have gained tremendous wealth from self-made work have succeeded with two partial successes.

> ⑴ This was especially the case with Softbank Chairman Masayoshi Son, Kakao Chairman Kim Bum-soo, Elon Musk, and Steve Jobs.

> ⑵ In terms of time, they achieved success in their 20s and 30s and success in their 40s and 50s.

> ⑶ In particular, Chairman Masayoshi Son set a very specific goal when he was young, and he realized it all.

<br>

**60.** The king must speak the king's language.

<br>

**61.** The truth of this world conveyed by those who have reached the peak of the world can serve as an opportunity to resolve conflicts between classes.

<br>

**62.** There are many obstacles in the way of the king.

<br>

**63.** Fish in an aquarium are happy when they do not know the vastness of the ocean.

The Tower of God 

<br>

**64.** There is no one who dislikes a strong king.

<br>

**65.** Sometimes there are those who long for the battlefield.

> ⑴ [Kaido from One Piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Y1x7j7SvE&t=203s): Only war determines human worth.

> ⑵ David from The Walking Dead New Frontier: A soldier isn't a husband... Or a father. A soldier is a soldier... Nothing else.

> ⑶ The reason is that, in a mature society, individuals who had previously not been paid much attention—such as sensitive people (for example, women)—gain strength, while tough individuals lose their sense of self-worth. Therefore, a society that has stopped growing and is merely mature harbors inherent risks.

<br>

<br>

## **Social science**

**66.** It is difficult to define even a single individual easily.

⑴ Are fingernails, composed of dead cells that have undergone complete keratinization, considered part of our body?

⑵ I can be an individual self, but I can also be a collective self or a societal self.

> ① In this world, there are some people who live a life as a public good, not a life of a private person. Those who choose to believe in their philosophys should be rewarded.

⑶ From the perspective of the societal self, there is nothing on the news that is not related to me.

⑷ Some people consider not only individuals but also the collective intelligence of humanity as their friend.

<br>

**67.** There are three reasons why people need society.

> ⑴ First, a newborn child cannot live without parents.

> ⑵ Second, people have instincts like social animals.

> ⑶ Third, people belonging to a group are stronger than people who do not belong to a group.

<br>

**68.** Identifying wrongdoing reduces contradictions within a group, but we should be cautious as it can undermine the stability of the group.

> ⑴ It is wrong to be absolutely zero tolerance for wrongdoing because people can make mistakes.

> ⑵ There are more adults who make wrongdoings than you think. Because adults no longer believe in the values they believed in when they were young.

> ⑶ However, it is unjust to make contradictions to reduce contradictions. Therefore, excessive reform is also wrong.

> ⑷ The more principled a manager is, the healthier the organization is. This is because contradictions of the group are reduced and there is no harm to the stability of the group.

<br>

**69.** Learning is divided into science and art. A study of humanities is involved in art. 

<br>

**70.** Social science is the science of responsibility because it is related to consensus and policy, and natural science is the science of humility because it is related to objectivity.

<br>

**71.** I am politically neutral. However, voting is mandatory for me.

> ⑴ **Reason 1.** It is inefficient if the scientific and industrial sectors that require large investments are unnecessarily dominated by political pressure.

>> ① However, this reason does not seem to apply much to Elon Musk. Earlier this year, he saw President Biden intentionally passing Tesla Motors in the electric vehicle market and tweeted in anger to drive out Joe Biden, which does not seem to shake Elon Musk's position.

>> ② The reason why the U.S. raised Elon Musk and still does not restrict him is that Elon Musk can realize the infinite glory of the U.S. What you learn from history is that there is always a phase of decline when you have your heyday. However, if the U.S. monopolizes several planets alone, the U.S. potential will exceed that of all other countries. The reason why it is expressed as 'potential' here is that the United States will not unnecessarily stimulate competitors. 

> ⑵ **Reason 2.** Real politics, after all, is self-contradictory.

> ⑶ **Reason 3.** Only those who form a new force can eventually pioneer a new paradigm and a new market.

> ⑷ **Reason 4.** Because it is not desirable for the fruits of science and technology or new paradigms to pass on political beliefs to the same people.

> ⑸ For this, I should aim for the future rather than the present for political neutrality.

>> ① However, some dreamers and thinkers go to extremes because they are far from reality. 

> ⑹ For this, I should aim for integration rather than division.

<br>

**72.** The roles of politicians are largely classified in two ways.

> ⑴ Decrease of social conflict costs

> ⑵ Guarantee of one's right to life

> ⑶ In general, it is the domain of politicians to prevent short-term economic fluctuations. And it is the realm of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs that drive long-term economic growth.

<br>

**73.** I think politics and history are examples of punctuated equilibrium. Therefore, an attitude to explain history by dividing it into a specific period rather than a continuous flow is reasonable.

<br>

**74.** The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is that the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry.

> ⑴ Opportunity cost means the most valuable thing that you have given up for a choice. The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is that the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry. Obviously, all people's activities will have similar economic importance if they develop to a high level, but because of the logic of comparative advantage by opportunity cost, investment or development is focused on only areas that prosper at the moment.

<br>

**75.** The hierarchy of jobs causes social discontent. That is the driving force behind enterpreneurs with unnamed jobs.

<br>

**76.** A nation is a unit that maximizes economies of scale by sharing languages, history, culture, and industry. At the same time, it is a huge group that creates a sense of belonging, identity, and an evironment where people can live like humans.

<br>

**77.** There may be a moment when you have to seriously think about a company without employees, a school without students, and a country without population.

<br>

**78.** A healthy industry should be in a form where both skilled and unskilled workers can participate.

> ⑴ That is the case with the automobile industry.

> ⑵ The IT industry consists of 100% skilled workers, which is believed to have an inherent problem.

<br>

**79.** Computer engineering majors learn technology, while economics majors learn the world.

<br>

**80.** As society matures, professional occupations gain more power. South Korea has become quite a mature society. However, maturity is not necessarily a good thing.

> ⑴ However, society must continue to grow rather than mature.

<br>

**81.** Biology is closer to social science than to physics or chemistry. The reason for this is diversity, heterogeneity, and interaction.

<br>

**82.** The role of future programmers can be diagnosed as follows:

> ⑴ **Role 1:** Development of LLM models - Not realistic

>> ① Developing LLM models requires a considerable scale of servers, making it difficult unless the scale is as large as OpenAI, Meta, or Google.

>> ② Even companies like Naver and Kakao have not achieved that scale.

>> ③ Some predict that ChatGPT 4.0 might be the final version of an LLM unless companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google combine their efforts.

> ⑵ **Role 2:** Fine-tuning

>> ① The model is already established, and a significant amount of specific training data is provided to improve the model for a specific field.

>> ② Example: [ChatGPT fine-tuning](https://wikidocs.net/200282)

> ⑶ **Role 3:** Crawling from databases and tagging with LLM

> ⑷ **Role 4:** [Prompt engineering](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2317)

> ⑸ **Role 5:** Integrating pre-existing models with various front-end and back-end systems for different services.

<br>

**83.** There are three major problems in Korea.

> ⑴ Low birth rate of 0.82 per couple

>> ① There are four main causes of low birth in Korea.

>>> ○ Population overcrowding due to the concentration of population in the capital area.

>>> ○ Increase of education cost.

>>> ○ A lack of impetus in economic growth.

>>> ○ A career break for women.

>> ② There are five main solutions of low birth in Korea.

>>> ○ Local investment.

>>> ○ Development the ultimate and best knowledge system. 

>>> ○ Promotion of new industries.

>>> ○ Transition of childcare teachers to public officials and national guarantee of infant education facilities attached to the workplace.

>>> ○ Active support for infertility policy and _in vitro_ fertilization

> ⑵ The fact of the only divided country in the world

> ⑶ The highest plastic usage

<br>

**84.** Innovation is a game making losers.

<br>

<br>

## **History science**

**85.** The Korean people are those who have never invaded. So it is a special and chosen people, especially in the globalized world.

<br>

**86.** History science has a different rule than game theory that explains social science.

<br>

**87.** To build a predictable history, leaders must be honest and sincere.

<br>

**88.** If you know history, you don't feel rushed by time. The same goes for human relationships.

> ⑴ A gentleman’s revenge is never too late, even after ten years.

<br>

<br>

## **Futurology**

**89.** Science has constantly increased the quality of life.

> ⑴ It is hard to agree that science should be avoided just because it constantly create problems.

> ⑵ It's because bigger problems arise without science and technology than new problems arise with science and technology. For example, problems arise when society is stagnant, just as water rots when it is stagnant.

<br>

**90.** Humanity is progressing irreversibly.

> ⑴ Progress is good because it makes humanity worthwhile.

> ⑵ Water rots when it is stagnant. Therefore, human progress must last forever.

> ⑶ For example, space technology can develop as much as the size of the universe.

> ⑷ It is certainly advance of humanity that jobs are becoming diverse and complicated.

<br>

**91.** Science and technology transcend good and evil.

<br>

**92.** The difference between science and technology is that

> ⑴ Even if the material is the same,

> ⑵ Technology makes hiding a virtue and science makes disclosure a virtue.

> ⑶ Technology aims to foster new industries and complete existing industries (e.g. 99% → 99.9%),

> ⑷ Science aims to complete the Tower of Babel of Human Knowledge, answer countless questions, and think about what mankind should go on.

> ⑸ While technology aims to solve a given problem, science aims to define a new problem.

> ⑹ However, perhaps the distinction between science and technology is more of a social consensus than a strict one.

<br>

**93.** There are three reasons why K-content is currently popular in OTT (e.g., Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney Plus, Amazon Studios, etc.).

> ⑴ Because the Korean people have a 'good' image as non-invasion people.

> ⑵ Because Korea has freedom of thought; the impetus seems to come from the overwhelming distribution of IT devices.

> ⑶ Because Korea has experienced a rapid economic rise, giving a sense of homogeneity to developed countries and a sense of reverence to underdeveloped countries.

<br>

**94.** The next-generation innovative science field is diagnosed with five as follow. These fields share the commonality of being high-context disciplines with a significant amount of information.

> ⑴ Bio

> ⑵ Environment

> ⑶ Space

> ⑷ Quantum mechanics: quantum computers, fusion power, particle physics

> ⑸ IT: However, it's becoming difficult to view IT as an innovation industry because now there is no field that IT isn't involved in.

<br>

**95.** Giant industries are linked to human desires.

> ⑴ The field of IT is linked to entertainment.

> ⑵ The field of law is linked to frequent disputes between people.

> ⑶ The field of medicine is linked to the desire to live a healthy and long life.

> ⑷ The field of beauty is linked to the desire to be superior to others.

> ⑸ The field of space is linked to pure curiosity. So I think it's a special industry.

<br>

**96.** Industry is work places.

> ⑴ Can an IT industry that destroys other jobs and threatens the jobs of related workers be called an industry?

<br>

**97.** Biological trends are largely divided into two flows. That is the area of bioinformatics combine with data science and art such as chemical biology.

<br>

**98.** In the past, it is said that birds listen to day words and rats listen to night words. But the strange thing is, these days there are no birds or mice.

<br>

**99.** The more mechanized and automated civilization is, the more important the realm of art becomes.

<br>

**100.** Artificial intelligence does not have the innocence of a child.

<br>

**101.** There are four reasons why eco-friendly energy is important.

> ⑴ Now, the Russian-Ukraine war has threatened that Russia will not supply the world with energy. In the end, it is necessary to realize energy independence from the standpoint of energy security.

> ⑵ There has been some consensus that the global environment is destroyed by people. Eco-friendly marketing certainly works, and no one can easily refute it even if they set up trade barriers with emphasis on the environment.

> ⑶ The unit price of eco-friendly energy production continues to fall. In 100 years, all energy will be used as eco-friendly energy, so shouldn't we consider switching to eco-friendly energy from now on?

> ⑷ Green energy emphasizes scientific capabilities compared to other types of energy. Therefore, there is a high possibility that new industries will grow or start-ups and star entrepreneurs will emerge. There's already Solar City, as well, and it shows us that the focus on private enterprises rather than governments promotes job creation and huge economic growth. It also means that there are many things to study scientifically, so it can create other value-added industries.

<br>

**102.** Environmental problems should be solved by economic logic, not ethics.

> ⑴ Why has the environmental sector not been industrialized among the innovation fields? Why is a politician in that position instead of a businessperson?

<br>

**103.** Ten years from now, SpaceX's Starship reaches Mars. ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fxaAENrZYw)) What do we have to prepare for that?

> ⑴ **Topic 1.** Microbiome

>> ① There's no better way to make Mars a viable planet than microbes.

>> ② In fact, it was a microbe called cyanobacteria that generated oxygen on Earth when there was no oxygen in the air.

> ⑵ **Topic 2.** Agriculture 

>> ① It is important to exploit resources on Mars, and it seems more realistic to transport organic materials than heavy metals by spaceships.

>> ② Organic materials can be used as food, but it can also be used as an energy source.

>> ③ Energy source is important because they can be sold on Earth or used for spaceships.

>> ④ To realize such agriculture, completely unmanned agriculture and plants growing on Mars will become a hot topic.

> ⑶ **Topic 3.** Wouldn't a city on Mars declare an independent state?

> ⑷ **Topic 4.** Why the U.S. raised Elon Musk and he is still not constrained

>> ① Elon Musk can make America's infinite glory come true.

>> ② What you learn from history is that there are always stages of decline when there is a golden age.

>> ③ But Mars exploration is a game changer that can change the corollary of history.

>> ④ However, space industry competition will be triggered due to China and Russia, and the risk of war may increase.

>> ⑤ In the meantime, space scientists may be making a lot of money.
