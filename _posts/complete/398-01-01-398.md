## **1.[Histone Modification](https://jb243.github.io/pages/74)**

> ○ Overview

>> ○ Among histones, H3 is most frequently modified: H2A and H2B are much less frequently modified

>> ○ Histone modification occurs on histone tails

> ○ H2AK119Ub

>> ○ Related to DDR (DNA damage response)

> ○ H2BK5me1 

>> ○ Activates gene transcription

> ○ H2BK5me3

>> ○ Represses gene transcription

> ○ H3K4me1

>> ○ Enhancer and promoter: Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K4me3

>> ○ A modification where three methyl groups (me3) are attached to the 4th lysine (K) residue of the histone protein

>> ○ Active promoter: Activates gene transcription

>> ○ Particularly in the brain, positively correlated with H3K27ac and negatively correlated with H3K27me3

>> ○ **Example 1.** Gpr88 shows high H3K4me3 modification in the striatum → Increased expression

> ○ H3K9ac

>> ○ Active promoter: Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K9me1

>> ○ Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K9me2 

>> ○ Represses gene transcription

> ○ H3K9me3

>> ○ Heterochromatin silencing: Represses gene transcription

> ○ H3K14ac

>> ○ Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K27ac

>> ○ A modification where an acetyl group (ac) is attached to the 27th lysine (K) residue of histone H3

>> ○ Enhancer and promoter: Activates gene transcription

>> ○ Particularly in the brain, positively correlated with H3K4me3 and negatively correlated with H3K27me3

>> ○ **Example 1.** Gpr88 shows high H3K27ac modification in the striatum → Increased expression

> ○ H3K27me1

>> ○ Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K27me2

>> ○ Represses gene transcription

> ○  H3K27me3

>> ○ A modification where three methyl groups (me3) are attached to the 27th lysine (K) residue of histone H3

>> ○ Polycomb repression: Represses gene transcription

>> ○ Particularly in the brain, negatively correlated with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac

>> ○ **Example 1.** Genes involved in GABAergic regulation during synaptic signaling show high H3K27me3 modification

>> ○ **Example 2.** Genes involved in glutamatergic regulation during synaptic signaling show low H3K27me3 modification

>> ○ **Example 3.** The Car2 gene shows high H3K27me3 modification in the cerebral cortex compared to the corpus callosum and striatum

>> ○ **Example 4.** Related to DDR (DNA damage response)

> ○ H3K27me1

>> ○ Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K27me3

>> ○ Polycomb silenced promoter: Represses gene transcription

> ○ H3K36me3

>> ○ Transcribed gene body, transcription elongation: Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K79me1

>> ○ Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K79me2

>> ○ Promoter activity: Activates gene transcription

> ○ H3K79me3

>> ○ Activates or represses gene transcription 

> ○ H4K20me1

>> ○ Activates gene transcription

> ○ Mecp2

>> ○ Exclusive reader of non-CpG methylation
