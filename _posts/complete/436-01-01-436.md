## **1\. Overview**

 ⑴ **Advantage 1.** Easy to implement backend in app development, etc.

 ⑵ **Advantage 2.** Well-developed deep learning tools

 ⑶ **Advantage 3.** Various applications possible based on open community

 ⑷ **Advantage 4.** Excellent data visualization

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Syntax**

⑴ Python can return multiple values simultaneously

⑵ `pass` or `...`: Used when code is syntactically required but no action is needed.

⑶ `yield` returns values one at a time when needed, rather than all at once

⑷ You can write multi-line code by using backspace `\` for line breaks

⑸ A single-line string is represented by "~" or '~', and a multi-line string is represented by """~""" or '''~'''

⑹ `adata.var_names=[i.upper() for i in list(adata.var_names)]`

> ① Meaning **:** In adata.var_names, each i in list(data.var_names) is stored in uppercase

⑺ `if issparse(counts.X):counts.X=counts.X.A`

> ① Meaning **:** If counts.X is a sparse matrix, the value of counts.X.A is assigned to counts.X

⑻ `pd.DataFrame([(str(i),str(j)) for i in range(4) for j in range(i+1, 4)])`

<br>

```python
	0	1
0	0	1
1	0	2
2	0	3
3	1	2
4	1	3
5	2	3
```

<br>

⑼ **Broadcasting**

> ① A feature in NumPy that allows operations between arrays of mismatched dimensions

> ② A small array (as long as it has a dimension of 1) is automatically expanded to match the larger array's shape, and then the operation is performed

> ③ Data is not physically copied to match the small array to the large array

<br>

```python
# Shape of `exp_log_mu`: (2257, 6)
# Shape of `theta_mn`: (6, 13344)

exp_log_mu_expanded = exp_log_mu[:, :, np.newaxis]   # Shape: (2257, 6, 1)
theta_mn_expanded = theta_mn[np.newaxis, :, :]       # Shape: (1, 6, 13344)    
result = exp_log_mu_expanded * theta_mn_expanded     # Shape: (2257, 6, 13344)
```
