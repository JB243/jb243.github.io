## **1. The characteristics of the brain**  

⑴ Immersed in cerebrospinal fluid within the skull and protected by three layers of meninges (pia mater, arachnoid mater, dura mater).

⑵ The human brain is composed of approximately 100 to 200 billion neurons.

> ① Number of neurons by species:

>> ○ C. elegans (302)

>> ○ Fruit fly (~150,000)

>> ○ Zebrafish (~5 million)

>> ○ Mouse (~71 million)

>> ○ Zebra finch (~131 million)

>> ○ Octopus (~500 million)

>> ○ Marmoset (~636 million)

>> ○ Rhesus macaque (~6.4 billion)

>> ○ Human (~86 billion)

>> ○ Elephant (~257 billion)

⑶ Supported by glial cells, which are about 10 times more numerous than neurons.

⑷ Human brain weight: about 2% of body weight (1,200–1,400 g).

⑸ Human brain volume: approximately 1,400 mL; in great apes, around 400 mL.

⑹ Metabolism: consumes about 20% of total oxygen and 20% of total blood flow.

⑺ The brain uses energy at a rate of 10 to 60 watts: approximately 0.1 nanowatts per neuron.

⑻ The brain uses only glucose as an energy source; if glucose is not continuously supplied, the brain's glucose stores are depleted within 10 minutes

⑼ Staining techniques: Golgi, Nissl, Weigert

> ② Neuronal growth and connection to target cells begin during embryonic development and are strengthened through learning and training.

> ③ Only some neurons can regenerate after injury: if neuronal debris or the cell body is absent, regeneration is not possible.

⑶ Classification of Neurons

>> ○ Covers the nodes of Ranvier to prevent axonal exposure.

>> ○ Reabsorbs excess potassium ions around neurons.

>> ○ Absorbs glutamate and converts it into glutamine.

## **4. Resting membrane potential**

⑴ Membrane potential is the inner-membrane electrical potential relative to the outer-membrane electrical potential. (unit : ㎷)

⑵ The equilibrium states of resting membrane potential is -70 ㎷.

> ① An uneven distribution of ions around the cell membrane.

> ② The selective transparency of the cell membrane (Na<sup>+</sup> < K<sup>+</sup>): Some K<sup>+</sup> channels are open

> ③ Na<sup>+</sup>/ K<sup>+</sup> pump : It moves 3 molecules of Na<sup>+</sup> outside the cell and moves 2 molecules of K<sup>+</sup> inside the cell.

> ④ The attractive force by the negative-charged proteins in the cell

⑶ Nernst Equation

<br>

<img width="275" height="56" alt="스크린샷 2025-08-17 오후 5 40 18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25efae94-e450-445a-b8f8-d0c055f770b5" />

<br>

> ① Derivation: G = −RT lnQ = −nFE

> ② Interpretation

>> When the concentration of ions is higher inside the cell than outside, an **osmotic potential** exists that drives ions outward.

>> Since the system is at equilibrium, there must be a counteracting force that pulls ions inward.

>> This opposing force is the electrical potential generated when the inside of the membrane is negatively charged (E < 0) and the outside is positively charged (E > 0).

>> For the same reasons described in section ⑵, this electric potential exists and maintains the asymmetry of the ion's osmotic potential.

> ③ Applications

>> ○ When K<sup>+</sup> is added to the extracellular fluid, the K<sup>+</sup> pump pumps K<sup>+</sup> into the cell, resulting in an increase in resting membrane potential.

>> ○ Note: If only K<sup>+</sup> is present, adding more K<sup>+</sup> does not affect the resting membrane potential.

>> ○ The higher the concentration of external ions (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>), the lower the membrane potential, leading to a decrease in action potential frequency.

>> ○ The higher the concentration of internal ions (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>, as in hyperkalemia), the higher the threshold becomes, making action potentials easier to trigger.

>> ○ Conversely, the lower the internal ion concentration (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>, as in hypokalemia), the lower the threshold becomes, leading to reduced action potential frequency.

⑷ Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Equation

<br/>

<img width="647" height="66" alt="스크린샷 2025-08-17 오후 5 39 50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77d6b61e-857e-43ab-9227-fcddce31d3a2" />

<br/>

> ① The Nernst equation calculates the equilibrium potential when only one ion is involved.

> ② In reality, the actual membrane potential is influenced by the permeability (P) and distribution of multiple ions, each contributing differently depending on the cell membrane's permeability to each ion.

> ③ Examples of Equilibrium Potentials:

>> ○ E<sub>K⁺</sub> = −88 mV

>> ○ E<sub>Na⁺</sub> = +53 mV

>> ○ E<sub>Ca²⁺</sub> = +145 mV

>> ○ E<sub>Cl⁻</sub> = −58 mV

> ④ The resting membrane potential tends to be close to the equilibrium potential of the ion with the highest electrical conductance.

<br>

<br>

## 5. Graded Potential vs Action Potential

⑴ Graded Potential (Stepwise Potential): The membrane potential changes in proportion to the influx of ions.

⑵ Action Potential: Always induces a membrane potential change of constant magnitude.

⑶ Magnitude: The farther it propagates, the smaller the magnitude becomes vs. the magnitude is always constant.

⑷ Channels: Ligand-gated channels vs. Voltage-gated channels.

> ① The total number of channels is greater at sites that generate action potentials.

⑸ Related Ions: Na<sup>+</sup> (excitatory), K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> (inhibitory) vs. Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>.

⑹ Location: Dendrites, cell body of the neuron vs. axon.

> ① In the axon hillock, both graded potentials and action potentials are involved.

<br>

<br>

## **6. Generation of action potential**

⑴ Law of All-or-None: Action potentials follow the all-or-none principle.

⑵ Channels

> ① Na<sup>+</sup> channel: Has both activation gate and inactivation gate.

> ② K<sup>+</sup> channel
   
> ③ Channel opening duration: Na<sup>+</sup> channel < K<sup>+</sup> channel
   
> ④ Channel opening speed: Na<sup>+</sup> channel > K<sup>+</sup> channel

⑶ 1<sup>st</sup>. Resting State (Equilibrium State)

> ① Na<sup>+</sup> channel: activation gate closed, inactivation gate open.
  
> ② K<sup>+</sup> channel: closed.

⑷ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Graded Potential

> ① When Na<sup>+</sup> enters from a neighboring axon, a small number of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels open.

> ② Opened voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels induce the opening of other closed voltage-gated Na⁺ channels.

⑸ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Depolarization

> ① Threshold potential: -40 to -50 mV. Depolarization beyond this threshold is required for an action potential to occur.

> ② Na<sup>+</sup> channel: activation gate open, inactivation gate closed.

> ③ K<sup>+</sup> channel: closed.

⑹ 4<sup>th</sup>. Falling Phase

> ① Na<sup>+</sup> channel: activation gate open, inactivation gate closed (immediately after reaching +30 mV).

> ② K<sup>+</sup> channel: just before reaching +30 mV, K<sup>+</sup> efflux causes membrane potential to fall.

> ③ Astrocytes regulate the rate of K<sup>+</sup> efflux.

⑺ 5<sup>th</sup>. Repolarization

> ① Na<sup>+</sup> channel: activation gate closed, inactivation gate closed.

> ② K<sup>+</sup> channel: open.

> ③ Absolute refractory period present.

⑻ 6<sup>th</sup>. Hyperpolarization

> ① Na<sup>+</sup> channel: activation gate closed, inactivation gate open.

> ② K<sup>+</sup> channel: in the process of closing

> ③ Slowly returns to -70 mV through mechanisms restoring the resting membrane potential

> ④ Relative refractory period present

⑼ Refractory Period

> ① Time during which K<sup>+</sup> ions exit the axon and the membrane potential returns to -70 mV.

> ② Absolute refractory period: From the moment the membrane potential exceeds threshold until repolarization occurs

>> ○ No action potential can be generated regardless of stimulus intensity

>> ○ h-gate (inactivation gate) is closed
   
> ③ Relative refractory period: Beginning with hyperpolarization

>> ○ h-gate (inactivation gate) is open, m-gate (activation gate) is closed.

>> ○ A very strong stimulus can depolarize the membrane beyond threshold, opening the activation gate and generating an action potential

⑽ Action Potential Patterns Depending on Extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> Concentration

⑾ Inhibitors

> ① Tetrodotoxin (TTX): Irreversibly inhibits voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels.

>> ○ Found mainly in the ovaries and liver of pufferfish.

>> ○ Pufferfish themselves are resistant due to a mutation in their Na⁺ channel protein (just a single amino acid difference).

> ② Tetraethylammonium (TEA): Blocks voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels.

> ③ Botox: Inhibits voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the neuromuscular junction → prevents acetylcholine release → causes muscle paralysis

> ④ CPZ: Reduces or inhibits neurotransmitter release.

<br>

<br>

## 7. Conduction of active potential

⑴ Local Current Mechanism: Depolarizes neighboring regions and forms a threshold potential, leading to regenerative conduction.

⑵ Unidirectional Conduction: The region where an action potential has occurred is in the refractory period, so conduction proceeds only in one direction.

⑶ Saltatory Conduction

> ① Myelination

>> ○ Myelin is gradually formed until about one year after birth.

>> ○ Oligodendrocytes: Extend processes that wrap around nearby nerve fibers to form myelin.

>> ○ Schwann cells: The entire cell wraps itself around the nerve fiber to form myelin.

>> ○ Myelin is formed as the axon is tightly wrapped in layers. This wrapping occurs when opposing cell membranes come into near contact, creating a double-membrane structure. The principal component of myelin is lipid, which is also the main constituent of cell membranes.

>> ○ Because myelin is formed in this manner, gaps remain, known as the nodes of Ranvier.

> ② Myelin as an Insulator → Action potentials form only at unmyelinated regions → Conduction speed increases.

>> ○ The time required for action potential generation equals the time for localized diffusion of sodium and potassium ions.
 
>> ○ Axons are wrapped with insulating myelin to prevent action potentials from being generated at every segment.

> ③ Saltatory Conduction: The phenomenon in which action potentials “jump” from one node of Ranvier to the next.

>> ○ At the nodes of Ranvier: Voltage-gated ion channels are present → active propagation.

>> ○ Between the nodes of Ranvier: No voltage-gated ion channels → passive propagation.

>> ○ Saltatory conduction occurs when the potential at the nodes of Ranvier reaches and maintains above threshold, generating an action potential.

⑷ Conduction Velocity

> ① 135 m/s

> ② The larger the nerve diameter, the faster the conduction speed.

> ③ In humans, a microcurrent of about 39 mA flows through the nerves.

<br>

<br>

## **8. Chemical synapse**

⑴ Synapse

> ① **Type 1:** Electrical Synapse

>> ○ **Features:** Bidirectional, gap junctions (connexons), very fast, narrow synaptic cleft

>> ○ **Examples:** Cardiac muscle, central nervous system

> ② **Type 2:** Chemical Synapse

>> ○ **Features:** Unidirectional, wide synaptic cleft, transmission through neurotransmitters.

>>> ○ Presence of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (required for neurotransmitter release).

>>> ○ Neurotransmitters are removed by reuptake into presynaptic neurons.

>> ○ Nicotinic receptor: Fast response, related to ion channel opening in postsynaptic neurons.

>> ○ Muscarinic receptor: Slow response, related to second messenger signaling in postsynaptic neurons.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The stimulated presynaptic neuron releases glutamate.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Glutamate binds to AMPA receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. AMPA receptors open, Na<sup>+</sup> enters, and depolarization occurs; depolarization in the postsynaptic neuron is proportional to the stimulus.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. When strong depolarization occurs in the postsynaptic neuron, Mg<sup>2+</sup> blocking the NMDA receptor channel is removed (in the presence of glutamate).

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. NMDA receptors open, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the postsynaptic neuron.

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts as a second messenger, increasing NO synthase activity and generating nitric oxide (NO).

>> ○ 7<sup>th</sup>. NO increases the number of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane.

>> ○ 8<sup>th</sup>. NO additionally acts as a retrograde messenger, diffusing back to the presynaptic neuron.

>> ○ 9<sup>th</sup>. The presynaptic neuron releases more glutamate.

> ② Synaptic Changes: Positive feedback mechanism.

> ③ Functional Changes: Strengthened synaptic transmission.

> ③ The learning and memory in the cerebellum

>> ○ The cerebellum is one-tenth of the cerebrum in size but is equal in the number of neurons.

>> ○ Input: PF(parallel fiber), CF(climbing fiber); It represents address.

>> ○ Output: PC(purkinje cell); There is the change of synaptic strength.
