## **1. The characteristics of the brain**  

⑴ Immersed in cerebrospinal fluid within the skull and protected by three layers of meninges (pia mater, arachnoid mater, dura mater).

⑵ The human brain is composed of approximately 100 to 200 billion neurons.

> ① Number of neurons by species:

>> ○ C. elegans (302)

>> ○ Fruit fly (~150,000)

>> ○ Zebrafish (~5 million)

>> ○ Mouse (~71 million)

>> ○ Zebra finch (~131 million)

>> ○ Octopus (~500 million)

>> ○ Marmoset (~636 million)

>> ○ Rhesus macaque (~6.4 billion)

>> ○ Human (~86 billion)

>> ○ Elephant (~257 billion)

⑶ Supported by glial cells, which are about 10 times more numerous than neurons.

⑷ Human brain weight: about 2% of body weight (1,200–1,400 g).

⑸ Human brain volume: approximately 1,400 mL; in great apes, around 400 mL.

⑹ Metabolism: consumes about 20% of total oxygen and 20% of total blood flow.

⑺ The brain uses energy at a rate of 10 to 60 watts: approximately 0.1 nanowatts per neuron.

⑻ The brain uses only glucose as an energy source; if glucose is not continuously supplied, the brain's glucose stores are depleted within 10 minutes

⑼ Staining techniques: Golgi, Nissl, Weigert

> ② Cell body (soma)

>> ○ Contains nucleus, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, etc.

>> ○ The nucleus is located in the center, and within the center of it is a distinct nucleolus.

>> ○ Rich in ribosomes, so it is stained by basic dyes.

>> ○ Nissl body

>>> ○ Stained rough endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes and granular endoplasmic reticulum, appearing in a leopard-spot pattern.

>>> ○ The dye used for Nissl staining is a basic dye.

⑵ Formation of Neurons

> ① Approximately 86 billion neurons exist; synapses number around 10<sup>14</sup>–10<sup>15</sup>.

> ② Neuronal growth and connection to target cells begin during embryonic development and are strengthened through learning and training.

> ③ Only some neurons can regenerate after injury: if neuronal debris or the cell body is absent, regeneration is not possible.

⑶ Classification of Neurons

> ① By function

>> ○ Afferent neuron (sensory neuron): delivers information to the central nervous system through the dorsal region of the spinal cord.

>> ○ Efferent neuron (motor neuron): transmits information from the central nervous system through the ventral region of the spinal cord.

>> ○ Interneuron: connects afferent and efferent neurons.

> ② By presence of axon

>> ○ Type I: with axon; generates action potential; includes motor and sensory neurons.

>> ○ Type II: without axon; does not generate action potential; includes interneurons.

> ③ By presence of myelin sheath (Schwann cells)

>> ○ Myelinated nerve: motor and sensory neurons in vertebrates.

>> ○ Unmyelinated nerve: neurons in invertebrates, interneurons in vertebrates.

⑷ Types of Neurons

> ① Unipolar neuron:

>> ○ Has dendrite and axon extending in one direction.

>> ○ Found in invertebrates.

> ② Pseudo-unipolar neuron:

>> ○ A single axon branches into two, functioning separately as dendrite and axon.

>> ○ Example: sensory ganglion cells of the spinal ganglion.

> ③ Bipolar neuron:

>> ○ Has one dendrite and one axon extending from the cell body.

>> ○ Example: retinal cells, olfactory cells.

> ④ Multipolar neuron:

>> ○ Has one axon and multiple dendrites extending from the cell body.

>> ○ Example: most neurons.

> ④ Function

>> ○ Provides physical support.

>> ○ Covers the nodes of Ranvier to prevent axonal exposure.

>> ○ Reabsorbs excess potassium ions around neurons.

>> ○ Absorbs glutamate and converts it into glutamine.

>> ○ Maintains the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by forming tight junctions that block substance movement: The BBB can be understood as being formed by tight junctions in capillaries.

## **4. Resting membrane potential**

⑴ Membrane potential is the inner-membrane electrical potential relative to the outer-membrane electrical potential. (unit : ㎷)

⑵ The equilibrium states of resting membrane potential is -70 ㎷.

> ① An uneven distribution of ions around the cell membrane.

> ② The selective transparency of the cell membrane (Na<sup>+</sup> < K<sup>+</sup>): Some K<sup>+</sup> channels are open

> ③ Na<sup>+</sup>/ K<sup>+</sup> pump : It moves 3 molecules of Na<sup>+</sup> outside the cell and moves 2 molecules of K<sup>+</sup> inside the cell.

> ④ The attractive force by the negative-charged proteins in the cell

⑶ Nernst Equation: E = E<sub>in</sub> - E<sub>out</sub> = (RT / ZF) * ln(X<sub>out</sub> / X<sub>in</sub>)

> ① Derivation: G = −RT lnQ = −nFE

> ② Interpretation

>> When the concentration of ions is higher inside the cell than outside, an **osmotic potential** exists that drives ions outward.

>> Since the system is at equilibrium, there must be a counteracting force that pulls ions inward.

>> This opposing force is the electrical potential generated when the inside of the membrane is negatively charged (E < 0) and the outside is positively charged (E > 0).

>> For the same reasons described in section ⑵, this electric potential exists and maintains the asymmetry of the ion's osmotic potential.

> ③ Applications

>> ○ When K<sup>+</sup> is added to the extracellular fluid, the K<sup>+</sup> pump pumps K<sup>+</sup> into the cell, resulting in an increase in resting membrane potential.

>> ○ Note: If only K<sup>+</sup> is present, adding more K<sup>+</sup> does not affect the resting membrane potential.

>> ○ The higher the concentration of external ions (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>), the lower the membrane potential, leading to a decrease in action potential frequency.

>> ○ The higher the concentration of internal ions (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>, as in hyperkalemia), the higher the threshold becomes, making action potentials easier to trigger.

>> ○ Conversely, the lower the internal ion concentration (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>, as in hypokalemia), the lower the threshold becomes, leading to reduced action potential frequency.

⑷ Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Equation

<br/>

E = E<sub>in</sub> - E<sub>out</sub> = 60 × log10(
 &nbsp;&nbsp;P<sub>k</sub> × [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>out</sub> + P<sub>Na</sub> × [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>out</sub> + P<sub>Cl</sub> × [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>out</sub>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------------------------------
 &nbsp;&nbsp;P<sub>k</sub> × [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>  + P<sub>Na</sub> × [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>  + P<sub>Cl</sub> × [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>in</sub>
) (mV)

<br/>

> ① The Nernst equation calculates the equilibrium potential when only one ion is involved.

> ② In reality, the actual membrane potential is influenced by the permeability (P) and distribution of multiple ions, each contributing differently depending on the cell membrane's permeability to each ion.

> ③ Examples of Equilibrium Potentials:

>> ○ E<sub>K⁺</sub> = −88 mV

>> ○ E<sub>Na⁺</sub> = +53 mV

>> ○ E<sub>Ca²⁺</sub> = +145 mV

>> ○ E<sub>Cl⁻</sub> = −58 mV

> ④ The resting membrane potential tends to be close to the equilibrium potential of the ion with the highest electrical conductance.

<br>

## **5\. The generation of the active potential**

⑴ It follows the law of "all or none".

⑵ Resting state

> ① Sodium channel **:** Activation gate is closed and inactivation gate is open at this step.

⑶ Depolarization

> ① Threshold potential **:** -40 ~ -50 ㎷, Depolarization should make the membrane potential exceed the threshold potential in order to generate the active potential.

> ② Sodium channel **:** Activation gate is open and inactivation gate is closed at this step.

> ③ Potassium channel **:** It is closed at this step.

⑷ Repolarization

> ① Sodium channel **:** Activation gate is open and inactivation gate is closed (right after the membrane potential hits 30 ㎷)

> ② Potassium channel **:** When the membrane potential hits 30 ㎷, repolarization begins by the leakage of the potassium ion.

> ③ Astrocyte begins to lower the concentration of the potassium ion.

⑸ Hyperpolarization

> ① Sodium channel **:** Activation gate is closed and inactivation gate is open at this step.

> ② Potassium channel : It is closing at this step.

> ③ By the mechanism of restion membrane potential, the membrane potential returns to -70 ㎷ slowly.

⑹ Refractory period

> ① The period from the potassium ion moves outside the axon and the membrane potential returns to -70 ㎷

> ② Absolute refractory period **:** In this period, it is impossible to regenerate the active potential no matter how big the stimulus is. It is related to the inactivation gate.

> ③ Relative refractory period **:** In this period, it is possible to regenerate the active potential. It is related to the activation gate.

<br>

<br>

## **6\. The conduction of the active potential**

⑴ Regenerative conduction **:** It generates the active potential by depolarizing the adjacent position.

⑵ Because the position in which the active potential already passes is in refractory period, the active potential conducts in one way.

⑶ Saltatory conduction

> ① Myelination

>> ○ Myelin is slowly formed for a year after birth.

>> ○ Oligodendrocyte : It makes encompassing myelin around the neuron by extending its protuberance.

>> ○ Schwann cell : It makes encompassing myelin by rolling itself up around the neuron.

>> ○ Myelin is made from the double-layer membrane and the main component of myelin is lipid which is also abundant in the membrane.

>> ○ The boundaries of the oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells is also the boundaries of myelin and this boundary is called "node of Ranvier".

<center>(C) The cross section of the node of Ranvier</center>

<center>(B) The nucleolus looks a black dot.</center>

<br>

> ② Myelination is insulation. Thus the active potential is generated at nodes of Ranvier and the conduction speeds considerably improved.

>> ○ The period to generate the active potential is the period to diffuse the sodium ion and the potassium ion locally.

>> ○ Not to generate the active potential all axon long, most position of axon should be insulated.

> ③ Saltatory conduction **:** It means that the active potential jumps to the next node of Ranvier at all steps.

⑷ The bigger the diameter of the nerve is, the faster the conduction is.
