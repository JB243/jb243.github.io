## **1. The characteristics of the brain**  

⑴ Immersed in cerebrospinal fluid within the skull and protected by three layers of meninges (pia mater, arachnoid mater, dura mater)

⑵ The human brain is composed of approximately 100 to 200 billion neurons

⑶ Supported by glial cells, which are about 10 times more numerous than neurons

⑷ Human brain weight: about 2% of body weight (1,200–1,400 g)

⑸ Human brain volume: approximately 1,400 mL; in great apes, around 400 mL

⑹ Metabolism: consumes about 20% of total oxygen and 20% of total blood flow

⑺ The brain uses energy at a rate of 10 to 60 watts: approximately 0.1 nanowatts per neuron

⑻ The brain uses only glucose as an energy source; if glucose is not continuously supplied, the brain's glucose stores are depleted within 10 minutes

⑼ Staining techniques

## **4. Restion membrane potential**

⑴ Membrane potential is the inner-membrane electrical potential relative to the outer-membrane electrical potential. (unit : ㎷)

⑵ The equilibrium states of restion membrane potential is -70 ㎷.

> ① The nonhomogenous distribution of ions around the cell membrane.

> ② The selective transparency of the cell membrane (Na<sup>+</sup> < K<sup>+</sup>)

> ③ Na<sup>+</sup>/ K<sup>+</sup> pump : It moves 3 molecules of Na<sup>+</sup> outside the cell and moves 2 molecules of K<sup>+</sup> inside the cell.

> ④ The attractive force by the negative-charged proteins in the cell

⑶ Nernst equation

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/b8vXqD/btrz36dvoZx/05nPCXxdsrvEsbKCTa69I1/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<br>

## **5\. The generation of the active potential**

⑴ It follows the law of "all or none".

⑵ Resting state

> ① Sodium channel **:** Activation gate is closed and inactivation gate is open at this step.

⑶ Depolarization

> ① Threshold potential **:** -40 ~ -50 ㎷, Depolarization should make the membrane potential exceed the threshold potential in order to generate the active potential.

> ② Sodium channel **:** Activation gate is open and inactivation gate is closed at this step.

> ③ Potassium channel **:** It is closed at this step.

⑷ Repolarization

> ① Sodium channel **:** Activation gate is open and inactivation gate is closed (right after the membrane potential hits 30 ㎷)

> ② Potassium channel **:** When the membrane potential hits 30 ㎷, repolarization begins by the leakage of the potassium ion.

> ③ Astrocyte begins to lower the concentration of the potassium ion.

⑸ Hyperpolarization

> ① Sodium channel **:** Activation gate is closed and inactivation gate is open at this step.

> ② Potassium channel : It is closing at this step.

> ③ By the mechanism of restion membrane potential, the membrane potential returns to -70 ㎷ slowly.

⑹ Refractory period

> ① The period from the potassium ion moves outside the axon and the membrane potential returns to -70 ㎷

> ② Absolute refractory period **:** In this period, it is impossible to regenerate the active potential no matter how big the stimulus is. It is related to the inactivation gate.

> ③ Relative refractory period **:** In this period, it is possible to regenerate the active potential. It is related to the activation gate.

<br>

<br>

## **6\. The conduction of the active potential**

⑴ Regenerative conduction **:** It generates the active potential by depolarizing the adjacent position.

⑵ Because the position in which the active potential already passes is in refractory period, the active potential conducts in one way.

⑶ Saltatory conduction

> ① Myelination

>> ○ Myelin is slowly formed for a year after birth.

>> ○ Oligodendrocyte : It makes encompassing myelin around the neuron by extending its protuberance.

>> ○ Schwann cell : It makes encompassing myelin by rolling itself up around the neuron.

>> ○ Myelin is made from the double-layer membrane and the main component of myelin is lipid which is also abundant in the membrane.

>> ○ The boundaries of the oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells is also the boundaries of myelin and this boundary is called "node of Ranvier".

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/PsEDk/btrzZzIf26B/5gPsHlIJibWkvTXDWnfdPk/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center>(C) The cross section of the node of Ranvier</center>

<center>(B) The nucleolus looks a black dot.</center>

<br>

> ② Myelination is insulation. Thus the active potential is generated at nodes of Ranvier and the conduction speeds considerably improved.

>> ○ The period to generate the active potential is the period to diffuse the sodium ion and the potassium ion locally.

>> ○ Not to generate the active potential all axon long, most position of axon should be insulated.

> ③ Saltatory conduction **:** It means that the active potential jumps to the next node of Ranvier at all steps.

⑷ The bigger the diameter of the nerve is, the faster the conduction is.

<br>

<br>
