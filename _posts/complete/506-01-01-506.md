## **1. Unsolved Difficult Problems**

⑴ [Wikipedia List of Unsolved Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics)

⑵ Collatz conjecture

> ① Prove that when transforming a number n by dividing by 2 if it is even, and transforming to 3n+1 if it is odd, this sequence eventually converges to 1.

⑶ P vs NP Problem

> ① Terminology

> > ○ Deterministic algorithm: An algorithm that considers only one possibility at each step of computation

> > ○ Nondeterministic algorithm: An algorithm that considers ***two or more*** possibilities at each step of computation

> > > ○ A nondeterministic algorithm is a theoretical concept and cannot be implemented on an actual computer

> > > ○ It can consider multiple possible paths simultaneously at each step, and assumes that it "luckily" chooses the correct path among them

> > > ○ You can think of an adventurer using a cloning technique at each step to search for the optimal path ([ref](https://gazelle-and-cs.tistory.com/64))

> > > ○ Therefore, even if the adventurer does not have the ability to clone, if at each point someone gives a hint about which way to go and the hint can be verified, one can similarly search for the optimal path 

> > > ○ Therefore, a nondeterministic algorithm can be said to be equivalent to a deterministic algorithm that verifies some hint in polynomial time

> > ○ **P problems**: = Problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic algorithm

> > > ○ Interpreting “could not solve the problem” as meaning “cannot be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic algorithm”

> > ○ **NP problems**: = Problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic algorithm = Problems that can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic algorithm

> > ○ **NP-hard**: Problems to which every problem in NP is polynomial-time many-one reducible to another problem 

> > > ○ It can be said to be a problem made harder than NP problems

> > ○ **NP-complete**(NP complete): The set of problems such that problem A is in NP, and at the same time every problem in NP is polynomial-time many-one reducible to it.

> ② Definition

> > ○ Since deterministic algorithms ⊂ nondeterministic algorithms (e.g., one correct choice and one random choice at each step), it follows that P problems ⊂ NP problems

> > ○ The P vs NP problem must prove whether NP problems are identical to P problems, have more elements, or even whether that cannot be proven

> > ○ NP problems = (P problems) + (NP-complete problems) + (NP problems that are not NP-complete if P≠NP)

> ③ Examples

> > ○ Shortest path problem between two cities: P problem. Solved by Dijkstra, [Floyd Algorithm](https://jb243.github.io/pages/61), etc.

> > ○ Greatest common divisor computation problem: P problem. Solved by the Euclidean algorithm

> > ○ [Sorting problem](https://jb243.github.io/pages/130): P problem. Solved by bubble sort, quick sort, etc.

> > ○ Prime factorization: It has not been proven whether it is NP-complete, not NP-complete, or unprovable

> > ○ Traveling salesman problem (TSP, traveling salesman problem): NP-complete problem. Given multiple cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting city

> > ○ Fragment orientation problem (FOP): NP-complete. In bioinformatics, the problem of correctly determining the orientation of DNA fragments

> > ○ Super Mario Bros: NP-hard

>> ○ RNA secondary structure prediction problem allowing pseudoknots or long-range constraints: NP-complete or NP-hard.

>> ○ [Finding a subset that is both maximally spread out and maximally informative](https://research.google/blog/introducing-gist-the-next-stage-in-smart-sampling/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social_post&utm_content=gr-acct): NP-hard 

>> ○ Steiner tree algorithm: NP-hard

⑸ Triangulation Orchard Problem

⑹ [Mathematical formula that explains the number of structural isomers of alkanes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2412) ([ref](https://www.quora.com/The-number-of-isomers-for-alkanes-is-defined-by-the-following-sequence-1-1-1-2-3-5-9-18-35-75-etc-Is-there-a-mathematical-formula-to-specify-this-sequence))

⑺ [kissing number](https://plus.maths.org/content/newton-and-kissing-problem): What is the maximum kissing number that an n-dimensional sphere can have in (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space? [AlphaEvolve](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/AlphaEvolve.pdf) derived a better solution in 11 dimensions.

⑻ [Brown number](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kuAW9eDZYhs): Do there exist natural-number pairs (n, m) such that $n! + 1 = m^2$ other than (4, 5), (5, 11), and (7, 71)?

⑼ [Theory on power towers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPe9Lt8OAdM): Despite multifaceted efforts, we know very little about this function ('Euler')

⑽ Erdős’ minimum overlap problem

> ① **Problem:** Partition the set {$1,2,\ldots,2n$} into two sets $A$ and $B$ of equal size $n$. For each integer $k$, define $M_k=$＃{$(a_i,b_j): a_i\in A,\ b_j\in B,\ a_i-b_j=k$}, the number of pairs whose difference equals $k$. For a given partition $(A,B)$, consider $\max_k M_k,$ the maximum overlap over all differences. Define $M(n)=\min_{A,B}\max_k M_k.$ The constant of interest is $c=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{M(n)}{n},$ and the goal is to tighten the best known lower and upper bounds on $c$.

> ② **Recent Result:** According to a recent paper ([TTT-Discover](https://test-time-training.github.io/discover.pdf)), the current bound is $0.379005 < c < 0.380876.$

⑵ Poincaré Conjecture

⑶ Read Conjecture

> ① A combinatorics problem proposed in 1968 by British mathematician Ronald Read

> ② The conjecture that the absolute values of the coefficients of a chromatic polynomial can increase and then decrease, but cannot decrease and then increase

> ③ A chromatic polynomial is an expression that represents the number of ways to color a graph using at most n colors so that adjacent vertices are colored different colors

⑷ Rota Conjecture

> ① A problem proposed in 1971 by American mathematician Gian-Carlo Rota by generalizing the Read conjecture

> ② Expands the scope to a general setting that includes not only graphs from the Read conjecture but also the characteristic polynomials of finite sets in vector spaces
