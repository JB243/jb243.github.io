## **1\. Overview**

 ⑴ Cell Division

> ① Mitosis: Somatic Cell Division

> ② Meiosis: Germ Cell Division (Diploid → Haploid)

>> ○ Occurs in the Gonads

>> ○ Prevents doubling of genetic material in each generation

 ⑵ Gametes and Zygotes

> ① Gametes: Haploid cells (n)

> ② Zygote: Formed by fusion of two gametes, Diploid (2n)

> ③ Fertilization: Fusion of Sperm and Egg

>> ○ Sperm: Motile gamete

>> ○ Egg: Non-motile gamete

>> ○ Female: Organism producing larger gamete (egg)

>> ○ Male: Organism producing smaller gamete (sperm)

> ④ Gonads: Organs that produce gametes, i.e., testes and ovaries

> ⑤ Methods of Fertilization

>> ○ Internal Fertilization: Fertilization within reproductive tract through copulation. Mammals, birds, reptiles, sharks, etc.

>> ○ External Fertilization: Female releases eggs into the water, and males release sperm. Fish, amphibians, etc.

 ⑶ Reproduction

> ① Asexual Reproduction: Involves only mitosis, producing genetically identical offspring

>> ○ Division: Separation into two identical cells through mitosis; e.g., sea anemone.

>> ○ Budding: A portion of a somatic cell detaches and develops into a new individual; e.g., hydra.

>> ○ Regeneration: In cases of whole-body regeneration, it is considered a form of reproduction; e.g., starfish, flatworms.

>> ○ Parthenogenesis: Development of an unfertilized egg; e.g., aphids (female and male), bees (male).

> ② Sexual Reproduction: Involves meiosis, ensuring genetic diversity for evolution

>> ○ Gametogenesis → Mating → Fertilization

>> ○ Chromosomal recombination creates diverse offspring for adaptation to various environments

>> ○ Hermaphroditism and Gonochorism

>> ○ **Function 3.** Inhibits breast growth by estrogen

>> ○ **Function 4.** Initiates and maintains sperm formation through Sertoli cells

>> ○ **Function 5.** Negative feedback on LH, inhibiting GnRH release via hypothalamus and LH secretion from anterior pituitary

>> ○ **Function 6.** Induces and maintains accessory reproductive organ differentiation and function

>> ○ **Function 7.** Promotes bone growth (adolescence) and halts bone growth (late adolescence)

>> ○ **Function 8.** Sexual desire and aggressive behavior

>> ○ **Function 9.** Stimulation of erythropoietin secretion in the kidneys

> ② Women also produce small amounts in ovaries and adrenal cortex

> ③ **Type 1:** Testosterone

>> ○ Very similar to estrone and estradiol, differing mainly in methylation, double bonds, and ketone groups

>> ○ About 95% of testosterone in males is secreted by testes, 5% by adrenal cortex

> ④ **Type 2:** Androsterone

> ⑤ **Type 3:** DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone): DHT is the most representative

> ⑥ **Type 3-1:** DHT (Dehydrotestosterone)

>> ○ Testosterone is converted to DHT by 5α-reductase in peripheral tissues

>> ○ Prostate cancer and prostatic hyperplasia: Cancer cells are stimulated by DHT. Treatment involves inhibiting 5α-reductase to suppress DHT.

>> ○ Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), Adrenogenital Syndrome

>>> ○ Cholesterol is converted to sexual hormones due to 21-α-hydroxylase deficiency, enhancing DHT function

>>> ○ Corticosterone, cortisol, aldosterone deficiency results in masculinization of females

>>> ○ Cortisol and aldosterone prescription can alleviate CAH

> ⑦ Brain: Testosterone is converted to estrogen by aromatase enzyme

> ⑧ Eunuch: Removal of testes. All accessory reproductive ducts regress. Used during Chosun Dynasty

**Figure 1.** Functional Domains of Estrogen Receptor

<br>

>> ○ AF: Activation Factor

>> ○ DBD: DNA-Binding Domain

>> ○ D: [Heat Shock Proteins](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1096) Binding Domain

>> ○ F: C-Terminal Domain

> ② [Mechanism](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2052)

>> ○ Genomic pathway: Estrogen binds to ERα or ERβ and then acts on ERE or AP-1 within the target DNA to activate transcription.

>> ○ Nongenomic pathway: Estrogen + ERα/ERβ or estrogen + GPR30 activates signaling pathways, including MAPK and cAMP.

> ③ Functions: Essential steroid hormones in female reproduction.

>> ○ **Function 11.** Menopause regulation.

>> ○ **Function 12.** Slightly lowers body temperature.

> ④ Synthesis: After testosterone is produced, it is converted into estrogen by the enzyme aromatase.

>> ○ In males, testosterone is converted to estrogen in the brain, skin, liver, and adipose tissue.

>> ○ Aromatase in turtle is less active at 25°C, resulting in male birth.

>> ○ Aromatase in turtle is more active at 32°C, resulting in female birth.

> ⑤ Also produced in small amounts in males.

>> ○ Excess estrogen in males can lead to gynecomastia.

>> ○ In male aquatic animals, the testes may become feminized and produce eggs.

> ⑥ Types

>> ○ Estrone, estradiol, and estriol are included.

>> ○ Estradiol: The most potent hormone among the estrogens.

>> ○ Estrogen mainly exists in the form of 17β-estradiol, but after menopause, it is present primarily as estrone.

⑺ Luteal hormone (progesterone): A steroid hormone

> ① Production Sites: Corpus luteum (yellow body), placenta.

>> ○ During pregnancy, luteal hormone is produced in the placenta.

> ② Hypothalamic and Pituitary Feedback.

> ③ **Function 1.** GnRH Regulation

>> ○ In small amounts: Stimulates GnRH → Stimulates FSH, LH.

>> ○ In excess: **Strongly** inhibits GnRH → Inhibits FSH, LH → Prevents new follicle development.

> ④ **Function 2.** Pregnancy Preparation

>> ○ Secretion of thick mucus from the cervix: Maintains the thickened uterine lining.

>> ○ Activates MPF for oocyte cell division resumption.

>> ○ Converts uterine lining to suitable secretion tissue for embryo implantation.

>> ○ Inhibits contractions in fallopian tubes and uterine muscles.

>> ○ Inhibits proliferation of vaginal epithelial cells.

> ⑥ **Function 4.** Increases blood vessels and promotes glycogen storage.

> ⑦ Cervical mucus changes and body temperature variations: Indicators of ovulation.

 ⑻ Anti-Müllerian Hormone: Glycoprotein.

 ⑼ Inhibin: Peptide hormone.

> ① Production: Secreted by Sertoli cells in the testes of males, and by granule cells of ovarian follicles in females.

>> ○ The only peptide hormone in the ovary.

## **3. Development of the Reproductive System: Embryonic Duct**

 ⑴ Bipotential (indifferent) gonad

> ① The reproductive structures do not begin differentiation until the 7th week of development.

> ② When developmental signals are delivered, the medulla differentiates into the testes, forming the male reproductive system.

> ③ In the absence of developmental signals, the cortex differentiates into the ovaries, forming the female reproductive system.

> ④ Bipotential internal genitalia: Derived from the embryonic kidney, consisting of the Wolffian duct and the Müllerian duct.

>> ○ As development proceeds, one pair of ducts develops while the other regresses.

> ⑤ Bipotential external genitalia: Composed of the genital tubercle, urogenital folds, urethral groove, penis/clitoris, and scrotum/labia.

⑵ SRY (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome): the sex-determining locus on the male Y chromosome

> ① SRY induces differentiation of the gonadal medulla into testes and stimulates Leydig and Sertoli cells.

> ② Leydig cells: under SRY influence, secrete testosterone and its derivative DHT (dihydrotestosterone)

>> ○ Testosterone: promotes Wolffian duct differentiation and contributes to the descent of the testes from the abdomen into the scrotum

>> ○ DHT: regulates differentiation of the external genitalia and other male secondary sex characteristics

> ③ Sertoli cells: under SRY influence, secrete anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)

⑶ Male: Wolffian duct → vas (ductus) deferens, epididymis, seminal vesicles

> ① Testosterone secreted by Leydig cells actively promotes development of the Wolffian ducts.

> ② AMH secreted by Sertoli cells actively causes regression of the Müllerian ducts.

> ③ Pseudohermaphroditism

>> ○ Males inherit 5α-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT.

>> ○ In patients deficient in this enzyme, DHT is not produced, so the external genitalia appear female at birth.

>> ○ For example, the male external genitalia and prostate fail to develop adequately during fetal development.

>> ○ At puberty, renewed testicular testosterone secretion often leads to spontaneous masculinization.

> ④ Cryptorchidism

>> ○ If the testes remain in the abdominal cavity, the elevated temperature can impair spermatogenesis and cause infertility.

⑷ Female: Müllerian duct → upper vagina, oviducts/uterine (fallopian) tubes, uterus, cervix, vagina

> ① Because Leydig cells do not secrete significant testosterone, the Wolffian ducts regress.

> ② In the absence of DHT, the external genitalia develop female characteristics.

> ③ Because Sertoli cells do not secrete AMH, the Müllerian ducts develop naturally.

## **4. Male Reproductive System**

 ⑴ Reproductive organs

> ① From the Wolffian (mesonephric) duct, the epididymis and seminal vesicles are formed.

> ② Testis (testes): produces sperm and hormones; a relatively low temperature is required for normal spermatogenesis.

>> ○ Around the 7th fetal month, the testes descend from the abdominal cavity into the scrotum.

>> ○ 1–3% of newborns have incomplete descent.

>> ○ About 80% descend spontaneously with growth.

>> ○ Spermatogenesis requires a temperature 4–5 °C below core body temperature; at ≥35 °C smooth muscle relaxes.

> ③ Epididymis: stores and concentrates sperm; confers motility (i.e., sperm maturation); transports sperm by peristalsis during ejaculation.

> ④ Prostate: secretes a thin fluid containing prostaglandins, nutrients, and alkaline substances, enhancing motility.

>> ○ Prostaglandins, 60% of semen, promote sperm motility and the motility of the female reproductive tract.

>> ○ Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): causes urinary frequency and a sense of incomplete emptying; evaluated with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.

> ⑤ Seminal vesicle: secretes most components of seminal fluid.

>> ○ Produces a viscous secretion containing glucose and fructose.

>> ○ Alkaline, protecting sperm from acidic secretions in the female tract.

>> ○ Fructose provides most of the energy used by sperm.

> ⑥ Cowper’s (bulbourethral) gland: secretes a clear, mucous, alkaline pre-ejaculatory fluid → neutralizes urinary acidity and clears the urethra prior to ejaculation.

>> ○ Also secretes a small amount of lubricating mucus.

> ⑦ Urethra

>> ○ The reproductive tract (ejaculatory ducts) and urinary tract share the urethra.

>> ○ The ejaculatory duct forms when the duct from the seminal vesicle joins a duct passing through the prostate, then connects to the urethra.

>> ○ The ducts from the bulbourethral (Cowper’s) glands connect separately.

> ⑧ Glans (glans penis)

>> ○ Circumcision: removal of the prepuce. Associated with reduced risks of penile cancer, certain STIs, and cervical infections; related to the religious rite of circumcision.
 
⑵ Testis

> ① Basement membrane: prevents intrusion of foreign substances; forms part of the blood–testis barrier to regulate molecular transport.

> ② Seminiferous tubules

>> ○ Site of spermatogenesis.

>> ○ Include Sertoli cells and Leydig cells.

>> ○ Total combined length is about 250 m.

> ③ Leydig cells

>> ○ Located in the interstitial spaces between seminiferous tubules.

>> ○ Hormonal stimulation: under LH stimulation, secrete testosterone and other androgens.

>> ○ Hormone secretion: testosterone.

> ④ Sertoli cells

>> ○ Embedded in the wall of the seminiferous tubules; provide extensive support for the production and development of sperm cells.

>> ○ Hormonal stimulation: in response to testosterone and FSH, secrete paracrine factors that promote spermatogenesis.

>> ○ Hormone secretion: anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), androgen-binding protein (ABP), inhibin.

>> ○ Provide nutritional support.

>> ○ Form the blood–testis barrier, protecting sperm cells from immune attack.

>> ○ Phagocytose residual cytoplasm from developing spermatids.

⑶ Spermatozoon

> ① Haploid nucleus.

> ② Acrosome: derived from the Golgi apparatus; contains hydrolytic enzymes for penetration of the ovum; the Golgi apparatus is involved in forming the acrosome required for the acrosome reaction.

> ③ Flagellum (midpiece): contains numerous mitochondria; generates ATP.

> ④ Tail: flagellar motility; speed 1–4 mm/min.

> ⑤ Must be exposed to the chemical environment of the female reproductive tract to acquire fertilizing capacity (capacitation).

**Figure. 5.** Hormonal relationships in the male reproductive system

<br>

 ⑷ Sperm Production

> ① From puberty to adulthood, sperm production continues in the seminiferous tubules.

> ② Duration: 65 days

> ③ Daily production: 30 million

> ④ Lifetime production: 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>13</sup> sperms

> ⑤ Ejaculate: 100-300 million sperm

 ⑸ 1<sup>st</sup>. Spermatogonia generated from primitive germ cells

 ⑹ 2<sup>nd</sup>. No change from birth to puberty

 ⑺ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Endocrine changes during puberty

> ① 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. GnRH secretion ↑ → FSH and LH secretion from the anterior pituitary

> ② 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. LH → Stimulates Leydig cells → Increases testosterone secretion

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. FSH → Stimulates Sertoli cells → GPCR → Androgen binding protein (ABP) secretion ↑

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>. Testosterone + ABP → Stimulates Sertoli cell in a way of positive feedback control.

>> ○ Spermatocytes do not possess testosterone receptors, so they cannot respond to testosterone directly.

>> ○ However, spermatocytes do have receptors for androgen-binding protein (ABP), allowing them to respond to testosterone.

> ⑤ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 5<sup>th</sup>. Morphological change of Sertoli cells: Sertoli cells that were connected by tight junction undergo separation

 ⑻ 4<sup>th</sup>. As spermatogonia migrate between Sertoli cells from the cortical region of the seminiferous tubules toward the medullary region, they undergo differentiation.

> ① 4<sup>th</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Accumulation of cytoplasm in spermatogonia and DNA replication leads to the formation of **Primary Spermatocyte** (2n)

>> ○ A primary spermatocyte is a cell corresponding to prophase I of meiosis.

>> ○ Males are born with spermatogonia, whereas females are not born with oogonia.

> ② 4<sup>th</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Primary spermatocytes undergo the first meiotic division to generate 2 **Secondary Spermatocytes** (n)

>> ○ A secondary spermatocyte is a cell corresponding to metaphase II of meiosis.

> ③ 4<sup>th</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Two secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to produce 4 **Spermatids** (n)

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>. Cytoplasmic connections between spermatids are maintained until the completion of meiosis, with Sertoli cells playing a role in this process.

> ⑤ 4<sup>th</sup> \- 5<sup>th</sup>. Spermatids differentiate into sperm cells

>> ○ Most of the cellular organelles of spermatids are lost as they differentiate into sperm cells

>> ○ Exception: Golgi apparatus for acrosome reaction

> ⑥ 4<sup>th</sup> \- 6<sup>th</sup>. Mature sperm cells are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule

 ⑼ 5<sup>th</sup>. Epididymis and vas deferens

> ① Until reaching the epididymis, sperm are non-motile and are carried along by secretions from Sertoli cells.

> ② Sperm mature in the epididymis (acquiring motility), become highly concentrated, are stored until ejaculation, and are transported by peristaltic contractions.

> ③ After vasectomy (ligation of the ductus deferens), the small number of sperm present are degraded and reabsorbed by the surrounding tissues.

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Female Reproductive System**

⑴ Reproductive organs

> ① External genitalia: labia majora, labia minora, clitoris

> ② Ovary: site of oocyte maturation

>> ○ One on each side high in the pelvic cavity; roughly almond-sized

>> ○ Cortex: connective tissue layer

>> ○ Medulla: follicular cells, granulosa cells, thecal layers

>> ○ Follicular cells: produce androgens (mainly androstenedione)

>> ○ Granulosa cells: produce aromatase and convert those androgens to estrogens

> ③ Uterus: thick-walled muscular organ; site of embryo implantation

> ④ Oviduct/uterine tube (Fallopian tube): ciliated epithelium transports the fertilized ovum

>> ○ Opens into the peritoneal cavity adjacent to the ovary—the only natural passage

> ⑤ Cervix: part of the birth canal; regulates the passage of sperm

> ⑥ Vagina: birth canal; site of intercourse

> ⑦ The reproductive tract and urinary tract are completely separate.

⑵ Development of female gametes

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Oogonia generated from primordial germ cells

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Oogonia undergo mitosis during embryo stage

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. A primary oocyte is an oogonium that has entered meiosis and then arrested in prophase I (atresia state).

>> ○ A primary oocyte contains 46 chromosomes.

>> ○ A primary oocyte together with surrounding granulosa cells is collectively called a primordial follicle.

>> ○ A primary oocyte is produced by meiosis, whereas a primary spermatocyte is produced by mitosis.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Birth to puberty

>> ○ Fetus: Has around 7 million primary oocytes

>> ○ After birth: Has around 1 million primary oocytes

>> ○ Childhood: Has around 400,000 primary oocytes

>> ○ Puberty: Has around 200,000 to 400,000 primary oocytes

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. At puberty, GnRH stimulates FSH secretion from the anterior pituitary

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. FSH promotes the maturation of primary follicles; through estrogen’s negative feedback and inhibin secretion from the earliest maturing (dominant) follicle, only one or two follicles are selected.

>> ○ Primary follicle: the follicle enlarges; ribosomes, mRNA, cellular organelles, and energy reserves accumulate.

>> ○ Under FSH stimulation, the primary follicle begins to produce estrogens.

> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup>. Unequal cytoplasmic division: Stimulated primary oocyte undergoes the first meiotic division to form primary polar body and larger daughter cell

> ⑧ 8<sup>th</sup>. Secondary Oocyte: The larger daughter cell of the primary oocyte arrests in **Metaphase II** of the second meiotic division. 23 chromosomes.

>> ○ Approximately 8-9 days of the menstrual cycle

> ⑨ 9<sup>th</sup>. Secondary oocyte is released from the mature follicle through ovulation

>> ○ Secondary oocyte is around 500 μm during ovulation

>> ○ Around day 14 of the menstrual cycle

> ⑩ 10<sup>th</sup>. Activation of MPF by progesterone at ovulation

> ⑪ 11<sup>th</sup>. Sperm meets secondary oocyte in the fallopian tube and resumes the second meiotic division of the ovum

> ⑫ 12<sup>th</sup>. Through unequal cytokinesis, a second polar body and the ovum (egg cell) are produced.

>> ○ The first polar body may resume meiosis II and divide to yield two second polar bodies.

>> ○ However, the first polar body may also fail to divide.

>> ○ Polar bodies eventually degenerate.

⑶ Follicular development

> ① Follicle: a saclike cluster of cells within the ovarian endocrine tissue, composed of theca cells and granulosa cells.

**Figure. 7.** Hormonal Relationship of the Female Reproductive System

<br>

⑴ Overview

> ① The reproductive cycle occurs every 28 days, with ovulation around day 14 and menstruation around day 28.

> ② Pre-ovulation is called the follicular phase, and post-ovulation is called the luteal phase.

> ③ The reproductive cycle progresses simultaneously with the development of female gametes: the 5<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th</sup> aforementioned steps.

⑵ 1<sup>st</sup>. Maturation of Follicles

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. After the dissolution of the corpus luteum that strongly inhibits GnRH, there is a slight increase in FSH and LH secretion.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Negative feedback: Small amounts of estrogen inhibit GnRH, thereby inhibiting FSH and LH.

>> ○ Estrogen gradually increases.

> ③ 1<sup>st</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. **Early maturation** (secondary follicles): A few among numerous follicles undergo early maturation first.

>> ○ Secondary follicles possess secondary oocytes and secrete estrogen and a small amount of luteal hormone.

>> ○ Early maturation is relatively easy due to the lack of inhibitory effects from inhibin.

>> ○ Theca cells, the zona pellucida, and the follicular antrum appear.

>>> ○ Theca cells: surround the follicular (granulosa) cells.

>>> ○ Zona pellucida: surrounds the germ cell (oocyte).

> ④ 1<sup>st</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. **Late maturation**: As the follicles mature, the granulosa cell layer proliferates, and LH receptors are expressed on the layer cells.

> ⑤ 1<sup>st</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup>. **Follicle competition**: During follicle maturation, several follicles within the ovary mature, but ultimately only one or two 3rd-stage follicles mature for ovulation.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. The inhibin secreted by the first mature follicle suppresses FSH, which is involved in early maturation.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Low estrogen levels inhibit FSH and LH, preventing the maturation of other follicles.

>>> ○ Moderately mature follicles undergo atresia.

>> ○ 3rd-stage follicle (Graafian follicle) is characterized by a large antrum and is responsible for secreting estrogen.

⑶ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Development of Uterine Endometrium

> ① 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. The earliest maturing (dominant) follicle persists in producing aromatase and testosterone despite low estrogen levels.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. FSH: stimulates granulosa cells of the follicle to promote secretion of aromatase.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. LH: stimulates granulosa cells of the follicle to promote secretion of testosterone.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Testosterone is converted to estradiol (estrogen) by aromatase.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Because of the "uncooperative" earliest maturing (dominant) follicle, estrogen levels rise gradually.

>> ○ At low concentrations, estrogen exerts strong negative feedback, so the increase takes time—on the order of a full ovarian (menstrual) cycle.

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Estrogen thickens the uterine endometrium.

⑷ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Estrogen Surge

> ① 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. When estrogen levels exceed a threshold, GnRH is stimulated, promoting FSH and LH secretion.

> ② 3<sup>rd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Positive feedback: Increased FSH and LH due to estrogen further elevates estrogen concentration.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. FSH and LH dramatically increase, with FSH's increase being moderate due to inhibin.

>> ○ Inhibin selectively suppresses FSH, preventing an FSH surge comparable to that of LH.

>> ○ If FSH secretion were to rise as much as LH, the FSH that drives early maturation would initiate maturation of new follicles.

⑸ 4<sup>th</sup>. Ovulation: 14 days after menstruation

> ① 4<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. As LH responsible for late maturation (including ovulation) dramatically increases, it promotes the secretion of prostaglandins, causing follicle rupture.

> ② 4<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. When the follicle ruptures, the antral cavity (follicular antrum) releases its follicular cells.

> ③ 4<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. The follicle from which the oocyte has been released becomes the corpus luteum and secretes luteal hormones (primarily progesterone).

>> ○ Prostaglandins promote the transformation of the follicle into the corpus luteum (luteinization).

>> ○ The abrupt hormonal changes at ovulation can cause ovulatory pain (mittelschmerz) and ovulatory spotting/bleeding.

> ④ Over a lifetime, approximately 400–500 ovulations occur.

⑹ 5<sup>th</sup>. Corpus Luteum Development

> ① 5<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. After ovulation, due to the absence of follicles that would secrete estrogen, estrogen decreases.

> ② 5<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. As the corpus luteum develops, testosterone and progesterone secretion increases.

> ③ 5<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Negative feedback: Excessive progesterone inhibits GnRH, leading to FSH and LH inhibition.

>> ○ Inhibits FSH involved in early maturation, thus inhibiting maturation of new follicles and ovulation.

>> ○ A small amount of progesterone stimulates GnRH, leading to FSH and LH stimulation.

> ④ 5<sup>th</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. Testosterone and progesterone contribute to the development of the uterine endometrium.

>> ○ Estrogen: Continues to thicken the uterine endometrium.

>> ○ Progesterone: Maintains the thickness of the uterine endometrium.

⑺ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. In case the fertilized oocyte does not implant

> ① 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. The corpus luteum increases cholesterol and fats, leading to its degeneration into the corpus albicans (fibrous tissue) with a lifespan of 2 weeks.

> ② 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Menstruation: Due to the cessation of LH and progesterone secretion, the thickened uterine endometrium collapses.

>> ○ During menopause, when menstruation ceases, no primary oocytes remain.

> ③ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Returns to step ⑵.

⑻ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. In case the fertilized oocyte implants

> ① 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Fertilized egg implants in the uterus.

> ② 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Progesterone activates MPF, thereby resuming oocyte cell division.

> ③ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Implantation signals stimulate the secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

> ④ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. hCG prevents the decline of the corpus luteum, which has a lifespan of only 2 weeks.

> ⑤ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup>. The corpus luteum's function is maintained, preventing new follicle maturation and menstruation.

## **7. Fertilization**

⑴ Fertilization Process of Sea Urchin: Sea urchins are frequently used as models for fertilization.

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Attraction (chemoattraction): this step shows no species specificity.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Oocyte releases resact molecules into its surroundings.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Resact molecules react with sperm, enhancing sperm motility.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Sperm randomly moving becomes faster in the direction of the oocyte, facilitating movement towards the oocyte.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Contact

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Sperm cell contacts the jelly layer of the oocyte.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Exocytosis occurs from the acrosome of the sperm.

>> ○ Sea urchin oocyte structure: jelly layer (no receptors) – vitelline envelope (receptors present) – plasma membrane (receptors present).

>> ○ Mammalian oocyte structure: cumulus cell layer – zona pellucida – vitelline membrane – plasma membrane.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Acrosomal reaction

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Hydrolytic enzymes released from the sperm acrosome create pores in the jelly layer (involving numerous Golgi-derived vesicles).

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. A large amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and growing actin filaments form the acrosomal process.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Bindin on the acrosomal process protruding from the sperm head binds to bindin receptors on the egg's vitelline envelope.

>>> ○ Bindin-mediated binding is species-specific.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Formation of holes in the vitelline envelope → Fusion of sperm and egg cell membranes → Insertion of sperm nucleus into egg cytoplasm

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Fast block to polyspermy: sea urchins only

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions enter the zygote together with the sperm.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Depolarization of the membrane

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Anions surround the depolarized membrane.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>. Anion-enveloped membrane limits the secondary fertilization of negatively charged sperm

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. Slow block to polyspermy (cortical reaction) occurs about a minute after sperm-egg fusion

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Separation of the vitelline envelope from the plasma membrane: an absolute blockade of the zygote’s plasma membrane to additional sperm (polyspermy block).

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the zygote’s smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

>>>> ○ As with neurotransmitter release, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is always involved in vesicle exocytosis.

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave: the released Ca<sup>2+</sup> actively propagates toward vesicle-rich sites (not merely by diffusion).

>>>> ○ When two sperm are experimentally bound to a single egg, distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves occur for each.

>>>> ○ A23187: an ionophore that transports Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the phospholipid bilayer.

>>>> ○ Treatment with A23187 induces formation of the fertilization envelope without fertilization, whereas the Ca²⁺ chelator BAPTA inhibits fertilization-envelope formation.

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. The egg's cortical granules (oligosaccharide-containing vesicles) are exocytosed into the space between the plasma membrane and the vitelline envelope.

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. Because cortical granules are highly osmotic, water influx occurs.

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup>. A perivitelline space forms between the vitelline envelope and the cell membrane.

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Removal of plasma-membrane receptors: substances from the cortical granules cleave the membrane receptors that bind sperm.

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Fertilization envelope formation: enzymes from the cortical granules harden the vitelline envelope, forming the fertilization envelope.

> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup>. Cleavage

⑵ Fertilization in mammals

> ① Overview

>> ○ In mammals, fertilization of the oocyte by sperm occurs in the oviduct (Fallopian tube).

>> ○ Of roughly 300 million sperm, only about 200 reach the oocyte in the oviduct.

>> ○ Many sperm fail to survive the acidic conditions in the upper vagina.

>> ○ It takes about 30 minutes for sperm to travel from the upper vagina to the oviduct.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. The sperm penetrates the cumulus (follicular) cell layer.

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The sperm head binds to the species-specific zona pellucida glycoprotein ZP3.

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Acrosomal enzymes are released, digesting the zona pellucida and forming a tunnel.

> ⑤ 4<sup>th</sup>. The oocyte and sperm membranes fuse.

> ⑥ 5<sup>th</sup>. The sperm nucleus enters the oocyte.

> ⑦ 6<sup>th</sup>. The oocyte nucleus, having completed meiosis II, fuses with the sperm nucleus.

> ⑧ 7<sup>th</sup>. The zygote begins cleavage.

## **8. Pregnancy and Childbirth**

 ⑴ [Early Development of the Zygote](https://jb243.github.io/pages/555)

> ① Fertilization in mammals

> ② Cleavage

>> ○ Mammalian cleavage is the slowest in the animal kingdom.

>> ○ During cleavage, the embryo is transported to the uterus by the cilia of the oviduct (Fallopian tube).

>> ○ About one week after fertilization, the zygote reaches the blastocyst stage (the mammalian form of the blastula).

> ③ Embryonic gene expression

>> ○ In sea urchins, embryonic gene expression begins at the mid-blastula stage.

>> ○ In mammals, embryonic gene expression begins at the 2-cell or 4-cell stage.

> ④ Implantation

>> ○ Implantation occurs about one week after fertilization.

>> ○ A few days after the blastocyst stage, implantation occurs in the endometrium.

>> ○ The embryo implants in the uterus under the influence of progesterone.

<br>

⑵ Pregnancy

> ① Definition

>> ○ Presence of one or more embryos in the uterus.

>> ○ Dating: fertilization day → ~266 days after fertilization, or LMP → ~280 days.

>> ○ Signs: amenorrhea plus nausea/vomiting.

>> ○ Tests: detection of hCG in urine; ultrasound exam.

> ② First trimester (~12 weeks): the period of most rapid change for both mother and embryo

>> ○ Uterine enlargement compresses the bladder → frequent urination.

>> ○ Blastocyst growth: after implantation in the endometrium, the blastocyst grows and embryonic body structures begin to differentiate.

>> ○ Early development (weeks 2–4): the embryo obtains nutrients directly from the endometrium; the trophoblast expands and contributes to placental formation.

>> ○ ~4 weeks: heartbeat; ~8 weeks: limb formation begins.

>> ○ Organogenesis

>>> ○ By 8 weeks after fertilization, the major organs are formed.

>>> ○ By the end of the first trimester, most organs have begun to form.

>> ○ hCG maintains the corpus luteum until about the 4th month.

> ③ Second trimester (13–26 weeks)

>> ○ Fetal mass up to ~600 g.

>> ○ Lower abdomen enlarges; breasts enlarge; colostrum is secreted.

>> ○ Fetal movement felt at ~16 weeks; by late 2nd trimester the fetus sucks its thumb.

>> ○ hCG secretion decreases → corpus luteum regresses.

>> ○ Placenta secretes progesterone to maintain pregnancy.

>> ○ High progesterone: forms a protective cervical mucus plug; promotes growth of the maternal portion of the placenta; enlarges the uterus; suppresses the ovarian cycle.

> ④ Third trimester (27–40 weeks)

>> ○ Fetal size increases; fetal movements decrease.

>> ○ Uterine enlargement compresses abdominal organs → maternal dyspnea, indigestion, constipation, frequent urination, muscle stiffness, edema of leg joints; fetal pressure on maternal organs.

>> ○ Fetal physiology: begins digestion, stores glycogen, produces urine, and shows periodic sleep–wake cycles.

>> ○ Estrogen: stimulates prolactin secretion, but suppresses milk release before birth.

>> ○ Prolactin: promotes breast growth; strengthens the milk-producing apparatus of the mammary glands.

>> ○ Prostaglandins: secreted by the placenta; induce contraction of the uterine wall.

>> ○ Oxytocin: promotes labor by inducing uterine smooth-muscle contractions via positive feedback.

> ⑤ Maternal–fetal exchange at the placenta

>> ○ Maternal and fetal blood do not mix directly across the placenta, preventing antigen–antibody reactions and blood-type agglutination.

>> ○ Umbilical arteries: high in CO₂ and wastes.

>> ○ Mother → fetus: oxygen and nutrients.

>> ○ Fetus → mother: carbon dioxide and wastes.

>> ○ Umbilical vein: high in oxygen and nutrients.

>> ○ Amniotic fluid: prevents fetal drying and cushions external shocks.

>> ○ Countercurrent exchange increases the efficiency of transfer.

> ⑥ Morning sickness

>> ○ hCG hypothesis: morning sickness peaks around weeks 6–7, coinciding with rising hCG levels.

>> ○ Newer view: protective response against toxicity from excessive animal-protein intake; vegetarians are said not to experience morning sickness.

⑶ Childbirth: the process in which the fetus emerges from the mother, occurring 280 days after ovulation or 266 days after fertilization.

> ① Promotion of uterine contractions during labor: estrogen, oxytocin (positive feedback)

>> ○ Stage 1: cervical dilation (1 mm → 10 cm)

>> ○ Stage 2: delivery of the baby

>> ○ Stage 3: delivery of the placenta

> ② After delivery, once the placenta is expelled, estrogen and progesterone are no longer secreted.

> ③ The decrease in estrogen secretion initiates milk production.

> ④ Positive feedback: when the infant suckles after birth, prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary is stimulated.

> ⑤ Ovulation resumes as the frequency of breastfeeding decreases.

>> ○ For about two months postpartum, estrogen and progesterone levels are low, so ovulation and menstruation do not occur.

⑷ Twins

> ① Dizygotic twins: fertilization of two ova by two sperm within the same uterus.

>> ○ In a single reproductive cycle, two follicles independently develop into embryos and implant.

> ② Monozygotic twins

>> ○ Separation before implantation (within 5 days after fertilization): two chorions and two amnions.

>> ○ Separation 5–10 days after fertilization: two amniotic sacs within a single chorion.

>> ○ Separation 10–14 days after fertilization: one chorion and one amnion; rare (4–6%). Conjoined twins can only occur in this way.

>> ○ If the embryo is separated during the first month of development, monozygotic twins can result.

⑸ Contraception

> ① Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)

> ② Rhythm method (natural family planning)

>> ○ The rhythm method is the only contraceptive method recognized by the Roman Catholic Church.

>> ○ Ovulation around day 14 ± 1 of the cycle.

>> ○ Ovum survives ~2 days; sperm \~5 days.

>> ○ Fertile window: from 5 days before ovulation to 2 days after ovulation.

> ③ Basal body temperature method: predict ovulation by measuring body temperature.

> ④ Cervical mucus method: predict ovulation by the turbidity and viscosity of cervical mucus.

> ⑤ Contraceptive pills 

>> ○ Commonly used: oral contraceptives combining progestin and estrogen at a 2:1 ratio.

>> ○ <b>Effect 1:</b> Suppresses the hypothalamus, inhibiting GnRH secretion and ovulation (effectiveness 95%).

>> ○ <b>Effect 2:</b> Thickens cervical mucus and hinders sperm motility (effectiveness 95%).

>> ○ <b>Effect 3:</b> Prevents implantation of the ovum (emergency contraception) (effectiveness 80%).

>> ○ Types include combined pills, the mini-pill, and emergency (morning-after) pills.

>> ○ Side effects: menstrual cycle disturbances, fetal blood coagulation, breast cancer, uterine and ovarian cancer, ovarian cysts, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache.

> ⑥ Vaginal ring: inserted into the vagina; supplies progestin and estrogen to prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus (effectiveness 99%).

> ⑦ Cervical cap, diaphragm (pessary), sponge, female condom, male condom.

> ⑧ Spermicides: inserted into the vagina one hour before intercourse; kill sperm.

> ⑨ Intrauterine device (IUD): a plastic device inserted into the uterus; increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.

> ⑩ Female sterilization (tubal surgery): permanently occludes the fallopian tubes by tightly twisting them (effectiveness 99.5%).

> ⑪ Male sterilization (vasectomy): ligates the vas deferens to prevent sperm from being ejaculated in semen (effectiveness 99.9%).

⑹ Infertility

> ① Definition: Failure to achieve pregnancy after at least 1 year of sexual activity.

> ② <b>Cause 1.</b> Male infertility (90%)

>> ○ Low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or abnormal sperm morphology (e.g., enlarged or small head, two heads, two tails).

>> ○ In healthy individuals, about 25% of the 200–300 million sperm are morphologically abnormal.

>> ○ Abnormal sperm are eliminated in the competition to reach the fallopian tubes.

>> ○ Atrazine: a pesticide component; decreases sperm viability.

>> ○ Trichloroethylene: a degreasing/cleaning solvent; leads to production of abnormal sperm.

> ③ <b>Cause 2.</b> Female infertility

>> ○ Endometriosis: a condition in which tissue lining the uterus grows on the ovaries and fallopian tubes and responds to hormones.

>>> ○ <b>Cause 1.</b> Retrograde menstruation (main cause).

>>> ○ <b>Cause 2.</b> Possible family history.

>>> ○ <b>Cause 3.</b> Excess female hormones.

>>> ○ <b>Cause 4.</b> Menstrual cycles of 27 days or fewer, or menstruation lasting 7 days or more.

>>> ○ <b>Cause 5.</b> Early menarche.

>>> ○ <b>Cause 6.</b> Few childbirths.

>>> ○ Creates scarring in ovarian tissue and disrupts ovulation.

>>> ○ Occurs in 3–10% of women of reproductive age and in 25% of infertile women.

>> ○ Scarring from infections and sexually transmitted diseases can block tubular structures and cause infertility.

>> ○ DEHP: an endocrine disruptor and carcinogenic substance.
