## **3. Development of Reproductive System: Embryonic Ducts**

 ⑴ Potential Reproductive Glands

> ① Reproductive structures do not initiate differentiation until week 7 of development.

> ② Development signals cause mesonephros to differentiate into testis.

> ③ Absence of development signals causes paramesonephros to differentiate into ovaries.

> ④ Internal reproductive structures with potential: Wolffian duct and Müllerian duct originating from embryonic kidney.

>> ○ As development progresses, one pair of ducts develops, while the other pair regresses.

> ⑤ External reproductive structures with potential: Composed of reproductive nodes, folds, grooves, urogenital folds, scrotum.

 ⑵ _SRY_ (sex region of Y chromosome)

> ① _SRY_ induces differentiation of mesonephros into testis, stimulates Leydig cells and Sertoli cells.

> ② Leydig cells, influenced by _SRY_, secrete testosterone and its derivative DHT (dihydrotestosterone).

>> ○ Testosterone **:** Involved in Wolffian duct differentiation, descent of testes from abdomen.

>> ○ DHT **:** Involved in external genitalia differentiation and male sexual characteristics.

> ③ Sertoli cells, influenced by _SRY_, secrete Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH).

 ⑶ Male Development **:** Wolffian duct → Epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle.

> ① Testosterone secreted by Leydig cells actively stimulates Wolffian duct development.

> ② AMH secreted by Sertoli cells actively causes regression of Müllerian duct.

> ③ Pseudohermaphroditism

>> ○ Males inherit the enzyme 5α-reductase, which converts testosterone to DHT.

>> ○ Patients lacking this enzyme exhibit incomplete virilization, with female-like genitalia at birth.

>> ○ For instance, male external genitalia and prostate do not fully develop during fetal development.

>> ○ During puberty, testes start secreting testosterone, leading to natural correction.

> ④ Cryptorchidism

>> ○ If testes remain in abdominal cavity, higher temperature might lead to abnormal sperm development and infertility.

 ⑷ Female Development **:** Müllerian duct → Upper vagina, oviduct, uterus, uterine tube, fallopian tube, cervix, vagina.

> ① Lack of sufficient testosterone secretion by Leydig cells causes regression of Wolffian duct.

> ② Absence of DHT results in female external genitalia characteristics.

> ③ Lack of sufficient AMH secretion by Sertoli cells results in natural development of Müllerian duct.

**Figure. 7.** Hormonal Relationship of the Female Reproductive System

<br>

⑴ Overview

> ① The reproductive cycle occurs every 28 days, with ovulation around day 14 and menstruation around day 28.

> ② Pre-ovulation is called the follicular phase, and post-ovulation is called the luteal phase.

> ③ The reproductive cycle progresses simultaneously with the development of female reproductive cells from the 5th to the 10th day.

⑵ 1<sup>st</sup>. Maturation of Follicles

> ① 1<sup>st</sup> - After the dissolution of the corpus luteum that strongly inhibits GnRH, there is a slight increase in FSH and LH secretion.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - Negative feedback: Small amounts of estrogen inhibit GnRH, thereby inhibiting FSH and LH.

>> ○ Estrogen gradually increases.

> ③ 1<sup>st</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup> - **Early maturation** (secondary follicles): A few among numerous follicles undergo early maturation first.

>> ○ Secondary follicles possess secondary oocytes and secrete estrogen and a small amount of luteal hormone.

>> ○ Early maturation is relatively easy due to the lack of inhibitory effects from inhibin.

>> ○ Granulosa cells, zona pellucida, and theca interna appear.

>>> ○ Granulosa cells: Surround the follicular cells.

>>> ○ Zona pellucida: Surround the reproductive cells.

> ④ 1<sup>st</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup> - **Late maturation**: As the follicles mature, the granulosa cell layer proliferates, and LH receptors are expressed.

> ⑤ 1<sup>st</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup> - **Follicle competition**: During follicle maturation, several follicles within the ovary mature, but ultimately only one or two 3rd-stage follicles mature for ovulation.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - The inhibin secreted by the first mature follicle suppresses FSH, which is involved in early maturation.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - Low estrogen levels inhibit FSH and LH, preventing the maturation of other follicles.

>>> ○ Moderately mature follicles undergo atresia.

>> ○ 3rd-stage follicle (Graafian follicle): Enlarged follicular chamber. Secretes estrogen.

⑶ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Development of Uterine Endometrium

> ① 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - Despite low estrogen levels, the initial mature follicle secretes enzymes and testosterone, driving endometrial thickening.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - FSH stimulates the granulosa cells, promoting enzyme secretion.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - LH stimulates the granulosa cells, promoting testosterone secretion.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup> - Testosterone is converted to estradiol (estrogen) by aromatase.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - Despite resistance from the initial mature follicle, estrogen levels gradually increase.

>> ○ At low concentrations, estrogen suppresses, thus extending the time required for endometrial thickening.

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup> - Estrogen thickens the uterine endometrium.

⑷ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Estrogen Surge

> ① 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - When estrogen levels exceed a threshold, GnRH is stimulated, promoting FSH and LH secretion.

> ② 3<sup>rd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - Positive feedback: Increased FSH and LH due to estrogen further elevates estrogen concentration.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup> - FSH and LH dramatically increase, with FSH's increase being moderate due to inhibin.

>> ○ Inhibin selectively inhibits FSH to prevent its secretion from increasing as much as LH.

>> ○ If FSH secretion increases as much as LH, a new follicle matures due to FSH's responsibility for early maturation.

⑸ 4<sup>th</sup>. Ovulation: 14 days after menstruation

> ① 4<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - As LH responsible for late maturation (including ovulation) dramatically increases, it promotes the secretion of prostaglandins, causing follicle rupture.

> ② 4<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - Follicle rupture releases secondary oocytes.

> ③ 4<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup> - The follicle expelled with the oocyte becomes the corpus luteum, secreting luteal hormones.

>> ○ Prostaglandins facilitate the transformation of the follicle into the corpus luteum.

>> ○ Rapid hormonal changes during ovulation might lead to ovulation pain and spotting.

> ④ Around 400 to 500 ovulations occur throughout a lifetime.

⑹ 5<sup>th</sup>. Corpus Luteum Development

> ① 5<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - After ovulation, due to the absence of follicles that would secrete estrogen, estrogen decreases.

> ② 5<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - As the corpus luteum develops, testosterone and progesterone secretion increases.

> ③ 5<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup> - Negative feedback: Excessive progesterone inhibits GnRH, leading to FSH and LH inhibition.

>> ○ Inhibits FSH involved in early maturation, thus inhibiting maturation of new follicles and ovulation.

>> ○ A small amount of progesterone stimulates GnRH, leading to FSH and LH stimulation.

> ④ 5<sup>th</sup

> - 4<sup>th</sup> - Testosterone and progesterone contribute to the development of the uterine endometrium.

>> ○ Estrogen: Continues to thicken the uterine endometrium.

>> ○ Progesterone: Maintains the thickness of the uterine endometrium.

⑺ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. In case the fertilized oocyte does not implant

> ① 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. The corpus luteum increases cholesterol and fats, leading to its degeneration into the corpus albicans (fibrous tissue) with a lifespan of 2 weeks.

> ② 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Menstruation: Due to the cessation of LH and progesterone secretion, the thickened uterine endometrium collapses.

>> ○ During menopause, when menstruation ceases, no 1st-stage oocytes remain.

> ③ 6<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Returns to step ⑵.

⑻ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. In case the fertilized oocyte implants

> ① 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Fertilized egg implants in the uterus.

> ② 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Progesterone activates MPF, resuming cell division of the zygote.

> ③ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. Implantation signals the release of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a signal for corpus luteum stimulation.

> ④ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup>. hCG prevents the decline of the corpus luteum, which has a lifespan of only 2 weeks.

> ⑤ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup>. The corpus luteum's function is maintained, preventing new follicle maturation and menstruation.

## **7. Fertilization**

⑴ Fertilization Process of Sea Urchin: Sea urchins are frequently used as models for fertilization.

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. No species specificity.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Oocyte releases resact molecules into its surroundings.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Resact molecules react with sperm, enhancing sperm motility.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Sperm randomly moving becomes faster in the direction of the oocyte, facilitating movement towards the oocyte.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Contact

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Sperm cell contacts the jelly layer of the oocyte.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Exocytosis occurs from the acrosome of the sperm.

>> ○ Structure of sea urchin egg **:** Jelly layer (no receptor) - Vitelline envelope (receptor present) - Hyaline layer (receptor present)

>> ○ Structure of mammalian egg **:** Zona pellucida - Transparent layer - Vitelline envelope - Hyaline layer

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Acrosomal reaction

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Enzymes released from the acrosome of the sperm create holes in the jelly layer (involves numerous cortical granules).

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Massive Ca2+ release from cortical granules leads to the formation of the acrosomal process in growing actin filaments.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Binding occurs between the exposed protein on the acrosomal process of the sperm head and the exposed receptor on the vitelline envelope.

>>> ○ Binding is specific to the species.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Formation of holes in the vitelline envelope → Fusion of sperm and egg cell membranes → Insertion of sperm nucleus into egg cytoplasm

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Fast block to polyspermy in sea urchins only

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Na+ and Ca2+ influx with sperm

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Depolarization of the membrane

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Membrane surrounding with anions

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>. Anion-enveloped membrane limits the secondary fertilization of negatively charged sperm

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. Slow block to polyspermy (cortical reaction) occurs about a minute after sperm-egg fusion

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Separation of the vitelline envelope and hyaline layer **:** Second polar body formation of the egg and origin of the vitelline envelope blockage

>>> ○ Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the egg's cortical granules

>>>> ○ Like a neurotransmitter, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in cortical granule exocytosis

>>> ○ Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave **:** Released Ca<sup>2+</sup> actively moves to where the cortical granules are (non-diffusion)

>>>> ○ Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves occur separately when two sperm artificially fuse with one egg

>>>> ○ A23187 **:** Compound that transports Ca2+ across lipid bilayers

>>>> ○ A23187 leads to membrane formation without fusion, while Ca2+-binding chelators (BAPTA) inhibit membrane formation

>>> ○ Release of the oligosaccharide cortical granule, that is, the cortical granule and lipid droplets, into the gap between the vitelline envelope and hyaline layer

>>> ○ Cortical granule swells with high osmotic pressure, causing water influx

>>> ○ Formation of the fertilization envelope between the vitelline envelope and cell membrane

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Removal of hyaline layer receptors **:** Cutting of membrane receptors by substances in the cortical granule

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Formation of the membrane **:** Cortical granule enzymes harden the vitelline envelope, forming a membrane

> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup>. Completion of fertilization

 ⑵ Mammalian Fertilization

> ① Overview

>> ○ Mammalian fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube.

>> ○ Only about 200 out of 300 million sperm reach the oocyte in the fallopian tube.

>> ○ Many sperm do not survive the acidic conditions of the female genital tract.

>> ○ It takes about 30 minutes for a sperm to travel from the female genital tract to the fallopian tube.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Penetration of the sperm into the zona pellucida

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Sperm head binds to the species-specific protein (ZP3) on the zona pellucida.

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Acrosomal enzymes are released, breaking down the zona pellucida and creating a tunnel.

> ⑤ 4<sup>th</sup>. Fusion of egg and sperm membranes

> ⑥ 5<sup>th</sup>. Sperm nucleus enters the egg cell

> ⑦ 6<sup>th</sup>. Completion of the second meiotic division in the egg, followed by fusion with the sperm nucleus

> ⑧ 7<sup>th</sup>. Initiation of the zygote

> ① Mammalian Fertilization

> ② Zygote

>> ○ Mammalian zygote formation is the slowest among the animal kingdom.

>> ○ An embryo undergoing zygote formation moves into the uterus through the fallopian tube.

>> ○ The zygote is referred to as a blastocyst about a week after fertilization.

> ③ Expression of Embryonic Genes

>> ○ In the case of sea urchins, expression of embryonic genes occurs during mid-blastula transition.

>> ○ In mammals,

 embryonic gene expression occurs during the 2-cell or 4-cell stage.

> ④ Implantation

>> ○ Implantation occurs about one week after fertilization.

>> ○ Implantation into the endometrium occurs a few days after the blastocyst stage.

>> ○ Embryo implants into the uterus due to the action of progesterone.

>> ○ **Stage 2:** Delivery of the baby

>> ○ **Stage 3:** Delivery of the placenta

> ② After Birth, Estrogen and Progesterone are no longer secreted as the placenta is removed.

> ③ Decreased Estrogen Secretion Initiates Milk Production.

> ④ Positive Feedback **:** After birth, when the baby starts breastfeeding, the pituitary gland releases prolactin

> ⑤ When breastfeeding frequency decreases, ovulation resumes

>> ○ **During the first 2 months after birth**, low levels of estrogen and progesterone prevent ovulation and menstruation

⑷ Twins

> ① **Dizygotic Twins (Fraterna Twins):** Develop from two separate eggs and two separate sperm cells within the same uterus

>> ○ If two eggs are independently fertilized during one reproductive cycle.
