## **2. Genetic Identity**

⑴ Evidence for genetic equivalence

> ① Totipotency in plants

> ② Nuclear transplantation in animals

>> ○ Briggs & King's experiment: concluded that as development proceeds substantially, nuclear activity changes.

>> ○ Gurdon's experiment: showed that nuclei from differentiated cells can still induce development.

> ③ Reproductive cloning in mammals

> ④ Differentiation capacity of stem cells

>> ○ Stem cell: a cell with the capacity to differentiate into specific cell type(s).

>> ○ Unipotency: the ability to differentiate into only one cell type.

>> ○ Multipotency: the ability to differentiate into several cell types.

>> ○ Pluripotency: the ability to differentiate into all cell types.

>> ○ Totipotency: the ability to develop into a complete organism; also called "organism-forming potential."

>>> ○ In other words, totipotency refers to the capacity to form the embryo, all adult tissues, and— in species that have them— the extraembryonic membranes.

 ⑵ Types of Stem Cells

> ① **Type 1:** Embryonic Cells

>> ○ Definition: the fertilized egg itself

>> ○ Consists of trophoblast cells + inner cell mass; totipotent

> ② **Type 2:** Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)

>> ○ Definition: Cells obtained during the differentiation of embryonic cells.

>> ○ Advantage: Pluripotency.

>> ○ Disadvantage: Ethical issues (even though ESCs are considered only up to the blastocyst stage, ethical concerns remain).

>> ○ Types: Fertilized-embryo–derived ESC, blastomere-derived ESC, parthenogenetic ESC, somatic cell nuclear transfer–derived ESC (SCNT-ESC).

>> ○ Fertilized-embryo–derived ESC: Obtained by isolating the inner cell mass from an embryo.

>> ○ Parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells: Oocytes undergo cleavage without sperm (parthenogenesis).

>> ○ History

>>> ○ 1981: First established from mouse blastocysts.

>>> ○ 1998: Thomson et al. first established human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).

> ③ **Type 3:** Adult Stem Cells (ASC)

>> ○ Definition: Stem cells found in adults

>> ○ **Advantages:** No ethical concerns

>> ○ **Disadvantages:** **Multipotency**, **Unipotency**

>> ○ Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC)

>>> ○ Differentiates into white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, etc.

>>> ○ Associated with malignant blood disorders, severe aplastic anemia, etc.

>>> ○ CD34+

>> ○ Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC)

>>> ○ Obtained from connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels, and fat, which are differentiated from the mesoderm.

> ⑤ **Type 5:** Terminally Differentiated Cells

⑶ Determination: The time point at which the expression of specific genes drives cell differentiation (e.g., expression of MyoD1).

> ① Autonomous specification: Fate is fixed from the outset (e.g., mollusks, urochordata).

>> ○ Example: Cytoplasmic determinants present in the egg become unevenly distributed after cleavage.

> ② Conditional specification: Fate is determined during development by influences from neighboring cells.

>> ○ Differentiation can be induced by signaling molecules from surrounding cells.

## **3. Developmental Process**

⑴ Overview

> ① Stage 1: Cell division

> ② Stage 2: Cell differentiation

> ③ Stage 3: Morphogenesis

> ③ Stage 4: Pattern formation

⑵ Oocyte activation

> ① Early oocyte activation: before fertilization

>> ○ Because NADPH is used during biomembrane formation, NAD<sup>+</sup> becomes activated/increased.

>> ○ MAPK inactivation → transient arrest of cell division → preparation for full cleavage; initiation of DNA replication.

> ② Late oocyte activation: after fertilization

>> ○ There is not enough time for de novo transcription → mRNAs are supplied to the cytoplasm → proteins needed for cleavage are produced → transcriptional repressors have no immediate effect.

>> ○ Direct transcription begins only after the gastrula stage; therefore, transcriptional repressors become effective then.

>> ○ Protein synthesis proceeds better at higher pH; the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger raises cytoplasmic pH.

⑶ Cleavage

> ① Features

>> ○ G1 and G2 phases are absent; only S and M phases occur.

>> ○ As cleavage proceeds, the cytoplasm-to-nucleus volume ratio gradually decreases.

>> ○ Among maternal-effect factors: a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin

> ② Classification by yolk

>> ○ Yolk: nutrients required for development.

>> ○ **Type 1.** Holoblastic cleavage: cleavage occurs throughout the entire egg.

>>> ○ Equal (isolecithal): occurs in eggs with little yolk evenly distributed (e.g., echinoderms—sea urchins—and mammals).

>>> ○ Unequal (mesolecithal): occurs in eggs with a moderate amount of yolk concentrated toward the vegetal pole (e.g., amphibians).

>> ○ **Type 2.** Meroblastic cleavage: cleavage occurs only in specific regions.

>>> ○ Discoidal cleavage: in telolecithal eggs where abundant yolk occupies most of the egg (e.g., birds, reptiles, fish).

>>> ○ Superficial cleavage: in centrolecithal eggs where abundant yolk is centered (e.g., insects, Drosophila).

> ③ Classification by orientation

>> ○ Radial cleavage: echinoderms (e.g., sea urchin), lancelets (amphioxus).

>> ○ Spiral cleavage: annelids, mollusks, platyhelminths (flatworms).

>> ○ Bilateral cleavage: cephalopods, amphibians.

>>> ○ Meridional cleavage: the animal–vegetal axis is vertical, and the cleavage plane is meridional (parallel to that axis); accordingly, the mitotic spindle is oriented horizontally.

>>> ○ Equatorial cleavage: the animal–vegetal axis is vertical, and the cytokinetic cleavage plane is horizontal (equatorial).

>> ○ Rotational cleavage: mammals, nematodes.

> ④ Animal and vegetal poles

>> ○ Animal pole: less yolk → cleavage proceeds readily; blastomeres are small.

>> ○ Vegetal pole: more yolk → cleavage is impeded; blastomeres are large.

⑷ Blastula stage

> ① A blastocoel is present during the blastula stage.

> ② The blastocoel soon regresses and disappears.

⑸ Gastrulation: axis formation

> ① Gastrulation: invagination

>> ○ Morphogen: a substance that diffuses to form a concentration gradient and specifies different cell fates according to the degree of exposure to that gradient.

> ② Organizers

>> ○ Nieuwkoop center: induces the organizer.

>> ○ Dorsal lip of the blastopore (Spemann organizer): amphibians.

>> ○ Notochord: organizer/inducer of the neural tube.

>> ○ Micromeres: form the archenteron; later give rise to skeletogenic spicules; observed in sea urchins.

>> ○ Hensen's node.

>> ○ Limb bud.

> ③ Mechanisms of gastrulation

>> ○ Large-scale cell movements.

>> ○ The blastocoel regresses and disappears; the archenteron takes its place.

>> ○ Formation of the germ layers.

**Figure. 1.** Formation of the Germ Layers

<br>

> ① Ectoderm: epidermis, nervous system, brain, pigment cells, lens of the eye, adrenal medulla.

> ② Mesoderm: muscles, renal tubules (nephrons), notochord, heart, connective tissue, kidney, circulatory system, bones and skeletal muscle, adrenal cortex, dermis.

> ③ Endoderm: respiratory system, digestive system, endocrine glands, urinary bladder.

>> ○ Note: digestive organs such as the liver, lung, and intestine are endoderm-derived; the kidney alone is mesoderm-derived.

> ④ Germ cells: sperm and egg; not part of any germ layer.
