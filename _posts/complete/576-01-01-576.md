## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Stimulus

> ① Definition: Changes in the surrounding environment

> ② Characteristics: Modality, intensity, location, timing

⑵ Sensation: Subjective experience triggered when sensory receptors are activated by a stimulus

> ① Mechanism: Sensory transformation → Amplification → Transmission → Integration → Consciousness

>> ○ Sensory receptors: Generate action potential when physical stimulus exceeds the threshold

>> ○ Sensory transduction: Conversion of light, chemical, mechanical, thermal energy to electrical energy directly or through GPCR mediation

> ② Sensory Encoding: Mechanisms to distinguish stimuli

>> ○ Modality of stimulus: Labeled-line sensory channel by specific sensory receptors

>>> ○ Law of specific nerve energy: Nature of sensation is determined by the type of sensory receptor, not the type of stimulus

>> ○ Intensity of stimulus: Magnitude of sensory receptor voltage, frequency of action potential, repetition

>> ○ Location of stimulus: Topographical organization

>>> ○ Examples: Somatosensory homunculus, Retinotopic map, Tonotopic map

> ③ Types of Sensory Receptors

>> ○ Types of sensory receptors based on stimuli

>>> ○ Electromagnetic receptors

>>> ○ Chemical receptors

>>> ○ Mechanical receptors

>>> ○ Nociceptors

>>> ○ Thermoreceptors

>> ○ Types of sensory receptors based on structure

>>> ○ Simple receptors: Neurons with free nerve endings

>>> ○ Complex neural receptors: Nerve endings encased in connective tissue sheath

>>> ○ Specialized sensory receptors: Release neurotransmitters to initiate action potentials in sensory neurons

>> ○ Types of sensory receptors based on principles

>>> ○ Tonic receptors: Slowly adapting receptors

>>>> ○ Maintain depolarization even during sustained stimulus

>>>> ○ Convey stimulus **magnitude** (e.g., proprioceptors, nocioceptors)

>>> ○ Phasic receptors: Rapidly adapting receptors

>>>> ○ Cease firing if stimulus intensity remains constant (e.g., olfactory receptors, touch receptors)

>>>> ○ Detect onset, offset, and **changes** of stimulus primarily

> ④ When Neurons are Sensory Cells

>> ○ Olfactory receptors

>> ○ Cutaneous receptors

>> ○ Pacinian receptors

>> ○ Thermoreceptors

>> ○ Stretch receptor (e.g., muscle spindle [cerebellum, unconscious sensation])

⑵ Characteristics of the Sensory System

> ① **Decussation** (chiasm): Sensory and motor tracts in the brain cross over, governing opposite side (contralateral) regions of the body

>> ○ Reasons remain unclear

> ② Synaptic Integration: Sensory information interaction due to connection structure

>> ○ Convergence

>> ○ Divergence

>> ○ Facilitation

>> ○ Occlusion

> ③ Lateral Inhibition: Sensory receptor excitation inhibits nearby receptor activity

>> ○ Two-point discrimination: Ability to distinguish two adjacent stimuli

>>> ○ Example: Recognizing spikes in food

<br>

> ④ Adaptation: Gradual decrease in sensory receptor voltage due to sustained stimulus

>> ○ SA (slowly adapting receptor)

>> ○ RA (rapidly adapting receptor)

>> ○ TA (transiently adapting receptor)

> ⑤ Parallel Processing

> ⑥ Descending Control: Sensory information feedback regulation downwards as well

>> ○ Example: Temporarily forgetting pain through other senses

> ⑦ Except for olfactory information, all sensory information passes through the thalamus

> ⑧ Plasticity

>> ○ Advantage: Increased efficiency in brain's information processing

>> ○ Disadvantage: May lead to conditions like hallucinogenic pain

⑷ Psychophysics

> ① Principles: Physical reality ≠ Psychological reality, active, evolutionary

> ② Psychophysical Measurement Functions

>> ○ Different reactions from different individuals

>> ○ Measuring reactions when stimulus is suddenly introduced in absence of prior stimuli

>> ○ Concepts: Detection rate, theoretical threshold curve, threshold-below stimulus, absolute threshold, obtained threshold curve

> ③ Just Noticeable Difference (JND)

>> ○ Weber's Law: ΔI/Ii = constant

>>> ○ Light: ΔIlight / Ii, light × 100 = 8 (%)

>>> ○ Weight: ΔIweight / Ii, weight = 2 (%)

>>> ○ Sound: ΔIsound / Ii, sound = 0.3 (%)

> ④ Signal Detection Theory (SDT)

>> ○ Detecting faint signals in noise

>> ○ Assumption: No single absolute threshold

>> ○ Concepts: Liberal criterion, conservative criterion, noise, signal

> ⑤ Psychophysical Adaptation

⑸ McGurk Effect

> ① Definition: Integrating different sensory information to perceive when perceiving sensory information

> ② Example: Seeing 'ga' but hearing 'ba' results in perception as 'da'

⑻ Chemical Receptors

> ① Chemical Sensation

>> ○ Oldest and most widespread sensory organs

>> ○ Detect chemical signals in our internal and external environment

>> ○ All species and cells detect various chemicals

> ② Olfactory Receptors in Vertebrates: Nose

> ③ Gustatory Receptors in Vertebrates: Tongue

> ④ Moth's Chemical Receptors: Antennae

>> ○ In adult males, the receptors can respond even to a single molecule of bombykol secreted by the female.

>> ○ Bombykol → male antenna → sensillum (sensory hair) → olfactory receptor → dissolves in fluid → acts on the receptor membrane → dissolution.

⑼ Electromagnetic Receptors

> ① Lorenzini Organs: Found in sharks, salamanders, and can sense electrical signals

⑽ Interoception

> ① Example: Knowing the position of your arm even with closed eyes

⑾ Thermal Receptors

> ① Example: Snakes have pit organs, thermal sensors
