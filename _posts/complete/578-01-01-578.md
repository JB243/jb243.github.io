## **1.** **Plant Kingdom**

 ⑴ Characteristics: Traits shared by all terrestrial plants

> ① Photoautotrophic Nutrition: Chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids

> ② Multicellular eukaryotic cells with differentiated tissues

> ③ Main component of cell walls is cellulose

>> ○ Rosette-type cellulose synthesizing enzymes: Shared only by algae and terrestrial plants

> ④ Non-motile

> ⑤ Adaptation to terrestrial life

>> ○ Terrestrial environment is dry: Waxy cuticle layer with high waterproofing ability developed on the surface

>> ○ Developed from differentiation of roots, stems, and leaves

>> ○ Vascular bundles like xylem and phloem are developed (Exception: Bryophyta)

> ⑥ Alternation of generations

> ⑦ Dependent on external fertilization

> ⑧ Sporangia produce spores with walls

> ⑨ Multicellular gametangia

> ⑩ Meristematic tissue

 ⑵ Evolution

> ① Existed on land for over 400 million years

>> ○ First terrestrial plants: Small, lacking vascular tissues

>> ○ Evolution of vascular tissues led to the emergence of large trees, enabling growth in dry areas

>> ○ Seeds: Adaptation to dry terrestrial environments

> ② Evolution of flowers: Most modern plants are flowering plants that appeared around 140 million years ago.

>> ○ Diversification of angiosperms led to double fertilization and 150 families, over 90% of modern plants through adaptive radiation.

>> ○ Double fertilization: Pollen tube delivers two sperm cells, one fertilizes the egg cell to become the zygote (2n), the other fuses with two polar nuclei to form the endosperm (3n)

> ③ No nutrient provisioning until the egg cell is fertilized

> ④ Assisted by animals, wind, water, etc., for fertilization

 ⑶ Comparison between Algae and Plants

> ① Habitat: Algae inhabit water, plants inhabit land

> ② Roots: Algae have rhizoids, plants have roots

> ③ Stems: Algae supported by water buoyancy, plants supported by stems

> ④ Leaves: Algae photosynthesize throughout the body, plants mainly in leaves

## **2. Common Structure of Plants**

 ⑴ Levels of plant organization

Cells → Tissues → Tissue systems → Organs → Organisms

 ⑵ Cellulose Synthesis

> ① H+-ATPase and cellulose synthase are present in plant cell membranes

> ② Orientation of microtubules attached to the inner cell membrane determines the direction of cellulose fiber formation outside the cell membrane

> ③ Cellulose microfibrils align perpendicular to the direction of cell expansion (longitudinal axis)

 ⑶ Growth stages

> ① Primary growth: Young plant parts develop leaves, stem and root lengths increase

>> ○ Primary cell wall: Young plant cells have thin and easily deformable primary cell walls

>> ○ Middle lamella: Composed of pectin, connecting adjacent primary cell walls

> ② Secondary growth: Stems and roots thicken in older regions

>> ○ Secondary cell wall: Composed of primary cell wall, lignin, suberin

>> ○ Not applicable to sclerenchyma fiber cells, xylem water-conducting cells, and phloem sieve tubes.

>> ○ Lignin: Deposited in secondary cell wall, making it rigid.

> ③ Secondary growth in trees

>> ○ Heartwood: The inner layers of the secondary xylem. They no longer function in water conduction, and the tree can survive without this part. It typically appears dark-colored due to the presence of resins or other compounds that help prevent the invasion of fungi and insects.

>> ○ Sapwood: The outermost layers of the secondary xylem, which are the most recently formed. These layers are actively involved in water conduction.

<br>

<br>

## **3. Plant Structure: Leaves**

 ⑴ Three primary tissues: Epidermis, ground tissue, vascular tissue

 ⑵ Epidermal tissue: Equivalent to animal epithelial tissue

> ① Cuticle layer: Wax layer (cutin), prevents water loss, prevents microbial invasion

> ② Epidermal cells

>> ○ Guard cells are a type of epidermal cells

>> ○ Except for guard cells, epidermal cells have no chloroplasts.

> ③ Companion cells: Related to stomata 

>> ○ The higher the K+ and Cl- content inside guard cells, and the higher the turgor pressure of guard cells, the larger the size of stomata.

>> ○ Among the epidermal cells of chloroplasts, only guard cells have chloroplasts.

 ⑶ Ground Tissue: Refers to mesophyll tissue responsible for photosynthesis

> ① Mesophyll tissue: Tissue composed of specialized parenchyma cells for photosynthesis, divided into palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll

> ② Palisade mesophyll tissue: Tissue with densely packed mesophyll cells

> ③ Spongy mesophyll tissue: Tissue with loosely arranged mesophyll cells

>> ○ Example: Vascular bundle sheath cells: Surround the vascular bundle

> ④ More developed in shade plants.

 ⑷ Vascular Bundle Tissue: Refers to the vascular bundle of leaves

> ① Surrounded by vascular bundle sheath cells.

> ② Upper side is the xylem and lower side is the phloem

> ③ Dicots have a reticulate venation, while monocots have parallel venation

 ⑵ Epidermis Tissue: Epidermis

 ⑶ Ground Tissue

> ① Cortex

> ② Pith: Mainly composed of parenchyma cells

 ⑷ Vascular Bundle Tissue

> ① Xylem

>> ○ Composed of dead cells

>> ○ Adjacent to the pith

>> ○ Pit: The part of a cell that possesses only a primary cell wall, despite the presence of a secondary cell wall in other regions of the same cell.

> ② Phloem: Adjacent to the cortex
 
>> ○ Phloem in angiosperms: Composed of sieve elements, companion cells, sieve plates, and sieve pores.

>> ○ Sieve elements: Living cells, but they lack organelles such as a nucleus, ribosomes, and vacuoles.

>>> ○ Facilitates the smooth flow of phloem sap.

>> ○ Companion cells: Connected to sieve elements via plasmodesmata; responsible for the functions of the nucleus and most organelles on behalf of the sieve elements.

>> ○ Sieve plates are located at the ends of the sieve elements.

> ③ Monocots have a bundle sheath surrounding the veins, while dicots have scattered bundle sheaths

> ④ In each vascular bundle, the phloem is located more externally than the xylem

⑸ Meristematic Tissue

> ① Apical meristem

<br>

<br>

## **5. Plant Structure: Root**

 ⑴ Three Tissues: Epidermis, Ground Tissue, Vascular Bundle Tissue

 ⑵ Epidermis Tissue

> ① Root hairs: Absorb water and minerals, exchange cations 

 ⑶ Ground Tissue: Cortex

> ① Root cap

>> ○ Observed in leguminous plants

>> ○ Rhizobium: An aerobic bacterium; its nitrogen-fixing enzyme is sensitive to oxygen.

>> ○ Symbiosis: Plants provide nutrients to Rhizobium, which supplies nitrogen compounds to plants

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Substances secreted by Rhizobium induce root hair curling

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Rhizobium secretes enzymes to degrade cell walls

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Rhizobium penetrates into the root hair

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. A vesicle containing Rhizobium migrates through the cortical and endodermal cells and then differentiates into a bacteroid.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Infected cortex and endodermal cells continue to grow, forming root nodule 

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Decreased oxygen concentration occurs

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. The formation of a lignin-rich sclerenchyma cell layer limits the diffusion of oxygen.

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Leghemoglobin (iron-containing) binds oxygen, leading to oxygen depletion

>> ○ 7<sup>th</sup>. Bacteroids in the root nodule fix nitrogen using its nitrogen-fixing enzyme.

>> ○ 8<sup>th</sup>. Nitrogen fixation: N<sub>2</sub> → NH<sub>3</sub> → NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, requires 16 ATP

> ② Pericycle: The tissue from which lateral roots originate.

>> ○ Generates lateral meristematic tissue to thicken the root

>> ○ Transports nutrients and ions to the vascular bundle cells

> ③ Endodermis: The innermost cell layer of the cortex.

>> ○ Unlike other cortex cells, it has suberin in the cell walls, restricting water movement

 ⑷ Vascular Bundle Tissue

> ① Stele: Composed of the pericycle, xylem, and phloem

> ② Xylem vascular bundle

>> ○ Dicotyledons: The xylem is arranged in a cross shape, and the phloem is located between the arms of the xylem.

>> ○ Monocotyledons: The xylem forms multiple ring-shaped cylinders surrounding the pith, with the phloem located between the xylem bundles.

>> ○ Pits are observed.

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Plant Physiology**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Material Transport Pathways

>> ○ Apoplast Pathway: Pathway along the apoplast

>>> ○ Apoplast: The cell wall located outside the plasma membrane, the extracellular space, and the interior of dead cells such as tracheids and xylems.

>>> ○ Due to the need to cross the endodermal cell membrane through secondary active transport that relies on the H⁺ gradient, energy is required.

>> ○ Symplast Pathway: Pathway through the symplast

>>> ○ Symplast: A continuous cytoplasmic network connecting all living cells in a plant through plasmodesmata.

>>> ○ Material transport without the use of energy

>>> ○ Example: The internal space of phloem sieve elements, and plasmodesmata.

>> ○ Transmembrane Pathway

> ② Water Potential

>> ○ It is important when explaining the mechanism of water transport from roots to leaves.

>> ○ Water moves from areas of high water potential to areas of low water potential.

>> ○ Important for explaining the mechanism of water movement from roots to leaves

>> ○ Water potential = Solute potential + Pressure potential

>>> ○ Solute potential: π = -CRT (C: Molar concentration), related to osmotic pressure

>>> ○ Pressure potential: Turgor pressure, pressure exerted by cell walls on cells

>> ○ Gradient of water potential: Soil > Root epidermis > Root cortex > Root stele > Stem > Leaf > Atmosphere

>> ○ Primary driving force: **Cohesion-Tension Theory**

>>> ○ Cohesion-Tension Theory: Transpiration at leaves leads to water molecules with strong cohesion being pulled upward due to evaporation

>> ○ Secondary driving force: **Root Pressure**

> ③ Phloem Loading and Transport

>> ○ Source of sugar: Tissues where photosynthesis and starch breakdown lead to net production of sugars (e.g., leaves)

>>> ○ At the source region, the phloem has a lower osmotic pressure compared to the xylem.

>> ○ Sink of sugar: Tissues that consume or store sugars, such as division tissues (sugar consumption), roots (sugar storage and consumption), and fruits (sugar storage).

>> ○ Sugars are stored in the form of starch, but transported in the form of sucrose.

>>> ○ Reason: Sucroses are non-reducing sugars

>>> ○ Types of sugar transporters: Monosaccharide (MST), sucrose (SUT), hexose (SWEET)

>> ○ Pressure Flow Model: Water is pushed into the phloem sieve tube elements of source tissues and then sap moves to sink tissues due to pressure differences

>>> ○ Bulk flow: Movement of solution driven by pressure potential

>>> ○ Sink tissues have higher osmotic pressure, so sap is drawn in

>>> ○ Source tissues have lower osmotic pressure to allow sap to be expelled

>>> ○ Sugar concentration is higher in source tissues

>> ○ Sucrose can also be delivered to leaves on the opposite side of the source through phloem cross-transport.

 ⑵ Root Material Transport

> ① Casparian Strip

>> ○ Impermeable layer made of wax called suberin.

>> ○ To enter the stele of the root, water must pass through the symplast of the endodermis.

>>> ○ Prevents unnecessary or toxic substances from entering

>>> ○ Prevents leakage of substances stored in the xylem into the soil

> ② Cation Exchange: Root hairs actively transport H<sup>+</sup> into the soil, allowing absorption of mineral cations

>> ○ Electric gradient leads to separation of mineral cations from soil particles, facilitating absorption

>> ○ H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is used during active transport of H<sup>+</sup>.

>> ○ H<sup>+</sup> co-transporter is used during mineral cation absorption into root.

>> ○ H<sup>+</sup> re-enters the cell along its concentration gradient, leading to increased cell membrane potential, compensated by anion uptake

> ③ Nitrate Transporter

>> ○ High Affinity Transporter (HAT): Functions regardless of nitrate concentration

>> ○ Low Affinity Transporter (LAT): Leads to rapid membrane depolarization (nitrate uptake) if nitrate concentration is high

>> ○ Cycloheximide: Inhibitor of low affinity transporters

 ⑶ Stem Material Transport

> ① Movement of sap occurs due to bulk flow

> ② Main component of sap: Sugars

 ⑷ Leaf Material Transport

> ① Stoma (stomate, pore)

>> ○ Gap between two specialized epidermal cells (guard cells)

>> ○ Pathway for water and carbon dioxide

> ② Stomatal Opening and Closure

>> ○ Cellulose microfibers radiate from guard cell walls

>> ○ Increase in guard cell turgor pressure leads to guard cells expanding radially → stomatal opening

> ③ Mechanism of Stomatal Opening

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Blue Light Signal

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Blue light → Blue light receptor (Zeaxanthin)

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Signal transmission by the blue light receptor

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Proton pumps in guard cells export H+ outside the cell through the plasma membrane

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>. H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> enter the cell through cotransport along the concentration gradient of H<sup>+</sup>

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 5<sup>th</sup>. Cl<sup>-</sup> enters the cell to balance charge

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 6<sup>th</sup>. Increase in osmotic concentration in guard cells

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 7<sup>th</sup>. Increase in water entry into guard cells

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 8<sup>th</sup>. Increase in guard cell turgor pressure

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 9<sup>th</sup>. Guard cells swell, leading to stomatal opening

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Red Light Signal

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Increased photosynthesis rate leads to increased sucrose production and osmotic concentration → 1<sup>st</sup> \- 6<sup>th</sup>

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Decreased CO<sub>2</sub> pressure leads to K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> uptake → 1<sup>st</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>

>>> ○ Every CO<sub>2</sub> molecule results in the evaporation of 40 water molecules

>> ○ Blue light response is faster than red light response

> ④ Mechanism of Stomatal Closure

>> ○ Evening: Decrease in blue light, decrease in sugar → reverse mechanism of stomatal opening → water loss from guard cells  → stomatal closure

>> ○ Water stress

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Increased ABA: Cells with chloroplasts produce ABA, mainly transported by phloem. Increases with pH.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Without water stress: ABA-H+ form → uptake by mesophyll cells → reduced accessibility to guard cells → maintained stomatal opening

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. ABA<sup>-</sup> reaches guard cells → signal transduction pathway

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, and water are expelled from guard cells

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Stomatal closure

 ⑵ Auxin (Indole-3-Acetic Acid, IAA)

> ① Formation of auxin by transformation of tryptophan

> ② Mechanism of action: Auxin → Binding to ABP 1 → Gene transcription promotion → Increased physiological activity

> ③ Effects

>> ○ Stem elongation: Promotion of stem elongation at low concentrations, inhibition at high concentrations

>> ○ Promotion of lateral root formation

>> ○ Delayed leaf abscission

>> ○ Apical dominance: Inhibition of lateral bud growth

>> ○ Synthetic auxin: Selective removal of dicot weeds embedded among monocot crops or grasses

>> ○ Fruit development regulation: Fruit growth after pollination is controlled by auxin, inducing unit fruit formation.

> ④ Polar Transport

>> ○ Auxin moves only from the stem apex to the base

>> ○ Movement towards the root, not gravity-related

> ⑤ Redistribution Hypothesis

>> ○ Auxin moves from the side illuminated by light to the shaded side

>> ○ Asymmetric elongation induced on the shaded side, causing bending towards the light

> ⑥ Acid Growth Hypothesis

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Auxin increases H+ pump activity

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Decreases cell wall pH

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Activation of expansin proteins due to low pH

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Expansins cleave cross-linking glycans, loosening the cell wall

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Cell expansion due to turgor pressure

> ⑦ Characteristics

**Figure. 2.** Increase in root and stem length according to auxin concentration 

<br>

>> ○ Polar transport (inside the cell): Passive diffusion or secondary active transport

>> ○ Polar transport (outside the cell): Passive proteins located only below. Requires ionization within cells for transport protein.

 ⑶ Cytokinin

> ① Composed of zeatin, isopentenyl adenine, kinetin, etc.

> ② Synthesized in root apex meristem, transported upward through the xylem

> ③ Pyrimidine derivatives

> ④ Effects

>> ○ Regulation of cell division and differentiation

>>> ○ Auxin and cytokinin act antagonistically

>>> ○ High cytokinin levels in callus → Shoots

>>> ○ High auxin levels in callus → Roots

>> ○ Axillary bud growth promotion: Apical dominance

>> ○ Delay of leaf senescence (prevents abscission): Inhibits protein degradation, and promotes RNA and protein synthesis

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/5636369b-711f-4708-9765-0005483bed01)

**Figure. 6.** ABC Hypothesis 

<br>

>> ○ Homeotic genes A, B, and C act individually or in combination to determine the positions of the corresponding floral organs.

>> ○ Interaction of A and B genes results in petal formation at position II

>> ○ Interaction of C and B genes results in stamen formation at position III

>> ○ A gene inhibits C gene action at positions I and II, and C gene inhibits A gene action at positions III and IV

⑶ Formation of Gametophytes

> ① Formation of male gametophyte

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Microsporocytes (2n) undergo meiosis to produce 4 microspores (n)

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Each microspore undergoes mitosis to produce a generative cell (n) and a tube cell (n)

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Pollen grain = Generative cell (n) × 1 + Tube cell (n) × 1

>>> ○ Tube cell: Involved in pollen tube growth

>>> ○ During fertilization, generative cell undergoes mitosis to become 2 cells

> ② Formation of female gametophyte

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Megaspore mother cell (2n) undergoes meiosis to produce 4 megaspores (n)

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Only 1 of the 4 megaspores survives

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Surviving megaspore undergoes 3 rounds of nuclear division without cytoplasm division to form an embryo sac with 8 nuclei

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Female gametophyte = Egg cell + Synergids × 2 + Polar Nuclei × 2 + Antipodal cells × 3

⑷ Pollination

> ① Anemophily: Petals, nectar absent; abundant pollen, sticky or feathery stigmas

> ② Entomophily: Pollination by bees, moths & butterflies, birds, flies, bats; various floral adaptations

> ③ Hydrophily

⑸ Self-Incompatibility: Rejection of pollen from one's own flowers

> ① Sporophytic Self-Incompatibility

>> ○ The S allele of the sporophyte that produced the pollen is important.

>> ○ When S1 pollen from a sporophyte with (S1, S2) lands on a pistil with (S2, S3), the pollen tube fails to germinate because the S1 pollen was produced by a sporophyte carrying the S2 allele.

> ② Gametophytic Self-Incompatibility

>> ○ S-alleles of pollen tube is crucial

>> ○ When pollen grains with S1 and S2 pollen tubes, produced by a sporophyte with (S1, S2), land on a pistil with (S2, S3), the pollen with the S1 pollen tube is able to germinate, while the pollen with the S2 pollen tube fails to germ.

> ③ Prevention of Self-Pollination by Flower Morphology

>> ○ Example: Different flower types: Pin and thrum flowers

> ④ Pollen from the same species binds weakly to the stigma through cell-to-cell signaling mediated by the cell wall.

⑹ Fertilization

> ① Process

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Pollen consists of generative cell (n) and tube cell (n)

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Pollen lands on stigma, absorbs moisture, germinates

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Pollen tube grows through style, elongates into ovary, reaches ovule

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Generative cell in pollen tube undergoes mitosis to become two generative cells

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Chemicals secreted by the synergids attract pollen tube, guiding it to grow toward the embryo sac.

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. When the pollen tube reaches the embryo sac, one of the synergid cells degenerates, providing a pathway into the ovule.

>> ○ 7<sup>th</sup>. Two generative cells move from pollen tube to ovule

>> ○ 8<sup>th</sup>. One generative cell fertilizes egg cell, forming zygote

>> ○ 9<sup>th</sup>. The oher generative cell fuses with two polar nuclei, forming triploid (3n).

> ② Double Fertilization: **Angiosperms**

>> ○ Generative cell (n) + Egg cell (n) → Embryo (2n)

>> ○ Generative cell (n) + Polar nuclei (n) × 2 → Endosperm (3n)

> ③ Single Fertilization: **Gymnosperms**

>> ○ Generative cell (n) + Egg cell (n) → Embryo (2n)

>> ○ The primary endosperm cell (i.e., the female haploid, n) develops without fertilization, forming a haploid endosperm (n).

⑺ Seed Development

> ① Dicotyledonous Plants

>> ○ Composed of the embryo, endosperm, cotyledon, and seed coat

>> ○ Embryo = hypocotyl + radicle + epicotyl + plumule

> ② Monocotyledonous Plants

>> ○ Composed of the embryo, endosperm, scutellum (cotyledon), and seed coat/pericarp

>> ○ Embryo = plumule + coleoptile + radicle + coleorhiza

>> ○ Seeds primarily develop from the endosperm

⑻ Seed: A zygote that has developed from the fertilized ovule

> ① Embryogenesis 

>> ○ Of the two daughter cells formed through mitosis, one develops into the embryo, while the other becomes the suspensor, a supporting structure.

>> ○ Development of endosperm: Initial endosperm nucleus undergoes successive nuclear divisions to enclose the zygote, then forms cell walls

>> ○ Embryo Development

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Adequate endosperm development

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Development of zygote to embryo 

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Inner cells form rounded embryo

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Outer cells form suspensor

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Lower cells of suspensor absorb water, expanding to become basal cells

>> ○ Growth of cotyledons (in dicotyledons): The globular embryo develops into a heart-shaped form → the two lobes of the heart shape develop into cotyledons (in monocotyledons, a single cotyledon forms through unilateral growth) → the cotyledons absorb nutrients from the endosperm, leading to the torpedo stage → at the point where the cotyledons separate, the shoot apical meristem is formed → it develops into the epicotyl.

>> ○ Hypocotyl (e.g., root apical meristem)

> ② Initiation of Three Primary Meristems

>> ○ Protoderm: Outer surface of embryo → Develops into epidermis

>> ○ Procambium: Central region of the embryonic axis → Primary phloem and xylem

>> ○ Ground meristem: Located between the protoderm and the procambium

⑼ Fruit: A fertilized ovule developed from the ovary (e.g., corn, cereals)

> ① Simple Fruit: Develops from one or many fused carpels.

> ② Aggregate Fruit: Develops from separate carpels in a single flower.

> ③ Multiple Fruit: Develops from a cluster of flowers.

> ④ Accessory Fruit: Develops from structures other than the ovary.

> ① Cuttings: From transplanted branches

> ② Adventitious buds

> ③ Leaf propagation

> ④ Runner/stolon: In potatoes, tubers develop as reproductive organs.

> ⑤ Tuber

> ⑥ Rhizome: In sweet potatoes, the primary root develops into a storage root.

> ⑦ Bulbs and corms

 ⑵ Apomixis: 100% inheritance of genes to offspring

> ① Megaspore mother cell directly forms diploid embryo without undergoing meiosis

> ② Apomixis-capable species select apomixis pathway when favorable, but main evolutionary path remains sexual

 ⑶ Applications of Apomixis

> ① Grafting
