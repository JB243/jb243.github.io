## **1.** **Plant Kingdom**

 ⑴ Characteristics: Traits shared by all terrestrial plants

> ① Photoautotrophic Nutrition: Chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids

> ② Multicellular eukaryotic cells with differentiated tissues

> ③ Main component of cell walls is cellulose

>> ○ Rosette-type cellulose synthesizing enzymes: Shared only by algae and terrestrial plants

> ④ Non-motile

> ⑤ Adaptation to terrestrial life

>> ○ Terrestrial environment is dry: Waxy cuticle layer with high waterproofing ability developed on the surface

>> ○ Developed from differentiation of roots, stems, and leaves

>> ○ Vascular bundles like xylem and phloem are developed (Exception: Bryophyta)

> ⑥ Alternation of generations

> ⑦ Dependent on external fertilization

> ⑧ Sporangia produce spores with walls

> ⑨ Multicellular gametangia

> ⑩ Meristematic tissue

 ⑵ Evolution

> ① Existed on land for over 400 million years

>> ○ First terrestrial plants: Small, lacking vascular tissues

>> ○ Evolution of vascular tissues led to the emergence of large trees, enabling growth in dry areas

>> ○ Seeds: Adaptation to dry terrestrial environments

> ② Evolution of flowers: Most modern plants are flowering plants that appeared around 140 million years ago.

>> ○ Diversification of angiosperms led to double fertilization and 150 families, over 90% of modern plants through adaptive radiation.

>> ○ Double fertilization: Pollen tube delivers two sperm cells, one fertilizes the egg cell to become the zygote (2n), the other fuses with two polar nuclei to form the endosperm (3n)

> ③ No nutrient provisioning until the egg cell is fertilized

> ④ Assisted by animals, wind, water, etc., for fertilization

 ⑶ Comparison between Algae and Plants

> ① Habitat: Algae inhabit water, plants inhabit land

> ② Roots: Algae have rhizoids, plants have roots

> ③ Stems: Algae supported by water buoyancy, plants supported by stems

> ④ Leaves: Algae photosynthesize throughout the body, plants mainly in leaves

ited in secondary cell wall, makes it rigid

> ③ Secondary growth in trees

>> ○ Except for companion cells, epidermal cells have no chloroplasts.

> ③ Companion cells: Related to plasmodesmata

>> ○ The higher the K+ and Cl- content inside companion cells, and the higher the turgor pressure of companion cells, the larger the size of plasmodesmata.

> ① Root cap

>> ○ Observed in leguminous plants

>> ○ Rhizobium: Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, susceptible to oxygen due to nitrogenase enzyme

>> ○ Symbiosis: Plants provide nutrients to Rhizobium, which supplies nitrogen compounds to plants

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Rhizobium secretes enzymes to degrade cell walls

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Rhizobium penetrates into the root hair

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Rhizobia move to the cortex as infection threads, developing bacteroids in the peribacteroid membrane

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Infected cortex and endodermal cells continue to grow, forming nodule primordium

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Decreased oxygen concentration occurs

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Formation of lignin-rich casparian strip restricts oxygen movement

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Leghemoglobin (iron-containing) binds oxygen, leading to oxygen depletion

>> ○ 7<sup>th</sup>. Bacteroids in the nodule fix nitrogen using nitrogenase enzyme

>> ○ 8<sup>th</sup>. Nitrogen fixation: N2 → NH3 → NH4+, requires 16 ATP

## **6\. Plant Physiology**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Material Transport Pathways

>> ○ Apoplast Pathway: Pathway along the apoplast

>>> ○ Apoplast: Extracellular matrix located outside the plasma membrane, including cell walls and intercellular spaces, as well as dead cells such as tracheids and vessel elements.

>>> ○ Active transport through the Casparian strip and use of energy due to the H+ concentration gradient

>> ○ Symplast Pathway: Pathway through the symplast

>>> ○ Symplast: Continuous network of living protoplasts within the plant

>>> ○ Material transport without the use of energy

>>> ○ Example: Intercellular spaces in the phloem

>> ○ Transmembrane Pathway

> ② Water Potential

>> ○ Water moves from areas of high water potential to areas of low water potential.

>> ○ Important for explaining the mechanism of water movement from roots to leaves

>> ○ Water potential = Solute potential + Pressure potential

>>> ○ Solute potential: π = -CRT (C: Molar concentration), related to osmotic pressure

>>> ○ Pressure potential: Turgor pressure, pressure exerted by cell walls on cells

>> ○ Gradient of water potential: Soil > Root epidermis > Root cortex > Root stele > Stem > Leaf > Atmosphere

>> ○ Primary driving force: **Cohesion-Tension Theory**

>>> ○ Cohesion-Tension Theory: Transpiration at leaves leads to water molecules with strong cohesion being pulled upward due to evaporation

>> ○ Secondary driving force: **Root Pressure**

> ③ Phloem Loading and Transport

>> ○ Source: Tissues where photosynthesis and starch breakdown lead to net production of sugars (e.g., leaves)

>>> ○ Lower turgor pressure in source tissue compared to sink tissue

>> ○ Sink: Sinks are tissues that consume or store sugars, such as roots (sugar storage), fruits (sugar storage)

>> ○ Storage as starch, transport as sugars

>>> ○ Reason: Sugars are non-reducing sugars

>>> ○ Types of sugar transporters: Monosaccharide Transporters (MST), Sucrose Transporters (SUT), Sucrose and Hexose Transporter (SWEET)

>> ○ Pressure Flow Model: Water is pushed into the sieve tube elements of source tissues and then moves to sink tissues due to pressure differences

>>> ○ Bulk flow: Movement of solution driven by pressure potential

>>> ○ Sink tissues have higher osmotic pressure, so sap is drawn in

>>> ○ Source tissues have lower osmotic pressure to allow sap to be expelled

>>> ○ Sugar concentration is higher in source tissues

>> ○ Bidirectional sugar transport across sink tissues through translocation

 ⑵ Root Material Transport

> ① Casparian Strip

>> ○ Impermeable layer made of suberin

>> ○ For water to reach the vascular cylinder of the root, it must pass through the endodermis and its symplast

>>> ○ Prevents unnecessary or toxic substances from entering

>>> ○ Prevents leakage of substances stored in the vascular cylinder into the soil

> ② Cation Exchange: Root hairs actively transport H+ into the soil, allowing absorption of mineral cations

>> ○ Electric gradient leads to separation of mineral cations from soil particles, facilitating absorption

>> ○ H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase used during active transport of H<sup>+</sup>.

>> ○ H<sup>+</sup> - mineral cation co-transporter used during mineral cation absorption

>> ○ H<sup>+</sup> re-enters the cell along its concentration gradient, leading to increased cell membrane potential, compensated by anion uptake

> ③ Nitrate Transporter

>> ○ High Affinity Transporter (HAT): Functions regardless of nitrate concentration

>> ○ Low Affinity Transporter (LAT): Leads to rapid membrane depolarization (nitrate uptake) if nitrate concentration is high

>> ○ Cycloheximide: Inhibitor of low affinity transporters

 ⑶ Stem Material Transport

> ① Movement of sap occurs due to bulk flow

> ② Main component of sap: Sugars

 ⑷ Leaf Material Transport

> ① Stoma (stomate, pore)

>> ○ Gap between two specialized epidermal cells (guard cells)

>> ○ Pathway for water and carbon dioxide

> ② Stomatal Opening and Closure

>> ○ Cellulose microfibers radiate from guard cell walls

>> ○ Increase in guard cell turgor pressure leads to guard cells expanding radially → stomatal opening

> ③ Mechanism of Stomatal Opening

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Blue Light Signal

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Blue light → Blue light receptor (Zeacretein)

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Signal transmission by the blue light receptor

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Proton pumps in guard cells export H+ outside the cell through the plasma membrane

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>. H+ and K+ enter the cell through cotransport along their concentration gradients

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 5<sup>th</sup>. Cl- enters the cell to balance charge

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 6<sup>th</sup>. Increase in sucrose concentration in guard cells

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 7<sup>th</sup>. Increase in water entry into guard cells

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 8<sup>th</sup>. Increase in guard cell turgor pressure

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 9<sup>th</sup>. Guard cells swell, leading to stomatal opening

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Red Light Signal

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Increased photosynthesis rate leads to increased sugar production and sucrose concentration → 1<sup>st</sup> \- 6<sup>th</sup>

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Decreased CO2 pressure leads to K+ and Cl- uptake → 1<sup>st</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>

>>> ○ Every CO<sub>2</sub> molecule results in the loss of 40 water molecules

>> ○ Blue light response is faster than red light response

> ④ Mechanism of Stomatal Closure

>> ○ Evening: Decrease in blue light, decrease in sugar → reverse mechanism of stomatal opening → water loss → stomatal closure

>> ○ Water stress

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Increased ABA: Cells with chloroplasts produce ABA, mainly transported by phloem. Increases with pH.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Without water stress: ABA-H+ form → uptake by mesophyll cells → reduced accessibility to guard cells → maintained stomatal opening

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. ABA reaches guard cells → signal transduction pathway

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. K+, Cl-, and water are expelled from guard cells

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Stomatal closure
