## **1. Basics**

⑴ Components of a graph 

> ① V: Node

> ② E: Edge

> ③ G: Graph 

> ④ V(G) = {v<sub>1</sub>, ···, v<sub>n</sub>}

> ⑤ v<sub>i</sub> ~ v<sub>j</sub>: When edge e<sub>ij</sub> connects vertices v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>. 

⑵ Degree of Graph G **:** Number of nodes, i.e., |V(G)|

⑶ Size of Graph G **:** Number of edges, i.e., |E(G)|

⑷ Degree of node v **:** Number of edges connected to node v, i.e., deg(v). 

> ① deg(v<sub>i</sub>) = ∑<sub>v<sub>i</sub>~v<sub>j</sub></sub> 1

> ② δ(G) refers to the minimum degree of nodes in G, and Δ(G) refers to the maximum degree of nodes in G.

> ③ ∑ deg(v<sub>i</sub>) = 2 | E(G) |

> ④ If all the nodes of a graph have the same degree, the graph is regular.

> ⑤ The nodes of an Eulerian graph have even degree.

⑸ Simple graph and complete graph

> ① Simple graph **:** A graph in which at most one edge exists between any two nodes, and self-loops (edges connecting a node to itself) are not allowed.

**Figure 2.** Complete Graph

<br>

>> ○ strongly connected (= irreducible) **:** A state where any node i can reach any other node j within the graph.

>> ○ The number of edges in a complete graph is <sub>N</sub>C<sub>2</sub> = N(N-1) / 2.

⑹ Subgraph: H is a subgraph of G if V(H) ⊆ V(G) and E(H) ⊆ E(G).

> ① A subgraph H is an induced subgraph of G if two vertices of V(H) are adjacent if and only if they are adjacent in G.

> ② clique: a complete subgraph of a graph.

> ③ Walk **:** A path like v<sub>0</sub> → v<sub>1</sub> → ... → v<sub>m</sub>, connected by edges v<sub>0</sub>v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>m-1</sub>v<sub>m</sub>.

>> ○ v<sub>0</sub> is called the initial vertex, and v<sub>m</sub> is called the final vertex.

>> ○ The number of edges in the walk is called the length.

> ④ Path: A walk where all nodes are distinct.

> ⑤ Cycle: A walk where v<sub>0</sub> = v<sub>m</sub>.

> ⑥ Forest: A graph containing no cycles.

> ⑦ Tree: A connected forest

> ⑧ Period **:** The period of a node i is the greatest common divisor of all paths from node i to itself.

>> ○ Example **:** If two nodes A and B are connected by two edges such that A = B, the period of each node is 2.

> ⑨ Aperiodic **:** When the period of all nodes is 1.

>> ○ aperiodic ⊂ irreduicible

>> ○ Example **:** A walk where each node has a path leading back to itself is aperiodic.

> ⑩ Regular

>> ○ regular ⊂ irreducible

>> ○ For some natural number k, all elements of the k-th power of the transition matrix M, M<sup>k</sup>, are positive (i.e., non-zero values).

⑺ Types of graph

> ① Undirected graph: A graph with undirected edges

> ② Directed graph: A graph with directed edges

> ③ k-partite graph: If its set of vertices admits a partition into k classes such that the vertices of the same class are not adjacent.

⑻ Centrality of a network

> ① Degree centrality shows people with many social connections.

> ② Closeness centrality indicates who is at the heart of a social network.

> ③ Betweenness centrality describes people who connect social circles.

> ④ Eigenvector centrality is high among influential people in the network.

⑼ Adjacency matrix: Represented as **A**.

> ① Definition: When the number of nodes is n, an n × n adjacency matrix is defined as, A<sub>i,j</sub> = 1 (if v<sub>i</sub> ~ v<sub>j</sub>), A<sub>i,j</sub> = 0 (otherwise)

>> ○ Transition matrix of Markov chain: **L**<sup>t</sup> = **D**<sup>-1</sup>**A** 

>> ○ Random-walk graph Laplacian: **L**<sub>r</sub> = **D**<sup>-1</sup>**L** = **I** - **L**<sub>t</sub> = **D**<sup>-1/2</sup>**L**<sub>n</sub>**D**<sup>1/2</sup>

> ③ **Feature 1.** **L** has an eigenvalue of 0. **L1**<sub>n</sub> = **0** 

>> ○ If there are k disconnected graphs, there are k eigenvalues of 0.

>> ○ The closer the eigenvalue is to 0, the more connected the graph is.

>> ○ Fiedler vector: The eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue after λ<sub>1</sub> = 0. It represents the overall structure of the graph.

> ④ **Feature 2.** (**Lf**)(v<sub>i</sub>) = ∑<sub>v<sub>j</sub>~v<sub>i</sub></sub> (f(v<sub>i</sub>) - f(v<sub>j</sub>)): Refer to **Fig. 4**.

<br>

<img width="208" alt="스크린샷 2024-10-12 오후 5 48 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcc9719d-68a7-43ca-8d7f-31dfc60aa919">

<br>

>> ○ **Step 2:** Based on the adjacency matrix, calculate the Laplacian matrix: **L**<sub>n</sub> or **L**<sub>r</sub> can also be used.

>> ○ **Step 3:** Calculate the matrix of eigenvectors **W** = [**ω**<sub>2</sub>, ···, **ω**<sub>k</sub>] ∈ ℝ<sup>n×k</sup> corresponding to the k smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix.

>>> ○ Exclude **ω**<sub>1</sub> = 1, which corresponds to λ<sub>1</sub> = 0, as it is trivial.

>> ○ **Step 4:** The n data points are naturally embedded into k dimensions: **Y** = **W**<sup>T</sup> = [**y**<sub>1</sub>, ⋯, **y**<sub>n</sub>], with each column vector representing the embedded data points.

>> ○ **Step 5:** Perform clustering, such as K-means clustering, on the column vectors of **Y**.

⑿ Degree distribution **:** The ratio of nodes with degree k among all nodes, i.e., P(k) = N<sub>k</sub> / |V(G)|.

⒀ Distance **:** The length of the shortest path between two nodes. If no such path exists, the distance is defined as ∞.

⒁ Clustering coefficient **:** If the degree of a specific node is k<sub>i</sub> and the number of edges between the surrounding nodes connected to that node is e<sub>i</sub>, then:

<br>

> ① For example, if A is connected to B, C, and D, and there are additional edges B-C and C-D, then for A, e<sub>i</sub> = 2, k<sub>i</sub> = 3, C<sub>i</sub> = 2 / 3.

> ② k<sub>i</sub> (k<sub>i</sub> - 1) / 2 **:** The maximum number of edges that could be formed between the surrounding nodes.

> ③ C<sub>i</sub> has a value between 0 and 1, with a value close to 1 indicating that the surrounding nodes are fully connected.
