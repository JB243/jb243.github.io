## **1. Definition of Living Organisms**

⑴ **Definition 1.** Organisms grow, move, reproduce, respond to stimuli, and have metabolism.

> ① Is fire a living organism and a donkey not?

 ⑵ **Definition 2.** Defined as an organism if all the following conditions are met:

> ① Possesses a common set of biomolecules.

> ② Maintains homeostasis.

> ③ Capable of evolution.

> ④ Requires water.

<br>

<br>

## **2. Water and Carbon**

⑴ H<sub>2</sub>O

> ① Polarity: Oxygen has high electronegativity, attracting electrons from hydrogen, causing a slight negative charge. Conversely, the hydrogen side has a slight positive charge.

> ② Hydrogen Bonds: Molecular attraction between hydrogen and electronegative atoms (i.e., F, O, N).

>> ○ Water molecules cohere due to hydrogen bonds.

>> ○ A water molecule can form hydrogen bonds at four sites

<br>

>>> ○ Inosinic acid (I)

⑵ Polynucleotide

> ① Phosphodiester bond: Dehydration condensation between the 3'-OH of the first sugar and the 5'-ⓟⓟⓟ of the second sugar in nucleotides.

> ② Polymerization occurs in the 5'-3' direction and is an endothermic reaction. Energy is supplied as two molecules of pyrophosphate (PPi) are released from the triphosphate.

> ③ The 5' end has a free phosphate group, known as the γ phosphate, exposed.

⑶ DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)

> ① Function: Storing genetic information, RNA transcription

> ② Increase in pH: When the pH exceeds 10, the hydrogen involved in hydrogen bonding dissociates, causing the double strand to separate into single strands.

> ③ Increase in temperature: Increased kinetic energy of polynucleotides breaks hydrogen bonds between strands, leading to separation into single strands.

> ④ T<sub>m</sub>: Temperature at which 50% of double-stranded DNA becomes single-stranded.

>> ○ Higher G≡C ratio increases bonding strength, thus increasing T<sub>m</sub>.

>> ○ Higher amounts of added NaCl counteract repulsion between phosphate groups, thus increasing T<sub>m</sub>.

>> ○ Extremely low pH: H<sup>+</sup> interferes with hydrogen bonds, decreasing T<sub>m</sub>. DNA and RNA degrade in strong acids.

>> ○ Extremely high pH: Separates double-stranded DNA into single strands.

> ⑤ Renaturation kinetics: The study of the extent to which a DNA double helix is restored after denaturation.

>> ○ Regions with high frequency of repetitive sequences denature (ds DNA → ss DNA) first and renature first.

>> ○ High-frequency repetitive sequences: Centromere, etc.

>> ○ Moderate-frequency repetitive sequences: Telomeres, etc.

> ⑥ DNA Absorbance Experiment

>> ○ At 260 nm, absorbance of 1 corresponds to 50 μg / mL dsDNA concentration.

>> ○ At 260 nm, absorbance of 1 corresponds to 40 μg / mL ssRNA concentration.

> ⑦ Thermophiles: High G≡C content, increased histones, and supercoiled structures.

⑷ RNA (ribonucleic acid)

> ① Function: Transmission of genetic information and polypeptide synthesis.

> ② Increase in pH: The H+ of the 2'-OH group in RNA dissociates → Hydration → Hydrolysis, leading to RNA breaking into fragments.

> ③ Circular RNA is more stable than linear RNA.

**Table 2.** Comparison of DNA and RNA

<br>

> ① Complementarity: The property that allows restoration of information using the other strand when one strand is damaged.

> ② Sugar: Deoxyribose has a -H group at the 2nd carbon. Ribose has a -OH (more reactive) group at the 2nd carbon.

> ③ Instability of RNA

>> ○ Ribose: Increased reactivity due to 2'-OH group.

>> ○ Single-strand: Cannot be corrected or repaired, easily affected by external substances.

>> ○ Deamination process: Amino bases A and C can undergo deamination.

>>> ○ Loss of amino group in C base: Becomes U base. A base becomes I.

>>> ○ DNA can be corrected, but RNA cannot.

>> ○ RNA undergoes hydrolysis with increased pH.

⑷ Eukaryotic Chromatin

> ① DNA as genetic material

>> ○ In 1871, Fredrich Miescher first reported DNA in the nucleus.

>> ○ **Evidence 1.** Chargaff's rules: [A] = [T], [G] = [C]

>> ○ **Evidence 2.** X-ray diffraction analysis: Rosalind Elsie Franklin's diffraction research played a key role in revealing the structure of DNA.

> ③ RNA structure: Most RNA with 3D structure is less than 150 nt in length.

> ④ Nucleosome (beads-on-a-string, bead-on-string): Also called 10 nm fiber.

>> ○ Structure

>>> ○ 146 bp of DNA wraps around a histone octamer (composed of one pair each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) with 1.65 turns.

>>> ○ Linker DNA: Refers to DNA from H1 to H1. About 200 nucleotides.

>>> ○ When treated with endonuclease, H1 to H1 gets cut → visible in electrophoresis.

>> ○ H1: Adjusts nucleosome structure. One per nucleosome. Involved in chromatin condensation.

>> ○ Histone and DNA Binding

>>> ○ Over 20% of the amino acids in histones are basic amino acids with a positive charge (e.g., Lys, Arg).

>>> ○ Ionic bonds form between the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA and the positively charged histone proteins.

>> ○ Histone Tail: The N-terminal of the histone molecule within the nucleosome that protrudes outward.

>> ○ [Histone Modification](https://jb243.github.io/pages/74): Histone acetylation, histone deacetylation, histone methylation, histone phosphorylation

> ⑤ 30 nm Fiber: The structure formed when the 10 nm fiber is wound and folded.

> ⑦ Chromatin

>> ○ Types of Chromatin

>>> ○ **Type 1.** Euchromatin: Uncondensed chromatin.

>>> ○ **Type 2.** Heterochromatin: Condensed chromatin. Typically centromeres, telomeres exist in heterochromatin form.

>> ○ Structure of Chromatin

>>> ○ TAD (topologically associating domain): Chromatin forming loops.

>>> ○ The actual shape of TAD is complex and tangled like a ball of yarn.

>>> ○ CTCF (11-zinc finger protein, CCCTC-binding factor): A transcription factor encoded by the _CTCF_ gene.

>>> ○ CTCF and PDS5A/B determine the boundaries and loop anchors of TAD.

>>> ○ WAPL (responsible for releasing cohesin from chromosomes) and PDS5A/B determine the length of the loops.

> ⑧ Chromosome: The width of a single chromatid is 700 nm.

⑸ Polytene Chromosome (giant chromosome)

> ① **Requirement 1.** Related to Mitosis.

> ② **Requirement 2.** A giant chromosome formed by repeated DNA replication (only the S phase occurs) without nuclear or cytoplasmic division (no division phase), maintaining a folded state.

> ③ Endoreduplication

>> ○ Definition: The process of repeatedly synthesizing DNA without the division phase (M phase). Does not form sister chromatids.

>> ○ Location: Ovary nurse cell, follicle cell, abdominal histoblast, fat body cell, gut cell, prepupal salivary gland cell in Drosophila.

>> ○ Result: Formation of polyploidy

> ④ Composed of more than 1,000 identical DNA molecules.

> ⑤ Staining reveals alternating dark and light bands.

>> ○ Less condensed light bands are areas of active transcription.

>> ○ Conversely, dark areas are where transcription is suppressed.

> ⑥ Puff: An area in the polytene chromosome where the light bands locally unravel and expand.

>> ○ Puffs are observed in regions with vigorous gene expression.

>> ○ The location of puffs varies depending on developmental stages and internal or external signals.

> ⑦ Chromocenter: Not all DNA in chromosomes is polytenic.

>> ○ Exists as highly condensed heterochromatin.

>> ○ Non-polytenic and exhibits minimal transcriptional activity.

>> ○ Salivary gland chromosomes cluster at the chromocenters.

>> ○ DNA in these regions accounts for about 30% of the genome and has very low gene density.

>> ○ Puffs are observed in regions with active gene expression.

> ⑧ Example: Salivary chromosomes of dipteran insects
