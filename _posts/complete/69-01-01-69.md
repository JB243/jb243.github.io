>> ○ Exothermic reaction: ΔH < 0, related to catabolism.

>> ○ Endothermic reaction: ΔH > 0, related to anabolism.

> ③ Even if a reaction is spontaneous, the reaction rate can be slow if the activation energy (threshold energy) is too high.

> ④ Activation energy

>> ○ Definition: Minimum energy required for reaction molecules to trigger chemical reactions.

>> ○ Lower activation energy increases the reaction rate by increasing the number of molecules that can react.

>> ○ Catalyst: Combines with the reactant substrate to lower the activation energy and increase the reaction rate.

>> ○ Lock and key model: A model suggesting that the enzyme's active site perfectly matches the substrate.

>> ○ Induced Fit Model: A model suggesting that when an enzyme binds to a substrate, it changes into a completely complementary shape to fit the substrate.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The shape of the substrate is roughly similar to the enzyme's active site.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. When the substrate binds to the active site, the enzyme changes shape and applies pressure on the chemical bonds.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. This shape change breaks down the substrate and releases its monomers.

>> ○ Isozyme (enzyme multiplicity)

>>> ○ Different enzymes involved in the same biochemical reaction.

>>> ○ Have different characteristics depending on the cell that acts (e.g., hexokinase, lactose dehydrogenase (LDH))

> ④ Electrostatic catalysis

> ⑤ Proximity and orientation effects

> ⑥ Preferential binding of the transition state complex

⑷ Factors affecting the action of enzymes

> ① **Factor 1.** Substrate concentration

>> ○ Related to Michaelis-Menten equation

>> ○ Initial reaction rate increases with increasing substrate concentration and then becomes constant after reaching a certain level.

>> ○ Once all the enzymes are saturated with the substrate, the initial reaction rate no longer increases with increasing substrate concentration.

> ② **Factor 2.** Temperature

>> ○ As temperature increases, the number of molecules with kinetic energy above the activation energy increases, increasing the reaction rate.

>> ○ The chemical reaction involving enzymes is the fastest at the optimum temperature at which the enzyme has the optimum structure.

>> ○ If the temperature exceeds the optimal level, the protein undergoes irreversible denaturation due to heat and cannot recover even if the temperature is reduced.

> ③ **Factor 3.** pH

>> ○ The chemical reaction involving enzymes is the fastest at the optimum pH.

>> ○ The charged state of the amino acid residues that make up the enzyme depends on the change in the concentration of hydrogen ions, so if it is out of optimum pH, it changes the net charge of the protein, causing electrostatic repulsion and altering the structure of the enzyme.

>> ○ Examples of optimum pH

>>> ○ Pepsin: pH = 1.5

>>> ○ Catalace: pH = 7.6

>>> ○ Trypsin: pH = 7.7

>>> ○ Fumarase: pH = 7.8

⑹ Michaelis-Menten equation

⑺ Inhibitor: In living organisms, feedback inhibition mechanisms exist to regulate enzymes, but unlike inhibitors, the reactions are reversible.

> ① Irreversible inhibition

>> ○ **Example 1.** Penicillin

>>> ○ A bacterium cell wall (peptidoglycan) transpeptidase inhibitor, potent because it has a semi-permanent covalent bond with the active site

>>> ○ Highly effective due to its semi-permanent covalent binding to the active site.

>> ○ Example 2. Sarin Gas

>>> ○ Acetylcholine is broken down into choline and acetic acid. Acetic acid dissociates into acetate ions and H<sup>+</sup>.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Sarin gas irreversibly binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Acetylcholine levels increase (↑). 

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Results in muscle spasms, pupil constriction, confusion, and respiratory distress.

> ② Reversible inhibition

>> ○ Classified into competitive inhibition, uncompetitive inhibition, and noncompetitive inhibition.

>> ○ When discussing competitive, uncompetitive, or noncompetitive inhibition, the distinction between reversible and irreversible inhibition is often not emphasized.

> ③ Competitive inhibition

>> ○ Competes with the substrate for the same active site, inhibiting the enzymatic reaction.

>> ○ Michaelis-Menten equation

>> ○ Does not alter the shape of the active enzyme.

>> ○ Example

>>> ○ Ibuprofen: Inhibits prostaglandin production.

>>> ○ Statin-HMG-CoA reductase

>>> ○ Ras phosphorylation of Gleevec-Bcl-abr

>>> ○ HIV protease inhibitors

>>> ○ Antidepressants, antibiotics, and insecticides

> ④ Uncompetitive inhibition

>> ○ An inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, inhibiting the enzymatic reaction.

<br>

> ⑤ Noncompetitive inhibitors

>> ○ Inhibits the enzymatic reaction by binding to an allosteric site other than the active site, resulting in noncompetitive participation in the enzymatic reaction.

>> ○ Michaelis-Menten equation

<br>

<img width="591" alt="스크린샷 2024-12-10 오전 9 05 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32211889-89a2-447e-a6fc-c13e246243a0">

>> ○ Changes the form of active enzymes.

⑻ Cooperative

> ① Regulation of enzyme activity by the substrate itself, rather than inhibitors or activators.

> ② Positive cooperativity: In multi-substrate enzymes, the binding of one substrate facilitates the binding of additional substrates.

> ③ Negative cooperativity: Exists but is extremely rare.

> ④ Reaction Formula: In the presence of cooperativity, once ES<sub>1</sub> is formed, ES<sub>n</sub> is rapidly generated, so there is no need to consider intermediate states such as ES<sub>1</sub>, ..., ES<sub>n-1</sub>.

> ⑤ **Example:** [Hemoglobin](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2209) oxygen saturation

>> ○ Hemoglobin consists of four subunits, each with an oxygen-binding site.

>> ○ Hemoglobin exhibits an oxygen saturation curve with a sigmoid shape.

>> ○ When one oxygen molecule binds to a site, the oxygen affinity of the remaining binding sites increases.

>> ○ However, in regions with low oxygen, once one oxygen molecule dissociates, the rest are also likely to dissociate.

>> ○ Myoglobin, with a single subunit, lacks cooperativity and therefore shows a hyperbolic oxygen saturation curve.

⑼ Enzyme activity regulation mechanisms

> ① Regulation by suppressor 

> ② Regulation by cooperativity

> ③ Allosteric control 

>> ○ Regulatory molecule: A small molecule that binds to a protein, altering its three-dimensional structure and thereby changing its function.

>>> ○ Regulatory molecules are not substrates.

>>> ○ Regulatory molecules include inhibitors or activators.

>> ○ Allosteric regulation

>>> ○ Refers to the binding of activators or inhibitors to sites other than the substrate binding site, modulating the enzyme's activity.

>>> ○ These alternative binding sites are called allosteric sites.

>>> ○ Allosteric regulation occurs in enzymes involved in irreversible reactions.

>> ○ Example: ATP acts as an inhibitor, and ADP as an activator, to regulate enzymes involved in cellular respiration.

>>> ○ PFK-1 (Phosphofructokinase-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of F-6-ⓟ (fructose-6-phosphate) to F-1,6-bisphosphate.

>>> ○ ATP, as a substrate of PFK-1, also serves as an allosteric regulator of the enzyme.

>>> ○ A graph plotting ATP concentration on the x-axis and PFK-1 activity on the y-axis forms a bell-shaped curve.

>> ○ **Application 1.** Inhibitors

>>> ○ General allosteric regulation does not completely block reactions as inhibitors do.

>>> ○ The binding of an inhibitor to an enzyme, triggering allosteric regulation, is referred to as noncompetitive inhibition.

>>> ○ Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site, where the substrate attaches, rather than to a different site, and thus are not considered allosteric regulation.

>> ○ **Application 2.** Feedback Inhibition

>>> ○ Refers to a mechanism where the final product of a metabolic pathway binds to an enzyme involved in the initial steps, suppressing the pathway and regulating metabolism.

> ④ Regulation through phosphorylation

> ⑤ Regulatory proteins

>> ○ Example: NO synthase regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>\-Calmodulin

>> ○ Spun fiber

>> ○ Gel matrix

>> ○ Micro-capsule

> ② Chemical bonding: A chemical enzyme immobilization method that uses chemical forces between the functional group of an enzyme and the surface functional group of a carrier to fix the enzyme.

> ③ Effective factor = Reaction rate with diffusion limitation / Reaction rate without diffusion limitation

>> ○ How much better the reaction rate was by immobilizing the enzyme.

>> ○ The higher enzyme concentration, the lower effective factor: Meaning that the reaction occurs well because the concentration is high regardless of fixation.
