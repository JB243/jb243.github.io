⑵ Composition of enzymes

> ① Classification of enzyme: Divided into RNA enzyme (called ribozyme) and protein enzyme. Enzyme is commonly referred to as protein enzyme.

> ② Active site: Sites that bind to the substrate.

> ② Covalent catalysis

> ③ Metal ion catalysis

> ④ Electrostatic catalysis

> ⑤ Proximity and orientation effects

> ⑥ Preferential binding of the transition state complex

⑷ Factors affecting the action of enzymes

> ① **Factor 1.** Substrate concentration

>> ○ Related to Michaelis-Menten equation

>> ○ Initial reaction rate increases with increasing substrate concentration and then becomes constant after reaching a certain level.

>> ○ Once all the enzymes are saturated with the substrate, the initial reaction rate no longer increases with increasing substrate concentration.

> ② **Factor 2.** Temperature

>> ○ As temperature increases, the number of molecules with kinetic energy above the activation energy increases, increasing the reaction rate.

>> ○ The chemical reaction involving enzymes is the fastest at the optimum temperature at which the enzyme has the optimum structure.

>> ○ If the temperature exceeds the optimal level, the protein undergoes irreversible denaturation due to heat and cannot recover even if the temperature is reduced.

> ③ **Factor 3.** pH

>> ○ The chemical reaction involving enzymes is the fastest at the optimum pH.

>> ○ The charged state of the amino acid residues that make up the enzyme depends on the change in the concentration of hydrogen ions, so if it is out of optimum pH, it changes the net charge of the protein, causing electrostatic repulsion and altering the structure of the enzyme.

>> ○ Examples of optimum pH

>>> ○ Pepsin: pH = 1.5

>>> ○ Catalace: pH = 7.6

>>> ○ Trypsin: pH = 7.7

>>> ○ Fumarase: pH = 7.8

>>> ○ Ribonucleace: pH = 7.8

>>> ○ Arginase: pH = 9.7

> ④ Enzyme reaction rate index

>> ○ 1 unit of enzyme: Enzyme activity that can produce 1 μmol of product in 1 minute.

>> ○ Enzyme activity = enzyme unit / amount of enzyme (ml)

⑹ Michaelis-Menten equation

⑺ Inhibitor: In living organisms, feedback inhibition mechanisms exist to regulate enzymes, but unlike inhibitors, the reactions are reversible.

> ① Irreversible inhibition

>> ○ **Example 1.** Penicillin

>>> ○ A bacterium cell wall (peptidoglycan) transpeptidase inhibitor, potent because it has a semi-permanent covalent bond with the active site

>>> ○ Highly effective due to its semi-permanent covalent binding to the active site.

>> ○ Example 2. Sarin Gas

>>> ○ Acetylcholine is broken down into choline and acetic acid. Acetic acid dissociates into acetate ions and H<sup>+</sup>.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Sarin gas irreversibly binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Acetylcholine levels increase (↑). 

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Results in muscle spasms, pupil constriction, confusion, and respiratory distress.

> ② Reversible inhibition

>> ○ Classified into competitive inhibition, uncompetitive inhibition, and noncompetitive inhibition.

> ③ Competitive inhibition

>>> ○ Statin-HMG-CoA reductase

>>> ○ Ras phosphorylation of Gleevec-Bcl-abr

>>> ○ HIV protease inhibitors

>>> ○ Antidepressants, antibiotics, and insecticides

> ④ Uncompetitive inhibition

>> ○ An inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, inhibiting the enzymatic reaction.

>> ○ Michaelis-Menten equation

<br>

<br>

> ⑤ Noncompetitive inhibitors

>> ○ Inhibits the enzymatic reaction by binding to an allosteric site other than the active site, resulting in noncompetitive participation in the enzymatic reaction.

>> ○ Michaelis-Menten equation

<br>

<img width="591" alt="스크린샷 2024-12-10 오전 9 05 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32211889-89a2-447e-a6fc-c13e246243a0">

<br>

>> ○ Changes the form of active enzymes.

⑻ Cooperative

> ① Regulation of enzyme activity by the substrate itself, rather than inhibitors or activators.

> ② Positive cooperativity: In multi-substrate enzymes, the binding of one substrate facilitates the binding of additional substrates.

> ③ Negative cooperativity: Exists but is extremely rare.

> ④ Reaction Formula: In the presence of cooperativity, once ES<sub>1</sub> is formed, ES<sub>n</sub> is rapidly generated, so there is no need to consider intermediate states such as ES<sub>1</sub>, ..., ES<sub>n-1</sub>.

<br>

> ⑤ **Example:** [Hemoglobin](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2209) oxygen saturation

>> ○ Hemoglobin consists of four subunits, each with an oxygen-binding site.

>> ○ Hemoglobin exhibits an oxygen saturation curve with a sigmoid shape.

>> ○ When one oxygen molecule binds to a site, the oxygen affinity of the remaining binding sites increases.

>> ○ However, in regions with low oxygen, once one oxygen molecule dissociates, the rest are also likely to dissociate.

>> ○ Myoglobin, with a single subunit, lacks cooperativity and therefore shows a hyperbolic oxygen saturation curve.

⑼ Enzyme activity regulation mechanisms

> ① Regulation by suppressor 

> ② Regulation by cooperativity

> ③ Allosteric control 

>> ○ Regulatory molecule: A small molecule that binds to a protein, altering its three-dimensional structure and thereby changing its function.

>>> ○ Regulatory molecules are not substrates.

>>> ○ Regulatory molecules include inhibitors or activators.

>> ○ Allosteric regulation

>>> ○ Refers to the binding of activators or inhibitors to sites other than the substrate binding site, modulating the enzyme's activity.

>>> ○ These alternative binding sites are called allosteric sites.

>>> ○ Allosteric regulation can occur in enzymes that catalyze reversible reactions as well as in enzymes that catalyze irreversible reactions.

>> ○ Example: ATP acts as an inhibitor, and ADP as an activator, to regulate enzymes involved in cellular respiration.

>>> ○ PFK-1 (Phosphofructokinase-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of F-6-ⓟ (fructose-6-phosphate) to F-1,6-bisphosphate.

>>> ○ ATP, as a substrate of PFK-1, also serves as an allosteric regulator of the enzyme.

>>> ○ A graph plotting ATP concentration on the x-axis and PFK-1 activity on the y-axis forms a bell-shaped curve.

>> ○ **Application 1.** Inhibitors

>>> ○ General allosteric regulation does not completely block reactions as inhibitors do.

>>> ○ The binding of an inhibitor to an enzyme, triggering allosteric regulation, is referred to as noncompetitive inhibition.

>>> ○ Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site, where the substrate attaches, rather than to a different site, and thus are not considered allosteric regulation.

>> ○ **Application 2.** Feedback Inhibition

>>> ○ Refers to a mechanism where the final product of a metabolic pathway binds to an enzyme involved in the initial steps, suppressing the pathway and regulating metabolism.

> ④ Regulation through phosphorylation

> ⑤ Regulatory proteins

>> ○ Example: NO synthase regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>\-Calmodulin

>> ○ Micro-capsule

> ② Chemical bonding: A chemical enzyme immobilization method that uses chemical forces between the functional group of an enzyme and the surface functional group of a carrier to fix the enzyme.

> ③ Effective factor = Reaction rate with diffusion limitation / Reaction rate without diffusion limitation

>> ○ How much better the reaction rate was by immobilizing the enzyme.

>> ○ The higher enzyme concentration, the lower effective factor: Meaning that the reaction occurs well because the concentration is high regardless of fixation.

>>> ○ 8<sup>th</sup>. The mature endosome merges with the [mannose pathway](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1409#2-structure-1-endomembrane) to form a complete lysosome.

>>> ○ 9<sup>th</sup>. Cholesterol is separated.

>>> ○ Inhibitors: Dynasore (dynamin inhibitor), chlorpromazine, pitstop 2

>> ○ **Example 2.** Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis (CvME)

>>> ○ Forms vesicles approximately 60 nm in size.  
 
>>> ○ Inhibitors: Dynasore, nystatin, filipin.  

>> ○ **Example 3.** Albumin pathway
  
>>> ○ **3-1.** gp60-mediated endocytosis

>>> ○ **3-2.** SPARC-mediated endocytosis  

>>> ○ **3-3.** gp18, gp30-mediated endocytosis

>>> ○ **3-4.** Megalin/cubilin-mediated endocytosis

>>> ○ **3-5.** FcRn-mediated endocytosis.  

>> ○ **Example 4.** Transcytosis: A vesicle formed through endocytosis crosses the membrane.

>> ○ **Example 5.** B Cell Receptor

>>> ○ Immature B cells express IgD, which binds antigens for uptake and fragmentation via lysosomes.

>>> ○ Fragmented antigens are labeled to MHC class II in the rough ER, converting tertiary structures to primary structures.  

>> ○ **Example 6.** Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis

>>> ○ Inhibitor: Piceatanol

>> ○ **Example 7.** [Mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1409#2-structure-1-endomembrane)

>>> ○ Inhibitor: Mannan

>> ○ **Example 8.** Intestinal epithelial cells

>>> ○ Intestinal epithelial cells position IgA towards the intestinal lumen via transcytosis to eliminate bacteria.
