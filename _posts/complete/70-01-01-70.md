## **1. Classification of Organisms Based on Energy Metabolism**

⑴ Classification based on energy source

> ① **Class 1.** Phototrophs: Organisms that use light as an energy source. Divided into photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs.

> ② **Class 2.** Chemotrophs: Organisms that use chemical energy as an energy source. Divided into chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs.

>> ○ Cyanobacteria _O. limnetica_ uses H<sub>2</sub>O as the initial electron donor when H<sub>2</sub>S is absent, and H<sub>2</sub>S when it is present.

>> ○ For Cyanobacteria _O. limnetica_, the energy source is H<sub>2</sub>S when it is used, otherwise it is light.

 ⑵ Classification based on carbon source

> ① **Class 1.** Autotrophs: Organisms with CO<sub>2</sub> as their carbon source. Divided into photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs.

> ② **Class 2.** Heterotrophs: Organisms with organic compounds as their carbon source. Divided into photoheterotrophs and chemoheterotrophs.

 ⑶ Summary: When listed by energy source, carbon source,

> ① Photoautotrophs: Light + CO<sub>2</sub>

> ① Causes conformational changes in proteins through phosphorylation to perform mechanical work, substance transport, and chemical reactions (coupled reaction molecules).

> ② Structure

>> ○ Adenine + Ribose + 3 Phosphate Molecules

>> ○ High-Energy phosphate bond: Due to electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged phosphate, it has high energy content and is unstable, thus easily hydrolyzed releasing a large amount of energy (7.3 kcal/mol).

>> ○ ATP ⇄ ADP + P<sub>i</sub> (phosphate), K = 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>

> ③ Types of Phosphorylation

>> ○ **Type 1.** Substrate-level phosphorylation: [Glycolysis](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1410) 

>> ○ **Type 2.** Photophosphorylation: [Bacteriorhodopsin](https://jb243.github.io/pages/69) 

>> ○ **Type 3.** Oxidative phosphorylation: Phosphorylation by the electron transport chain

 ⑵ NAD<sup>+</sup> (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide): Coenzyme in oxidation reactions, involved in cellular respiration.

> ① Adenine + 2 Riboses + Nicotinamide Group

>> ○ Derived from Niacin (Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> derivative)

> ② NAD<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub> ⇄ NADH + H<sup>+</sup>

>> ○ 1 molecule of NAD<sup>+</sup> carries 1 hydrogen atom and 1 electron.

>> ○ Thus, it carries 1 hydrogen ion and 2 electrons.

> ③ Mechanism: Nucleophilic aromatic addition reaction and hydride shift

## 3. Cellular Respiration

⑴ Overview of cellular respiration

> ① External respiration: Breathing in O<sub>2</sub> and releasing CO<sub>2</sub> through the lungs.

> ② Internal Respiration: Tissue cells use O<sub>2</sub> for cellular respiration and release CO<sub>2</sub>.

**Figure 5.** Electron transport system in mitochondrial inner membrane

<br>

>> ○ Redox potential of the electron transport chain

>>> ○ Reducing power: The tendency to reduce other substances. Low reducing power implies a tendency to reduce by itself.

>>> ○ Reduction potential: A higher standard reduction potential value for chemical species that tend to be reduced.

>>> ○ Gibbs free energy change: The more a chemical species prefers electrons, the more negative the change in free energy becomes.

>>> ○ Conclusion: As the reaction process progresses, reducing power decreases, reduction potential increases, and the free energy change ΔG becomes more negative.

>>> ○ For a chemical reaction to occur, ΔG ＜ 0, so ΔG must become more negative as the process progresses: ΔG<sub>earlier_step</sub> + ΔG<sub>latter_step</sub> ＜ 0

>>> ○ By using ΔG = -nFE, the relationship between reduction potential and ΔG can be easily understood.

> ④ Cellular respiration calculation

>> ○ **Yield 1.** Approximately 1 NADH → 3 ATP, 1 FADH<sub>2</sub> → 2 ATP

>> ○ **Yield 2.** For prokaryotes, fungi, algae, etc., the yield is lower: 1 NADH → 2.5 ATP, 1 FADH<sub>2</sub> → 1.5 ATP

>>> ○ 4H<sup>+</sup> are released when electrons move through complexes I and III, and 2H<sup>+</sup> are released when electrons move through complex IV.

>>>> ○ Complex IV, being closer to ATP synthase, has a difficulty in structural change and therefore has a less yield.

>>> ○ 4H<sup>+</sup> are required to synthesize 1 ATP.

>>>> ○ ATP synthase makes one turn when 3H<sup>+</sup> move.

>>>> ○ H<sup>+</sup> is consumed when pyruvate moves into the inner membrane.

>>> ○ NADH yield = Total H<sup>+</sup> moved ÷ (4 H<sup>+</sup> / 1 ATP) = (4 × 2 + 2) ÷ 4 = 2.5

>>> ○ FADH<sub>2</sub> yield = Total H+ moved ÷ (4 H<sup>+</sup> / 1 ATP) = (4 × 1 + 2) ÷ 4 = 1.5

>> ○ 2 Pyruvates enter mitochondria, undergo oxidation and citric acid cycle, producing 2 ATP + 8 NADH + 2 FADH<sub>2</sub>.

>>> ○ **Tip:** CO<sub>2</sub> release produces NADH.

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Antenna: Photons are absorbed by pigment molecules and transferred to adjacent pigment molecules by RET (resonance energy transfer).

>> ○ RET: When two molecules are close enough, photons are transferred more directly rather than through fluorescence.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Reaction center: Electrons move between pigment molecules until they reach P680 of Photosystem II or P700 of Photosystem I.

>> ○ P680 shows maximum absorption at 680 nm, P700 at 700 nm.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. P680 of Photosystem II oxidizes to P680<sup>+</sup> and transfers to the primary acceptor.

>> ○ The primary acceptor is also called pheophytin.

>> ○ P680<sup>+</sup> is **the strongest oxidizing agent on Earth**.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. P680 has a structure with Mn in the center of pheophytin; oxidized P680<sup>+</sup> oxidizes H<sub>2</sub>O to gain electrons, resulting in O<sub>2</sub> production.

>> ○ Water photolysis occurs inside the thylakoid.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. The electron moved to the first electron acceptor reaches P700 through PQ (plastoquinone), ATP synthase (cytochrome b0f complex, CF<sub>0</sub>CF<sub>1</sub> complex), PC (plastocyanin).

>> ○ In this process, 3H<sup>+</sup> moves, generating 1 ATP.

>> ○ ATP synthase consists of the CF<sub>0</sub> channel, which facilitates the facilitated diffusion of protons, and CF<sub>1</sub>, which contains ATP synthase, creating ATP by chemiosmotic phosphorylation similar to mitochondria's F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>.

<br>

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. P700, having received electrons from ② and ⑤, becomes the excited P700*, which then transfers the electron to the primary electron acceptor.

>> ○ The primary electron acceptor is also known as phylloquinone.

>> ○ P700* is one of **the strongest reductants on Earth**.

> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup>. The electron is transferred from phylloquinone to ferredoxin.

> ⑧ 8<sup>th</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Cyclic photophosphorylation: When the electron moves from ferredoxin to the cytochrome complex. 1 ATP is generated

>> ○ Product: ATP

> ⑨ 8<sup>th</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Non-cyclic photophosphorylation: Ferredoxin transfers the electron to ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup>.

>> ○ Reduction of ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> results in the production of 1 ATP + 1 NADPH.

>> ○ Products: ATP, NADPH, O<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ NADP<sup>+</sup> is the final electron acceptor.

>> ○ Photosystem I inhibitor: Paraquat

>> ○ Photosystem II inhibitor: DCMU

⑹ Dark reactions (Calvin Cycle)

> ① Stroma: The matrix of chloroplasts. **Site of dark reactions**.

>> ○ The reaction synthesizing sugar from glucose takes place in the cytosol.

> ② Calvin Cycle: Uses ATP and NADPH to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> and synthesize carbohydrates (12 NADPH, 18 ATP).

>> ○ Part of the [glucose neosynthesis process](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1413) is proceeded: 3PGA → 1,3-BPG → G3P

**Figure 19.** Calvin Cycle

PGA is 3PG, DPGA is 1,3-BPG, PGAL is G3P

<br>

> ③ Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase)

>> ○ Accounts for 50% of all proteins in leaves, and **the most abundant protein on Earth**.

>> ○ Increased carbon dioxide → carboxylase activity

>> ○ Increased oxygen → oxygenase activity

> ④ G3P: Becomes starch in the stroma or sugar in the cytosol of mesophyll cells.

> ⑤ Dark reaction enzymes function more efficiently under light conditions.

>> ○ Rubisco

>>> ○ Light conditions → Alkalization of stroma → Increase in Rubisco activity

>>> ○ pH changes due to light reactions move Mg<sup>2+</sup> stored in the thylakoid lumen to the stroma → Activates Rubisco.

⑺ C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, and CAM plants

> ① C<sub>3</sub> plants: Common plants (e.g., roses, rice, and most plants in temperate climates)

>> ○ First carbon fixation product: 3-PGA (3C)

>> ○ Reactions at high temperatures

>>> ○ Guard cells: Regulate the opening and closing of stomata and transpiration.

>>> ○ Open stomata: Allows CO<sub>2</sub> intake, but also water loss.

>>> ○ Temperature ↑ → Stomata close → CO<sub>2</sub> deficiency → Decrease in photosynthesis rate

>>> ○ Temperature ↑ → Stomata close → CO<sub>2</sub> deficiency → Excess O<sub>2</sub> leads to photorespiration

> ② Photorespiration

**Figure 20.** Photorespiration

<br>

>> ○ Rubisco can use either CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> as substrates.

>> ○ Rubisco acts as an oxygenase.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. RuBP + O<sub>2</sub> → 3PG + Glycolate (2C)

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. 3PG + Glycolate (2C) + ATP → RuBP + CO<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ Glycolate is decomposed, losing carbon sources.

>> ○ Photorespiration involves chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria.

>> ○ Photorespiration uses energy, so cyclic photophosphorylation is dominant in photorespiratory conditions (high temperature).

>> ○ **Glycine** and **Serine** are involved as intermediates.

> ③ C<sub>4</sub> plants: Tropical and subtropical plants (e.g., corn, sugarcane, sorghum, tropical plants)

>> ○ Lack of Photosystem II: Mesophyll cells have both Photosystems I and II, but bundle-sheath cells only have Photosystem I ([ref](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.67.1.18)).

>> ○ Only cyclic photophosphorylation, low compensation point, spatial separation of carbon fixation.

>> ○ Krantz anatomy: Bundle-sheath cells surround the vascular bundle, and mesophyll cells surround them

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Stomata nearly closed. Mesophyll cells fix carbon to PEP, which has a high affinity for CO<sub>2</sub>.

>>> ○ Mesophyll cells of C<sub>4</sub> plants lack chloroplasts.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. PEP carboxylase binds CO<sub>2</sub> to PEP (3C) to produce oxaloacetate (OAA, 4C). First carbon fixation product.

>>> ○ PEP carboxylase has a higher CO<sub>2</sub> affinity than Rubisco.

>>> ○ PEP carboxylase does not exist in bundle-sheath cells.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Reduced malate (4C) moves to the interior (**bundle-sheath cells**), releasing CO<sub>2</sub>.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Rubisco in bundle sheath cells participates in the Calvin cycle with the supplied carbon dioxide and oxaloacetate in the stroma.

>>> ○ Rubisco does not exist in mesophyll cells.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Malate releasing CO<sub>2</sub> generates NADPH again and produces pyruvate (3C): The reason why photosystem II is unnecessary.

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Pyruvate uses ATP to produce PEP.

>> ○ 7<sup>th</sup>. PEP moves to mesophyll cells.

>> ○ Alternative pathway: Oxaloacetate passes through aspartate instead of malate.

> ④ CAM plants: Plants in extremely hot and dry environments, succulents (e.g., stonecrops, cacti, pineapple, and other desert plants)

>> ○ Photosystem II exists, but its activity decreases under conditions where photorespiration occurs readily ([ref](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.01012/full)).

>> ○ Only cyclic photophosphorylation, low compensation point, carbon fixation **temporally** separated.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. During the day, stomata are completely closed to conserve water. Dark reactions occur but with lower efficiency.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. At night, stomata open to produce malate from CO<sub>2</sub> in the C<sub>4</sub> cycle.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. PEP carboxylase binds CO<sub>2</sub> to PEP to produce oxaloacetate. **The initial carbon fixation product**.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The produced malate is stored in the vacuole.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. During the day, the Calvin cycle operates using CO<sub>2</sub> obtained from the breakdown of malate.

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Malate → CO<sub>2</sub> + NADPH + Pyruvate (3C)

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Pyruvate (3C) is converted to PEP using ATP or utilized in the TCA cycle to produce ATP.

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. CO<sub>2</sub> moves to the stroma to participate in the Calvin cycle with oxaloacetate and Rubisco.

 ⑻ Global warming and photosynthesis

> ① Temperature rise affects the relative proportions and distribution of C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, CAM plants.

> ② Carbon dioxide is being released faster than current photosynthesis can remove.

> ③ 25% of the additional CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is due to deforestation (logging and fires) of tropical forests.
