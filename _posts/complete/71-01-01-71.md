## **1\. DNA and Chromosomes**

⑴ DNA binds to proteins to form a dye (= chromatin) and contains many genes.

> ① Cationic amino acids, such as histidine, condense negatively charged DNA.

> ② Heterochromatin: Condensed chromatin

> ③ Euchromatin: Loose chromatin

⑵ Chromosome: Chromatin condenses into a form that is visible under an optical microscope.

> ① Number of chromosomes = Number of chunks acting as one = Number of chunks that are dyed together

> ② The number of chromosomes is equal to the number of centromeres, except in the case of tetravalent chromosomes.

> ③ The short arm and long arm of a chromosome are referred to as the P arm and Q arm, respectively.

⑶ Karyotype: Refers to the shape, size and number of chromosomes. Species-specific.

<br>

> ① Chemicals are used to halt cells in metaphase during cell division for observation.

⑷ Sister chromatids: Chromatids that are bound together at the centromere after the replication of an unreplicated chromosome.

> ① The number of sister chromosomes is the number of DNA.

> ② Centromere: Possesses a binding site for dynein motor proteins and a kinetochore.

> ③ Bivalent Chromosome (Tetrad): A chromosome containing four sister chromatids.

>> ○ In this case, four sister chromatids are attached to the centromere.

>> ○ Homologous chromosomes do not share centromeres: The reason why the number of chromosomes does not always equal the number of centromeres.

>> ○ 1 bivalent chromosome = 1 tetrad = 2 chromosomes = 4 sister chromatids.

> ④ Univalent Chromosome (Dyad): A chromosome containing two sister chromatids.

>> ○ In this case, two sister chromatids are attached to the centromere.

>> ○ 1 univalent chromosome = 1 dyad = 1 chromosome = 2 sister chromatids.

> ⑤ Nullivalent Chromosome (Monad): A chromosome containing a single chromatid, which corresponds to a double-stranded DNA.

>> ○ This is the form of chromosomes in gametes.

>> ○ 1 nullivalent chromosome = 0 chromosomes = 1 sister chromatid.

⑸ Homologous and sex chromosomes

> ① Homologous chromosome (autosome): Same size, shape, centroid position, relative locus 

> ② Sex chromosome: Different positions, genetic makeup, partial homology

> ③ Example: Humans have 22 pairs of autosomal and 1 pair of sex chromosomes.

> ④ Example: Human germ cells have 22 autosomal and 1 sex chromosomes.

⑹ Proteins involved in cell division 

> ① Condensin: Condenses chromatin into chromosomes

> ② Cohesin: Binds individual chromatids together; during metaphase, cohesin is present only near the centromere.

> ③ Shugoshin: Prevents homologous chromosomes from separating during the first meiotic division.

> ④ Securin: Inhibits separase, preventing the separation of sister chromatids until anaphase.

>> ○ Functions in mitosis, meiosis I, and meiosis II.

>> ○ APC (Anaphase Promoting Complex) inhibits securin.

> ⑤ Separase: Degrades cohesin near the centromere, allowing sister chromatids to separate during anaphase.

>> ○ Functions in mitosis, meiosis I, and meiosis II.

⑺ Mitotic spindle

> ① The spindle fibers are composed of [microtubules](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1409#4-structure-3-broad-meaning-of-cytoskeleton).  

> ② Kinetochore: A protein-bound structure on the centromere where spindle fibers attach.  

> ③ Kinetochore microtubules: Spindle fibers attached to the centromere of a chromosome.  

>> ○ Involved in the movement of chromosomes during anaphase.  

>> ○ Protein involved in microtubule attachment at the kinetochore microtubules: Ndc80

> ④ Polar spindle fibers (nonkinetochore microtubules): Spindle fibers that interact with spindle fibers from the opposite pole, contributing to cell elongation during telophase.

>> ○ Each polar spindle fiber is pushed apart by kinesins, which propel them in opposite directions.  
   
>> ○ Also referred to as interpolar mitotic spindle.  
   
>> ○ Kinesin-5: A pair of motor proteins that move toward the plus end.  
   
>> ○ Kinesin-14: Connects polar spindle fibers and moves toward the minus end.  
   
>> ○ Kinesin-4 and Kinesin-10: Move chromosomes toward the plus end.  

> ⑤ Astral microtubules: Extend toward the cell membrane, aiding in moving centrosomes to the both poles during anaphase.  
   
>> ○ Dynein: A motor protein that moves toward the minus end of astral microtubules.  

> ⑥ Chromosome-arm spindle fibers: Spindle fibers attached to the arms of chromosomes, rotating them to proper orientations during anaphase.  

⑻ Reagent

> ① Giemsa: Stains A-T rich regions on chromosomes with lower binding number, creating banding patterns.  

> ② Acetic acid alcohol: Fixes cells to prevent progression of cell division.

> ③ Hydroxyurea: Synchronizes all cells in the G1 phase. 

> ④ Acridine orange: Causes breaks in double-stranded DNA.  

> ⑤ PHA (Phytohemagglutinin): Converts leukocytes into lymphoblasts, inducing division and differentiation again; used in karyotype analysis.

>> ○ The method of propagation in asexual reproduction.

> ② Meiosis: Germ cell division

>> ○ Division in diploid organisms to produce gametes required for sexual reproduction.

>> ○ The number of chromosomes is halved (reductional division), resulting in haploid (n) daughter cells.

>> ○ The method of propagation in sexual reproduction.

> ③ Number of chromosomes and sister chromosomes (based on meiosis)

## **4. Cell cycle regulation**

⑴ Regulatory proteins controlling the mitotic phase

> ① Cyclin: Its levels fluctuate throughout the cell cycle, and all cyclins associated with a specific stage are degraded once that stage is completed.

>> ○ Degraded by the proteasome.  

> ② CDK (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase): Protein levels remain constant throughout the cell cycle, but activity changes depending on cyclin levels.  

>> ○ CDK1: Regulates the M phase.  

>> ○ CDK2 ~ 8: Regulate the G1 and S phases.  

> ③ MPF (M-phase Promoting Factor)  

>> ○ Refers to CDK1 and cyclin B.

>> ○ Present in the cytoplasm of dividing mammalian cells.  

>> ○ Functions: Chromosome condensation, spindle elongation, and nuclear envelope breakdown.  

>> ○ When spindles attach to kinetochores, APC is activated, which inhibits MPF.  

> ④ CDC (Cell Division Cycle): Substances in yeast that function similarly to MPF.  

>> ○ CDC2: Regulates the M phase.  

>> ○ CDC2 kinase: Regulates the M phase.  

>> ○ Other CDC kinases: Regulate G and S phases.  

>> ○ CDI (CDK Inhibitor): Inhibits CDK activation by acting on CDK.  

> ⑤ APC (Anaphase Promoting Complex)  

>> ○ APC activation during anaphase inhibits securin, thus promotes separase.  

>> ○ Mechanism: APC attaches ubiquitin to securin, leading to the degradation of securin.

>> ○ APC activation inhibits MPF.  

>> ○ When APC is activated, it works with cdc20 to promote the degradation of M cyclin via the proteasome.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>\-2<sup>nd</sup>. Myc → Transcription of Cyclin D and Cyclin E genes.

⑷ G1 Checkpoint Mechanism: Inhibition of S phase transition. p53 is primarily involved.  

> ① Since the G1 phase is the starting point of all cell cycles, multiple inhibitory mechanisms exist.  

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. UV radiation → Mdm protein is removed from p53, converting it to p21.  

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>: p21 inhibits CDK4-Cyclin D and CDK2-Cyclin E, thereby preventing the S phase transition (e.g., inhibition of E2F).  

> ④ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>: If cell damage is severe, p21 activates Bax → Cytochrome C is released into the cytoplasm → Caspase activation → Apoptosis.  

>> ○ Cytochrome C: Involved in the [mitochondrial electron transport chain](https://jb243.github.io/pages/70#3-cellular-respiration) and evolutionarily conserved. Located in the intermembrane space and attached to the inner membrane.  

⑸ S checkpoint mechanism: G1 Cdk inactivates Rb, enabling the S phase to proceed.

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. CDK4-Cyclin D and CDK2-Cyclin E increase the concentration of the transcription factor E2F.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Rb binds to E2F → Cyclin-CDK complexes are inactivated.

>> ○ Rb protein: Suppresses E2F.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Cyclin-CDK complexes use 2 ATP to phosphorylate Rb.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Phosphorylated Rb detaches from E2F.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. E2F translocates to the nucleus → Promotes the synthesis of Cyclin A.

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. CDK2 binds with Cyclin A → Acts as a transcription factor to complete the S phase and transcribe the Cyclin B gene.

⑹ G2 checkpoint mechanism (yeast)

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. CDK1 binds with Cyclin B (M Cyclin) to form an inactive Cyclin-CDK complex.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. The Cyclin-CDK complex is phosphorylated and inhibited by WEE1.

>> ○ WEE1: A type of kinase.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The complex is phosphorylated and activated by CAK (CDK Activating Kinase), but its activity is suppressed by WEE1.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. CDC25 removes the phosphate group from the Cyclin-CDK complex, allowing the activation of cyclin-CDK complex by CAK.

>> ○ CDC25: A type of phosphatase.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. The activated Cyclin-CDK complex further activates CDC25 and inactivates WEE1.

⑶ **Type 1.** Point Mutations: Gene-level mutations

> ① Base substitution mutations

>> ○ Definition: Mutations caused by the replacement of one base of DNA with another.

>> ○ Classification based on phenotype

>>> ○ Silent mutation: Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, a base substitution does not alter the encoded amino acid, resulting in no change in phenotype.

>>> ○ Missense mutation: Base substitution changes the codon to encode a different amino acid.

>>> ○ Nonsense mutation: Codon changes to a stop codon, resulting in premature termination.

>>> ○ Neutral mutation: Changes to a similar amino acid with no significant phenotypic change.

>>> ○ Mutations preventing transcription termination.

>>> ○ Translation of stop codon into a meaningful amino acid, potentially elongating the protein.

>>> ○ Point mutations in non-coding regions of DNA: Reduces splicing efficiency of introns.

>>> ○ Mutations in promoters: Prevent transcription.

>> ○ Types of base substitution mutations

>>> ○ Transversion mutation: A mutation where a purine is replaced by a pyrimidine, or a pyrimidine is replaced by a purine.

>>> ○ Transition mutations are less likely to result in amino acid changes and have a higher probability of reverting to the original state through an additional mutation at the same site.

> ③ Reversion mutations

>> ○ Reapplication of the same mutagen restores normal offspring from mutated organisms.

>> ○ Typically limited to base substitution mutations.

⑷ **Type 2.** Chromosomal mutations

> ① Deletion

>> ○ Deletion loop: Used in creating [genome maps](https://jb243.github.io/pages/75).

>> ○ Nearby genes are often deleted together.

> ② Duplication

>> ○ Compensation loop

> ③ Inversion

>> ○ Pericentric inversion: Results in 100% normal chromosomes.

> ④ Translocation

>> ○ Reciprocal translocation: Exchange of genetic material between two chromosomes, forming a cross-shaped translocation.

>>> ○ [Holliday Model](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1460)

>>> ○ Example: Chromosome 8 → Chromosome 14

>> ○ Non-reciprocal translocation: Genetic material is transferred unidirectionally from one chromosome to another.

>> ○ **Example 1.** Robertsonian translocation: Causes familial Down syndrome.

>>> ○ Found in 1/1000 births.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Long arms of chromosomes 14 and 21 fuse: (14, 14), (21, 21) → (14, 14-21), (21, ×)

>>>> ○ The centromere in 14-21 is derived from chromosome 14, so it behaves like chromosome 14.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Short arms of chromosomes 14 and 21 are lost.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Gametes: <span>(14, 21) || (14, ×) || (14-21, 21) || (14-21, ×)</span>

**Figure 8.** Non-disjunction Process

<br>

>> ○ Non-disjunction in Meiosis I: (n+1, n+1, n-1, n-1). No normal gametes. No duplicated genes in all gametes.

>> ○ Non-disjunction in Meiosis II: (n+1, n-1, n, n). 50% normal gametes. Duplicated genes present in n+1 gametes.

> ② Autosomal aneuploidy: Gain or loss of one or two chromosomes.

>> ○ Nullisomy: Loss of a homologous pair; lethal before implantation.

>> ○ Monosomy: Loss of a single chromosome; embryonic lethal.

>> ○ Trisomy: Embryonic or fetal lethal.

>> ○ Patau syndrome (Trisomy of chromosome 13)

>> ○ Edward syndrome (Trisomy of chromosome 18)

>> ○ Down syndrome (Trisomy of chromosome 21): Occurs in 1/750 births; characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, short stature, heart defects, shorter lifespan, and susceptibility to respiratory diseases. Frequency increases with maternal age.

>> ○ Haplo IV: Chromosome 4 deletion in Drosophila

> ③ Sex chromosomal aneuploidy: Having one or two extra or missing chromosomes. The effects are not severe, and normal lifespan is maintained.

>> ○ Reason: The Y chromosome contains a small amount of genetic information, and only one X chromosome is active (the other forms a Barr body).

>> ○ XXX (Triple X syndrome): 1/1000 births; normal phenotype with slightly increased risk of intellectual disability.

>> ○ XYY (Double Y syndrome): 1/2000 births; tendency for tall stature, normal phenotype with mild intellectual disability, predisposition to petty thief.

>> ○ XXY, XXXY (Klinefelter syndrome): 1/2000 births; males with tall stature, sexual immaturity, small testes, infertility, and intellectual disability.

>> ○ XO (Turner syndrome): 1/5000 births; 99% spontaneous abortion; short stature and incomplete sexual maturation.

>> ○ XYY, XYYY (Jacob's syndrome)

> ④ Polyploidy: A mutation where the number of chromosomes increases as a multiple of n.

>> ○ Autopolyploidy: Occurs when a 2n (plant) organism becomes 4n, then reproduces with a 2n organism of the same species to produce a 3n organism.  

>>> ○ Colchicine: A spindle fiber polymerization inhibitor that binds to tubulin dimers, halting cell division at metaphase. 

>>> ○ Colchicine is frequently used to induce autopolyploidy for crop improvement purposes.  

>>> ○ Taxol: A spindle fiber depolymerization inhibitor used as an anticancer drug.

>> ○ Allopolyploidy: Polyploidy resulting from hybridization between closely related species (plants).

>>> ○ Mechanism of evolution.  

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. An AB organism is formed through hybridization between an AA organism and a BB organism.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. If the AB organism has an odd number of chromosomes, it is infertile. Fertility is restored through polyploidy, resulting in an AABB organism.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Fertile AABB organisms reproduce to create more fertile AABB organisms.  

>> ○ **Example 1.** Seedless watermelon (3n).  

>> ○ **Example 2.** Triploids (3n) occur in 1–3% of all pregnancies → Most are not viable for birth or survival.

## **6. Cancer**

⑴ Definition

> ① Tumor: A mass of non-functional cells formed through uncontrolled cell division.

> ② Benign tumor: A tumor that does not invade surrounding tissues (≠ cancer).

> ③ Malignant tumor: A tumor that invades surrounding tissues (cancer).

> ④ Metastasis: When cancer cells spread and form new tumors in other locations.

> ⑤ Normal cells → Potential tumor cells (divide without signals) → Benign tumor → Malignant tumor → Metastasis

> ⑥ Oncology: The study of cancer.

⑵ Characteristics of cancer cells

> ① Normal cells

>> ○ Divide in response to signals and survive only as long as necessary.

>> ○ Perform specialized differentiation.

>> ○ Remain in their designated location due to cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Movement and invasion into other areas are prohibited.

> ② Cancer cells

>> ○ Lose normal regulatory functions due to genetic mutations, exhibiting abnormal behavior.

>> ○ **Step 1.** Unlimited division potential → Benign tumor

>>> ○ Cancer cells have significantly larger nuclei compared to normal cells.

>> ○ **Step 2.** Invasion to other cell territories → Metastasis

>>> ○ Spread through lymphatic or blood vessels to other parts of the body.

>>> ○ Cancer as small as 2–3 mm can metastasize.

>> ○ **Step 3.** Formation of secondary tumors → Malignant tumor

>> ○ **Step 4.** Metastatic cancer cells circulate throughout the body via the circulatory or lymphatic systems.

> ③ Distribution of cancer cells

>> ○ 4–5% of cancer cells are stem cells.

>> ○ Normal immune systems can destroy up to 10 million tumor cells.

>> ○ Clinically detectable cancer contains at least 1 billion tumor cells.

⑶ Characteristics of Cancerous Tissues

>> ○ Takes 5–10 years for cancer tissue to grow to 5 mm.

>> ○ Faster cancer growth in younger patients.

> ② **Feature 1.** Angiogenesis begins when cancer tissue exceeds 2 mm<sup>3</sup>.

> ③ **Feature 2.** Cancer tissues are more acidic (pH ≤ 7.2) than normal tissues (pH 7.4) due to active glycolysis.

> ④ **Feature 3.** Cancer tissues are slightly warmer than normal tissues due to inefficient heat dissipation from poorly formed blood vessels.

> ⑤ **Feature 4.** Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis): Increased glycolysis and lactate production in cancer cells regardless of oxygen levels.

> ⑥ **Feature 5.** Metastasis: Cancer cells lose intercellular adhesion due to reduced expression of E/P-Cadherin, ultimately leading to increased metastasis.

> ⑦ **Feature 6.** Hypercalcemia: Elevated blood calcium levels causing lethargy due to sodium channel closure.

⑷ Causes of cancer

> ① Cancer risk factors: Factors that increase the likelihood of cancer development. Approximately 80-90% of all cancers are caused by lifestyle and environmental factors.

>> ○ Smoking: Cigarettes contain various carcinogens and increase the production of free radicals, leading to DNA damage.

>> ○ High-fat, low-fiber diet: Poor dietary habits contribute to cancer risk.  

>> ○ Lack of exercise: Weakens the immune system and increases the risk of cancer associated with obesity.  

>> ○ Alcohol consumption: Alcohol combined with smoking multiplies cancer risk.  

>> ○ Aging: The immune system deteriorates, and mutations accumulate over time.  

>> ○ Frequent cell division: Leads to an increased chance of mutations.  

>>> ○ Damage from ovarian ovulation and subsequent repair processes.  

>>> ○ Damage from epithelial movement in the digestive tract and its repair.  

>> ○ Exposure to radiation and high-voltage lines: Increases the frequency of cancers such as leukemia.

>>> ○ Plays a key role in MAPK activation.

>>> ○ Normal function: Regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

>>> ○ Types of Ras include H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras.

>>> ○ Loss of GTPase-activating protein function or accumulation of degradation-resistant proteins leads to excessive Ras activation.

>>> ○ This results in growth factor-independent cell division, leading to transformation into cancer cells.

>>> ○ Most cases of growth factor-independent cell division in cancer are caused by Ras.

>> **○ Example 7.** myc

> ③ **Gene Group 2.** Oncogenes: Mutations in proto-oncogenes cause DNA alterations.

>> ○ When a proto-oncogene mutates into an oncogene, it excessively promotes cell division even in the absence of growth factors.  

>> ○ **Mechanism 1.** Hyperactivation due to structural or functional changes in encoded proteins caused by DNA base mutations.  

>> ○ **Mechanism 2.** Overexpression due to gene rearrangement (e.g., when a gene is positioned directly in front of a promoter).  

>> ○ **Mechanism 3.** Overexpression caused by an increase in the copy number of gene.  

>> ○ **Example 1.** When a mutation occurs in a proto-oncogene.

⑺ Treatment methods

> ① Overview

>> ○ Easily treatable cancers: Thyroid cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer

>> ○ Difficult-to-treat cancers: Pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, brain cancer

> ② **Method 1.** Surgery: Localized tumors can often be removed surgically.

> ③ **Method 2.** Chemotherapy: Uses anticancer drugs to kill dividing cells.

>> ○ Cocktail therapy: A combination of various cell division-inhibiting chemotherapy drugs.  

>> ○ Resistant cells: Occur at a rate of 1 in 1 million cells. In palpable tumors, approximately 1,000 resistant cells are present.  

>> ○ Side effects: Kills normally dividing cells (all cells, including those in the bone marrow and stomach wall), leading to side effects such as hair loss, vomiting, and diarrhea.  

>> ○ TNBC (Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells)  
  
>>> ○ Breast cancer cells that do not express estrogen, progesterone, or epithelial growth factors.  

>>> ○ Among epithelial growth factors, particularly ERBB2 (Her2/neu) is important.  

>>> ○ Accounts for 10-20% of all breast cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S.  

>>> ○ Lack of expression of these three receptors reduces the effectiveness of hormone-based therapies (e.g., Tamoxifen) and receptor-targeted therapies (e.g., Herceptin).  

>> ○ **Example 1.** Standard pancreatic cancer treatment: nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine  

> ④ **Method 3.** Radiation Therapy: Uses high-energy radiation.

>> ○ Mechanism: Damages DNA to induce cancer cell death (e.g., BRCA2, p53).

>> ○ Typically used for cancers located nearby.

>> ○ Generally involves 10-20 sessions of radiation therapy after surgically removing the tumor.

>> ○ Effects on normal cells: Normal cells undergo normal cell division (via p53 and DNA repair) or apoptosis.

>> ○ Effects on tumor cells: Results in cell death due to increased mutations or further malignancy progression.

>> ○ **Example 1.** Standard prostate cancer treatment: PSMA-targeting radionuclide.

> ⑤ Standard treatment methods by cancer type

>> ○ Thyroid cancer: Surgery or I-131 is the primary treatment.  

>> ○ Skin cancer: Typically treated with cryo-surgery.  

>> ○ Blood cancer: Among blood cancer antigens, CD19 is the most commonly targeted.  

>> ○ Solid tumors: No established treatment methods known to date. The most commonly targeted antigen in solid tumors is TAA (tumor-associated antigen).  

>> ○ Glioblastoma: Difficult to treat due to unclear boundaries with normal tissue. No established treatment methods known to date.  

>> ○ Lymphoma: Generally treated with chemotherapy.  

⑻ [Cancer Statistics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/730): In 2015, cancer caused 8.8 million deaths worldwide.
