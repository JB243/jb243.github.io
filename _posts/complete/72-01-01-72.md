⑵ Classical hypothesis about the relationship between genes and chromosomes

> ① Sutton's Chromosome Theory: Genes are small particles in the chromosome.

> ② Morgan's Chromosome Theory: Allele is at the same locus on the gene.

⑶ Classical experiment that identified DNA as a genetic material  

> ① Transformation experiment

>> ○ Griffith experiment: R-type bacteria are transformed into S-type.

>> ○ Avery experiment: Advances Griffith's experiment and reveals that DNA is the material that causes transformation.

> ② Hershey and Chase Experiment

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Bacteriophage are labeled with radioactive isotopes: <sup>32</sup>P for DNA labeling, <sup>35</sup>S for protein labeling.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Infect the E. coli and culture it.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Use a blender to separate the E. coli from the phages.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Use centrifugation to separate the nuclei and the rest.

>> ○ Composition of DNA: C, H, O, N, P

>> ○ Composition of proteins: C, H, O, N, S

>> ○ Demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material using E. coli and T2 phages.

>> ○ E. coli and T2 phages have significant size differences, making separation possible.

> ③ Additional evidence that DNA is genetic material  

>> ○ Chargaff's rules: [A] = [T], [G] = [C] (proven by paper-chromatography)

>> ○ The amount of DNA in all somatic cells of an individual is the same.

>> ○ DNA amount fluctuates during cell division.

>> ○ Highest mutation rate for light at 260 nm (DNA maximum absorption wavelength). No mutation at 280 nm.

⑷ Amount of DNA

> ① One chromosome consists of one DNA.

> ② One chromosome consists of 10<sup>7</sup> - 10<sup>10</sup> bp.

> ③ Total amount of DNA consists of 3 × 10<sup>9</sup> bp.

⑸ Gene: DNA sequence that encodes a protein and is transcribed into mRNA.

> ① Full length of the human genome = 3 billion base pairs

> ② About 30,000 genes in the human genome. Total length of genes = 50 million base pair

> ③ 10<sup>3</sup> -10<sup>6</sup> bp for each gene

> ④ Allele: Different genes with different sequences at the same locus on DNA.

> ⑤ Siblings on average share about 50% of allele.

> ⑥ Reason: This is because the probability of a given gene matching either the paternal or maternal side is 50%.

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Mendel Genetics**

⑴ Genotypes and Phenotypes

> ① Character: Features that differ between individuals (_e.g._, Color).

> ② Allelic character: Characters that can be clearly contrasted with each other among traits (e.g., The shape is more clearly defined as round in contrast to wrinkled.)

> ③ Trait (phenotype): Type of character represented by an individual (e.g., Purple, Red)

>> ○ Wild type (wt), mutant (mt), dominant trait, recessive trait  

> ④ Genotype: Type of gene an individual has.

>> ○ Homozygote: The case that both allele are the same (e.g., AA, BB, OO)

>> ○ Heterozygote: The case that two alleles are different (e.g., AB, AO)

> ⑤ Recessive trait: Phenotypes of allele only in homozygotes (e.g., OO)

> ⑥ Dominant trait: Phenotypes that also appear in heterozygotes (e.g., AA, AO; BO, BB)

> ⑦ Carrier: Heterozygote for recessive disease

> ⑧ Mating

>> ○ Unisexual mating (e.g., Aa), bisexual mating (e.g., AaBb)

>> ○ Self-pollination (↔ Cross pollination): Breeding between individuals with the same genotype, often used for improving a breed.

>> ○ Testcross: By mating an individual with a homozygous recessive individual, the genotype can be determined.

>> ○ Reciprocal cross: Breeding a maternal line with the father's genotype and a paternal line with the mother's genotype. This can determine whether there is sex-linked inheritance.

>> ○ p generation, F<sub>1</sub> generation (hybrid first generation), F<sub>2</sub> generation (hybrid second generation)

⑵ Mendel's law

> ① Mendelian traits: Traits for which the pattern of inheritance can be easily determined, as in Mendel's experiments.

> ② Plant hybrid research (1860s): Study on the inheritance of seven allelic traits in peas, with clear dominance and recessiveness.

>> ○ Shell of peas: Round gray, Wrinkled white

>>> ○ An allele encodes an enzyme called SBE (starch branching enzyme), which is related to amylopectin.

>>> ○ Wrinkled peas have higher osmotic pressure: they become wrinkled when they absorb water and swell, then dry.

>> ○ Color of peas: Yellow, Green

>> ○ Color of flowers: White, Purple (Red)

>> ○ Shape of pods: Smooth pods, Creased pods

>> ○ Color of pods: Yellow, Green

>> ○ The place where flowers bloom: Between the branches, or at the top.

>> ○ Stem size: Big, Small

> ③ Advantages of peas

>> ○ Peas have a short generation (3 months).

>> ○ Pea leaves a lot of offspring.

>> ○ Pea is easy to grow and easy to control reproduction.

>> ○ Peas are capable of both self-fertilization and cross-fertilization.

>> ○ Pea traits and dominance/recessiveness are very clear.

>> ○ Although the alleles are linked and positioned far apart, they seem to adhere to the law of independence.

> ④ Highlights the design of experiments and the importance of mathematical thinking (statistics) of results.

>> ○ Mendel conducts testcross to determine if an individual is true-breeding.

> ⑤ Mendel's law

>> ○ Several types of allele are used to determine traits.

>> ○ **The Law of Dominance:** When pure lines with opposing traits are crossed, only one of the parent's traits appears in the F<sub>1</sub> generation.

>>> ○ This means that in a heterozygous individual, only one allele's trait is expressed.

>>> ○ The trait that appears in heterozygotes is dominant, while the other is recessive.

>>> ○ This contrasts with the blending inheritance hypothesis.

>> ○ **The Law of Segregation:** Since reproductive cells contain half the genetic material, only one of the two alleles is passed on.

>>> ○ An individual inherits only two alleles, one from each parent.

>>> ○ The forked line method can be applied.

>> ○ **The Law of Independence:** Genes that are not in an allelic relationship are assumed to assort independently during gamete formation. Doesn't consider linkage along the same chromosome.

>>> ○ A 9:3:3:1 ratio in the case of A_B_ : aaB_ : A_bb : aabb suggests independence.

<br>

⑸ Complementary Test (Cis-Trans Test)

> ① Definition: It is a test to determine whether certain genes related to a specific mutant trait are the same gene or different genes.

> ② Example: In the example below, there are a total of three mutant genes: Gene 1 (= Gene 3 = Gene 5), Gene 2, and Gene 4.

⑹ Hereditary diseases

> ① Achondroplasia

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Linkage and Cross**

⑴ Drosophila research

> ① Theoretical formulation of the linkage is made by studying fruit flies, starting with Morgan.

> ② Benefits of Drosophila as a Genetic Study

>> ○ Readily available.

>> ○ Breeding is easy and does not harm person.

>> ○ Breeds a lot and breeds every 2 weeks.

>> ○ Small number of chromosomes: 4 pairs of chromosomes.  

⑵ Linkage

> ① Two or more non-alleles exist on the same chromosome and behave identically.

> ② Man has 23 linkage groups.

> ③ Cis-configuration and Trans-configuration  

>> ○ Cis-configuration (coupling): Individuals with AB and ab chromosomes

>> ○ Trans-configuration (repulsion): Individuals with Ab and aB Chromosomes

>> ○ When doing cross experiments, you should first determine whether you are based on cis-configuration or trans-configuration.

>> ○ **Case 1.** Cis-configuration AaBb × Cis-configuration AaBb

>>> ○ The probability that the offspring have the same genotype as the parents is 1/2: <span>(AB | ab) → (AB | ab)</span>

>>> ○ There are 2 types of phenotypes in the offspring: A_B_, aabb

>> ○ **Case 2.** Trans-configuration AaBb × Trans-configuration AaBb

>>> ○ The probability that the offspring have the same genotype as the parents is 1/2: <span>(Ab | aB) → (Ab | aB)</span>

>>> ○ There are 3 types of phenotypes in the offspring: A_B_, A_bb, aaB_ 

>> ○ **Case 3.** Cis-configuration AaBb × Trans-configuration AaBb

>>> ○ There are 3 types of phenotypes in the offspring: A_B_, A_bb, aaB_

>> ○ In **Cases 1** to **3**, A is dominant over a, and B is dominant over b.

>> ○ [Example problem](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1394)

> ④ Complete linkage and incomplete linkage

>> ○ Complete linkage: Linkage that produces only parent type. If two genes are very close and have fewer offspring.

>>> ○ In other words, when there is 100% genetic linkage.

>>> ○ A_B_ : aaB_ : A_bb : aabb = 3:0:0:1 means cis-configuration complete linkage.

>>> ○ A_B_ : aaB_ : A_bb : aabb = 2:1:1:0 means trans-configuration complete linkage.

>> ○ Incomplete linkage: Produces both parental and recombinant (crossover) traits.

⑶ Crossover

> ① Exchange between sister chromatid segments occurs when bivalent chromosomes (tetrad) are formed during the prophase of the first meiotic division.

>> ○ First-Division Segregation (FDS): When there is no crossing over

>> ○ Second-Division Segregation (SDS): When there is crossing over
   
>> ○ Chiasma: The location where crossing over occurs. The number of chiasmata is proportional to chromosome length.

> ② The recombination rate is proportional to the distance between two linked genes.

> ③ **Formula 1:** Crossover rate = (Number of gametes where crossing over occurs ÷ Total number of gametes) × 100

> ④ **Formula 2:** Crossover rate = (Number of offspring resulting from crossing over in a test cross ÷ Total number of offspring obtained in a test cross) × 100

> ⑤ Multiple crossovers: The probability of multiple crossovers is theoretically equal to the product of the probabilities of each individual single crossover.

>> ○ 1-2 crossover events typically occur for each chromosomal pair in each gamete.

> ⑥ The crossover rate is a maximum of 50%: When the distance between two genes is very large, they satisfy the law of independence, and in the case of independence, the crossover rate is 50%.

> ⑦ Issues with calculating crossover rate

>> ○ If an even number of crossovers occur between two linked genes, they do not contribute to the crossover rate.

>> ○ Interference: One crossover event can inhibit (negative interference, most commonly) or promote (positive interference) another crossover event.

>> ○ As the distance between two genes increases, the crossover rate becomes less accurate.

>> ○ In most cases, an equal and equivalent amount of DNA is exchanged. However, unequal crossover can result in copy number variants (CNVs) as well as inversions and translocations.

>> ○ Crossover is non-random; over 25,000 small regions of elevated recombination have been characterized as recombination hotspots.

⑷ Gene map

> ① A plot of the location of genes on a chromosome based on crossover rates obtained by three-point test crosses.

>> ○ Test cross: A cross between an individual that is heterozygous for all genes and a homozygous recessive individual.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Group the 8 organisms into pairs.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The majority of pairs will display the parental type.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. At least one pair of individuals contains the gene located in the middle on the map: Using the double crossover rate

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Calculate the crossover rate between the intermediate gene and each of the other genes to estimate map distance of genes.

> ② 1 cM (centi-Morgan): A map distance where the crossover rate is 1%.

> ③ Double crossovers

>> ○ For values below 25 cM, there is an almost proportional relationship between recombination frequency and map distance.  

>> ○ For values above 25 cM, the crossover rate appears lower compared to the map distance.  

>> ○ Reason: This is due to the occurrence of double crossovers. In each gamete, typically 1–2 crossovers occur per chromosome.  

>> ○ Application: The crossover rate between the two most distant genes is smaller than the sum of the distances between the respective intermediate genes.  

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Non-Mendel Genetics**

⑴ Co-dominance: Both alleles are expressed as phenotypes.

> ① MN blood type

> ② ABO blood type: I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> are co-dominant. i is recessive.

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cFna3c/btrzX0e37xg/yGs9ZWmhVdajgwytxdQ5lk/img.png" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 5.</b> ABO blood type inheritance 

<br>

>> ○ The gene encoding the glycoprotein on the surface of red blood cells located on chromosome 19.

>> ○ AB type: I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup>

>> ○ A type: I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup> or I<sup>A</sup>i

>> ○ B type: I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup> or I<sup>B</sup>i

>> ○ O type: ii

⑵ Incomplete dominance (intermediate inheritance)

> ① A complete phenotype is expressed only in homozygotes, while the phenotype of heterozygotes is intermediate.

> ② Quantitative inheritance: Usually pigments, receptors (e.g., Inheritance of hypercholesterolemia and LDL receptors)

> ③ Flower color of snapdragon: Rr × Rr

>> ○ RR : Rr : rr = Red : Pink : White = 1:2:1

>> ○ **Tip:** The inheritance of color is not a common dominant but an incomplete dominant.

⑶ Multiple allele inheritance: A case where more than three alleles exist at a single gene locus, often originating from mutations.

> ① The ABO blood type gene is determined by three alleles (multiple alleles).

⑷ Pleiotropy: The effect of a single allele influencing two or more phenotypes.

> ① Cystic fibrosis (CF): Recessive genetic disease

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. A defect in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Mutations occur in channels that transport chlorine ions out of epithelial cells.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Excessive chloride ions are secreted, causing a significant amount of water to be released outside the epithelial cells.

>> ○ Symptom: Accumulation of thick mucus, repeated lung infections, digestive problems, impaired liver function, shortened lifespan

>> ○ Among white Americans, it occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500 individuals.  

>> ○ Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections are a major cause of death in CF patients.

> ② Hemophilia(factor Ⅶ): Excessive bleeding, bruising, joint pain and swelling, loss of vision, etc.

> ③ Sickle cell anemia

>> ○ Definition: A disease caused by the substitution of the 6th amino acid in the β-chain of hemoglobin from glutamic acid (Glu, hydrophilic) to valine (Val, hydrophobic).

>>> ○ N terminal - Val - His - Leu - Thr - Pro - **Glu/Val** - Glu - ···

>> ○ Types of hemoglobin variants: Approximately 500 Types

>>> ○ Most are caused by the substitution of a single amino acid in the globin polypeptide chain.

>>> ○ **Example 1.** HbS (sickle-cell Hb): Substitution of a single Glu with Val on the surface.

>>> ○ **Example 2.** Hb Cowtown: Removal of an ion pair involved in T-state stabilization.

>>> ○ **Example 3.** Hb Memphis: Substitution of a similar-sized residue on the surface with a polar but uncharged residue. Nearly a neutral mutation.

>>> ○ **Example 4.** Hb Bibba: Substitution of one Leu with Pro, affecting the α-helix.

>>> ○ **Example 5.** Hb Milwaukee: Substitution of one Val with Glu.

>>> ○ **Example 6.** Hb Providence: One Lysine (Lys) that normally sticks out at the center of the tetramer is replaced with Asparagine (Asn). This decreases BPG binding and increases oxygen saturation.

>>> ○ **Example 7.** Hb Philly: One Tyrosine (Tyr) is replaced with Phenylalanine (Phe), breaking a hydrogen bond at the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>1</sub> junction site. This increases BPG binding and decreases oxygen saturation.

>> ○ Mechanism: When a hydrophilic amino acid is replaced with a hydrophobic amino acid, huge structural changes occur.

>>> ○ Clumping (fibrosis) of mutant hemoglobin: Due to hydrophobic interactions, hemoglobin molecules stick together and form fibers.

>>> ○ The formation of fibers is the reason why hemoglobin takes on a sickle shape.

>>> ○ The same genetic mutation is not observed in myoglobin: This is because myoglobin functions as a single monomer.

>> ○ Trait based on genetic type

>>> ○ Dominant homozygous: Normal red blood cells.

>>> ○ Recessive homozygotes: Sickle-shaped red blood cells, significantly increased resistance to malaria (↑↑), but severely reduced oxygen transport efficiency (↓↓).  

>>> ○ Heterozygotes: Some red blood cells are sickle-shaped, increased resistance to malaria (↑), and slightly reduced oxygen transport efficiency (↓).  

>> ○ Symptoms: Rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, dementia, weakened immunity, stroke, and heart weakness.

>> ○ Treatment: Currently, there is no cure for sickle cell anemia, but bone marrow transplantation can help improve symptoms.

> ④ Tay-Sachs disease: Autosomal recessive disease

>> ○ Lipid metabolism disease caused by hexoseaminidase A deficiency.

>> ○ It manifests in newborns and typically leads to death around the age of 3.

> ⑤ Phenylketonuria (PKU): Autosomal recessive diseases

>> ○ Definition: A disorder where PAH (Phenylalanine Hydroxylase) cannot be synthesized.

>>> ○ PAH (Phenylalanine Hydroxylase): An enzyme that hydroxylates phenylalanine into tyrosine.

>>> ○ Tyrosine: Essential for the production of thyroxine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and melanin.

>> ○ Phenylalanine accumulates in the blood and is eventually excreted in the urine, producing dark-colored urine.

>>> ○ Converts to phenylpyruvic acid, causing acidosis, neural tube developmental disorders, intellectual disability, and pale skin.

>>> ○ Around 3 to 5 months of age, infants show indifference and do not respond to their environment.

>>> ○ By the age of 1, significant intellectual decline becomes noticeable: Even in adulthood, the IQ often remains below 50.

>> ○ Diagnosis: Phenylpyruvic acid, a kind of phenylketone, in the urine are detected using ferric chloride, turning green (normal individuals show a brown color).

>> ○ Treatment: If a newborn consumes a low-phenylalanine diet from early infancy, normal nervous system development can be achieved.

⑸ Polygenic inheritance: A single phenotype is influenced by two or more genes (loci), leading to quantitative traits.

> ① It is distinguished from multiple alleles inheritance in that it pertains to a single phenotype.

> ② Skin color, eye color: Multiple melanin-synthesizing enzymes (e.g., tyrosinase) + transport proteins → Melanin content

>> ○ Melanin is a dark brown pigment made from tyrosine.

>> ○ Tyrosinase deficiency leads to albinism.

> ③ At least three genes determine height.

>> ○ When F1 offspring (AaBbCc) resulting from a cross between AABBCC × aabbcc are self-crossed, a normal distribution is observed.

>> ○ Normal distribution: <sub>6</sub>C<sub>0</sub> : <sub>6</sub>C<sub>1</sub> : <sub>6</sub>C<sub>2</sub> : <sub>6</sub>C<sub>3</sub> : <sub>6</sub>C<sub>4</sub> : <sub>6</sub>C<sub>5</sub> : <sub>6</sub>C<sub>6</sub>

> ④ cis AB type

>> ○ When a mutation causes the A gene and the B gene to exist at different loci on the same chromosome.

>> ○ O children can be born from AB parents.

⑹ Epistasis: When one gene influences or affects the phenotype of another gene.

> ① Fur color 9:3:4

>> ○ Pigment gene and pigment precipitation gene are involved.

>> ○ In the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the pigment deposition gene combines the 3 and 1 categories (i.e., recessive homozygous for that gene) into 4.

>> ○ **Tip.** If 12:3:1, 9:6:1, 9:3:4, or 9:7 is observed in any experiment, it is the case of epistasis.

> ② Complementary genes: Non-allelic genes that work together to express a single trait.

> ③ Bombay O phenotype

>> ○ H gene: A gene that attaches a fucose sugar to the surface of red blood cells to determine blood types.

>> ○ When the H gene is recessive homozygous, an O blood type child can be born even in combinations where an O blood type child is not normally possible. In other words, the H gene locus is epistatic to the I gene locus.

>> ○ H gene is on chromosome 19.

>> ○ ABO allele is present on chromosome 9.

> ④ Double recessive gene: 9:3:3:1 becomes 15:1.

⑺ Recessive lethal: The condition often manifests at a young age.

> ① In the case of AB × AB, the offspring are AA, AB, BA, and BB, but if BB is lethal, only AA, AB, and BA are observed.

> ○ If A is dominant over B, the ratio of A trait to B trait is 1:0.

> ○ If A is recessive to B, the ratio of A trait to B trait is 1:2.

> ② Example: Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, albinism, Tay-Sachs disease, etc.

⑻ Dominant lethal: The condition often manifests later in life.

> ① Genotypes and traits

> ② Example: Huntingtons' disease

>> ○ It occurs at 30-40 years old, so it can be easily inherited.

>> ○ A progressive incurable condition characterized by the death of brain nerve cells, cognitive decline, central nervous system disorders, and symptoms of chorea.

>> ○ Died 10-20 years after onset of a physiological disorder.

>> ○ HD gene on chromosome 4: Encodes a 3114 amino acid protein → Accumulates in the nuclei of brain cells, forming toxic protein aggregates, leading to neuronal death.  

>> ○ 5'-CAG repeat sequence: Promotes the detachment of RNA polymerase.  

>> ○ 5'-CAG repeated 9-36 times: Normal.  

>> ○ 5'-CAG repeated 37-66 times: Encodes polyQ (polyglutamine). Onset occurs at age 40 with 40 repeats.

>> ○ 5'-CAG repeated 33-36 times: Premutation, with a high likelihood of expansion in offspring.

>> ○ 5'-CAG repeated over 100 times: Onset at age 2.  

>> ○ Genetic anticipation: As generations progress, the number of repeats increases, leading to a higher likelihood of disease onset.

> ③ Incomplete dominant lethal: When heterozygotes do not result in death but exhibit severe or fatal symptoms, such as deformities.  

>> ○ Example: Achondroplasia

⑼ Genomic imprinting and extranuclear inheritance

> ① Genomic imprinting 

>> ○ Phenomenon where the expression of a trait differs depending on whether it is inherited from the mother or the father.

>> ○ Occurs due to DNA methylation (methylation of C nucleotides): Influenced primarily by the methylation of CpG islands.

>> ○ In all genes during gametogenesis, methylation is erased and re-established according to whether the gene comes from a paternal or maternal origin.

>> ○ A male individual, who is heterozygous and carries a recessive trait due to maternal imprinting, may exhibit a dominant trait because of paternal imprinting.

>>> ○ Example: Igf-1 gene in mice

>> ○ **Example 1.** Igf-1 gene in mice

>>> ○ Paternal imprinting: Methylation of the insulator → Activates transcription.

>>> ○ Maternal imprinting: Methylation of the promoter → Suppresses transcription.

>> ○ **Example 2.** Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome

>>> ○ Common feature: A recessive trait caused by the suppression of specific gene expression due to chromosomal deletion and genomic imprinting.

>>> ○ Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)

>>>> ○ Deletion of paternal chromosome 15 

>>>> ○ The non-deleted region of the maternal chromosome is imprinted through methylation, resulting in the suppression of the PWS gene.

>>> ○ Angelman syndrome (AS)

>>>> ○ Deletion of maternal chromosome 15

>>>> ○ Known as the "happy puppet syndrome" due to characteristic laughter and smiling.

>>>> ○ The non-deleted region of the paternal chromosome is imprinted through methylation, resulting in the suppression of the AS gene.

> ② Maternal effect: Cytoplasmic determinants

>> ○ Proteins required in the early stages of development are delivered as mRNA from the mother, as there is not enough time for transcription.

>> ○ Regardless of the genotype of the germ cells, if the mother has at least one allele, the corresponding cytoplasmic determinant is delivered to the germ cells.  

>> ○ Genotype and phenotype must be considered separately.  

>>> ○ Example: There are cases where individuals homozygous for a recessive lethal gene can survive but are unable to reproduce.

>> ○ The mother's genotype must be inferred from the offspring's phenotype.  

>>> ○ If all offspring exhibit the dominant trait, the mother's genotype is dominant.  

>>> ○ If all offspring exhibit the recessive trait, the mother's genotype is recessive.  

>> ○ Examples: Early development in fruit flies, right-handed or left-handed coiling of snail shells, and inheritance of moth larva eye color. 

> ③ Cytoplasmic inheritance

>> ○ Plastid inheritance

>> ○ Mitochondrial inheritance**: Maternal inheritance  

>>> ○ Electron transport chain and ATP synthase are encoded by mitochondrial DNA.  

>>> ○ Heteroplasmy: Due to the cooperation of mitochondria with numerous cellular organelles (mainly the nucleus), not all children of an affected mother inherit the disease.  

>>> ○ **Problem Type 1.**: If mating with a mutant follows Mendelian inheritance → Abnormalities in nuclear DNA required for mitochondrial function.  

>>> ○ **Problem Type 2.** If mating with a mutant follows maternal inheritance → Abnormalities in mitochondrial DNA.  

>>> ○ **Problem Type 3** Yeast: Mitochondria are inherited from both parents.  

> ④ Sex-controlled inheritance: A gene is located on an autosome, but its expression (e.g., dominance relationship) varies depending on the sex of the individual.

>> ○ **Example 1**: The gene for deer antlers exhibits dominant expression in males and recessive expression in females.  

>> ○ **Example 2**: The baldness gene encodes 5α-reductase, which converts testosterone into DHT (dihydrotestosterone). It shows dominant expression in males and recessive expression in females.  

>>> ○ DHT is a substance that enhances male characteristics.  

>>> ○ In females, instead of baldness, symptoms such as thinning of the hair occur.  

> ⑤ Xenia: Paternal inheritance of endosperm traits.  

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Sex and Sex-linkage**

⑴ Determination of sex

> ① Sex determination by chromosomes

>> ○ XY type: ♂ (XY), ♀ (XO) (e.g., human, fruit fly)

>> ○ XO type: ♂ (XO), ♀ (XX)

>> ○ ZW type: ♂ (ZZ), ♀ (ZW) (e.g., poultry)

>> ○ ZO type: ♂ (ZZ), ♀ (ZO)

>> ○ Haploid-diploid type (e.g., honeybees)

> ② Sex determination by environment

>> ○ Example: The reptile's sex is determined by the incubation temperature of the eggs.

> ③ Sex determination by fertilization

>> ○ Example: Unfertilized honeybee eggs develop into males, while fertilized eggs develop into females.

> ④ Gender conversion

>> ○ Example: Some fish change into males based on social signals, but only certain individuals undergo this transformation.

> ⑤ Hermaphrodite

>> ○ Example: C. elegans has both male and female reproductive organs.

⑵ Sex-linked inheritance: Refers to genes located on sex chromosomes. If significant differences are observed in the results of reciprocal crosses, it indicates sex-linked inheritance.

> ① There are 18 genes common to both the X and Y chromosomes.

> ② Y chromosome-linked inheritance (sex-limited inheritance)

>> ○ SRY (Sex-determining Region of the Y Chromosome)

>>> ○ The SRY gene determines sex.  

>>> ○ Contains very few genes.  

>>> ○ In fruit flies, the sex-determining factor is located on the X chromosome.  

>> ○ Ear hair in men

>> ○ Striped patterns in female silkworms

>> W chromosome-linked inheritance

> ③ X chromosome-linked inheritance (sex-linked inheritance): Males express X-linked traits more frequently than females.

>> ○ Color blindness: Green and Red Opsin Genes (X Chromosome)

>>> ○ Blue opsin gene (chromosome 7)

>> ○ Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)

>>> ○ X-chromosome recessive inheritance, incidence of 1 / 3,500 males

>>> ○ The most severe of the 10 muscular dystrophy: Induces muscle cell degeneration.

>>> ○ Uses a wheelchair during puberty. 

>>> ○ Dies before reaching adulthood due to respiratory and heart complications.

>>> ○ DMD gene: 2.4 million bp, consisting of more than 70 exons, encoding dystrophin protein.

>>> ○ Dystrophin

>>>> ○ A protein that links six proteins regulating calcium ion channels in the muscle cell membrane with the cytoskeleton.

>>>> ○ Stabilizes the structure of muscle cells by connecting actin filaments to glycoproteins in the cell membrane.

>>> ○ The DMD gene is unable to regulate channels due to exon deletion.

>> ○ Hemophilia  

>> ○ White eyes in fruit flies

>> ○ Z chromosome-linked inheritance

> ④ Sex-controlled inheritance: Actually not sex-related.

> ⑤ X inactivation: Observed only in mammals

>> ○ Defition: Females have two X chromosomes, so inactivating one of them for quantitative compensation.

>>> ○ Drosophila and C. Elegans double the expression of male X chromosomes for quantitative compensation.

>> ○ Barr body: Inactivated X chromosome, cause of mosaic pattern (e.g., Cat fur color pattern)

>>> ○ Only in mammals.

>> ○ Lyon hypothesis: Female early embryos randomly inactivate one X chromosome in each cell.

>>> ○ In animals, Barr bodies form either before or during cleavage, depending on the species.  

>>> ○ Inactivation is irreversible, but it is reversed only during germ cell formation.  

>>> ○ Once a Barr body is formed, all descendant cells produced through somatic cell division have the same region condensed (e.g., cancer cells).

>> ○ Mechanism

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Generation of Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) from Xist RNA on X chromosome with inactivation determined.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. X chromosome, determined to be activated, methylates Xist RNA to prevent inactivation mechanisms.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. RNA transcribed from the Xist binds to the corresponding X chromosome.

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. RNA interference blocks transcription entirely on the X chromosome that has been determined for inactivation.

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Xist additionally attaches methyl groups to cytosine (C) and deacetylates histones to condense the chromosome → inhibit transcription.

> ⑥ Fragile X syndrome

>> ○ A mutation occurs if the CGG repeat sequence exceeds 200.  

>> ○ Prior to that, it is sequentially classified as permutation, intermediate, and normal (less than 40 repeats).

## **6\. Quantitative Genetics-Genetics and the Environment**

⑴ Quantitative traits (e.g., height, weight) are continuous variation traits, influenced by both genetic differences and environmental factors.

> ① Genetic factors: Polygenic inheritance

>> ○ Traits that have high inheritance indices are consistently expressed regardless of the environment.

> ② Environmental factors: Environmental dependence of genes, environmental dependence of traits

>> ○ Example: Study of identical twins grown in different environments

⑵ Penetrance: The extent to which the expected traits of a particular genotype actually appear.

> ① Complete penetrance: 100% trait is expressed as predicted by genotype.

> ② Incomplete penetrance

> ③ Example: The dominant disorder, polydactyly, has an 80% penetrance.

⑶ Expressivity: The severity of the phenotype expressed in an individual.

⑷ Heritability (Inheritance index): The proportion of variation within a genetic population attributable to genetic factors.

> ① Calculation through correlation analysis between groups

>> ○ Example: Parents and offspring have the same degree of immunity.

> ③ 0.4 ~: Very genetic

> ④ Heredity is based on populations, not individual differences.

> ⑤ Even traits with high heritability can be influenced by the environment.

## **7\. Genetic testing**

⑴ Pedigree analysis

> ① **Tip 1:** Determining Dominance  

>> ○ If non-affected children are born from two affected parents: **Dominant inheritance**.  

>> ○ If affected children are born from two non-affected parents: **Recessive inheritance**.  

> ② **Tip 2:** Determining Sex-Linkage

>> ○ **Tip 2-1**: If the daughter of an affected father is always affected: **Dominant X-linked inheritance**.  

>> ○ **Tip 2-2**: If the son of an affected mother is always affected: **Recessive X-linked inheritance**.  

>> ○ Y chromosome-related disorders are rare due to the small number of genes on the Y chromosome.  

>> ○ If dominance is determined in ①, and **Tip 2-1** and **Tip 2-2** confirm that it is not X-linked, then it is autosomal inheritance.

> ③ Pedigree problems that deviate from these cases are unlikely to appear, as only solvable problems are presented.  

⑵ Prenatal testing

> ① Amniocentesis: Performed around 14–16 weeks of pregnancy. Fetal cells are collected from the amniotic fluid for biochemical tests and karyotype analysis.  

> ② Chorionic villus sampling: Performed around 6–8 weeks of pregnancy. Chorionic villi from the fetus are collected for biochemical tests and karyotype analysis.  

⑶ Genetic fingerprinting test
