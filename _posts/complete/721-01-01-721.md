## Q1. 

Consider a rooted binary tree network. Each internal node x has two children, denoted by x(lhs) and x(rhs). The cost of moving from x to its child x(a) is l<sub>a</sub>, where a ∈ {lhs,rhs}. For each node x, let L<sub>x</sub> be the minimum cost of any path from x to a leaf node. For each leaf node y, define L<sub>y</sub> = 0. Show that for any internal node x the following holds: 

L<sub>x</sub> ​= min<sub>a∈{lhs,rhs}</sub> ​ {l<sub>a</sub> + L<sub>x</sub>(a)}.
