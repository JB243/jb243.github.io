## Q1. 

Consider a rooted binary tree network. Each internal node x has two children, denoted by x(lhs) and x(rhs). The cost of moving from x to its child x(a) is l<sub>a</sub>, where a ∈ {lhs,rhs}. For each node x, let L<sub>x</sub> be the minimum cost of any path from x to a leaf node. For each leaf node y, define L<sub>y</sub> = 0. Show that for any internal node x the following holds: 

<br>

<center>L<sub>x</sub> ​= min<sub>a∈{lhs,rhs}</sub> ​ {l<sub>a</sub> + L<sub>x</sub>(a)}.</center>

## Q2. 

An investor has a fund. It is worth x pounds at time zero, and the principal cannot be withdrawn. The fund pays interest at rate r × 100% per year for T years. At time t, the investor consumes a proportion a<sub>t</sub> of the interest and reinvests the rest in the fund. What choice of {a<sub>t</sub>} should the investor make in order to maximize total consumption?

## S2. 

See [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMjrzLld9W0&list=PLGboZ4litMr_TOwUANH-s-uFnczzy2uuW&index=3). The optimal policy is to save all income at first and then, once a certain threshold is reached, switch to consuming all of it.

## Q3. 

You want to sell a car. At each time (t = 0, ..., T-1), you choose a price p<sub>t</sub>, and then a customer comes and looks at the car. The probability that the customer buys the car at price p is D(p). If the car has not been sold by time T, it is sold for a fixed price W<sub>T</sub>, where W<sub>T</sub> < 1. Maximize the expected reward from selling the car, and find the recursion (dynamic programming / Bellman equation) for the optimal reward when D(p) = max(1 - p, 0).

## S3. 

See [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1VkSkt0EbY&list=PLGboZ4litMr_TOwUANH-s-uFnczzy2uuW&index=7). The expected reward becomes larger as t gets closer to 0, and the price p<sub>t</sub> at time t should be set as: 

<br>

<center>p<sub>t</sub> = ((expected gain at t+1) + 1​) / 2.</center>

<br>

## Q4. 

You own an expensive fish. Each day you are offered a price X for the fish, where X has probability density function f(x). You may either accept or reject the offer. With probability 1−p the fish dies on that day. Find the policy that maximizes the expected profit from selling the fish.

## S4. 

See this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGodjYGcy5A&list=PLGboZ4litMr_TOwUANH-s-uFnczzy2uuW&index=8&pp=iAQB). This system shows a time-invariant characteristics. Thus, the Bellman equation is as follows:

<br>

<center>V<sub>t</sub>(x) = max{x, p𝔼[V<sub>t+1</sub>(X<sub>t+1</sub> ㅣ x)]} = max{x, p𝔼[V<sub>t+1</sub>(X<sub>t+1</sub>)]} = max{x, a},</center>

<br>

where a is a constant. Therefore, the optimal policy is as follows: if x ≥ a, buy it; otherwise, reject it. Here, we can obtain the following fixed-point equation

<br>

<center>a = ∫<sub>-∞ to a</sub> af(y)dy + ∫<sub>a to ∞</sub> yf(y) dy ⇔ 0 = ∫<sub>a to ∞</sub> (y - a)f(y) dy.</center>

<br>

The LHS is fixed to zero, but the RHS is nonincreasing on a, so the fixed-point is unique.
