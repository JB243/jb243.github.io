## **1\. Representation of Physical Quantities :** Scalar

 ⑴ Definition **:** Physical quantity with magnitude only

> ① Etymology **:** Latin word "scalae" meaning 'steps' or 'ladder' → scalaris → scala

> ② Examples **:** Time, length, area, volume, speed, mass, temperature, work, energy

 ⑵ Free in arithmetic operations

## **2\. Representation of Physical Quantities :** Vector

 ⑴ Definition **:** Physical quantity with both direction and magnitude

> ① Etymology **:** Latin word "vehere" meaning 'to carry' → vectus → vector

> ② Examples **:** Force, displacement, velocity, momentum, impulse, electric field, magnetic field

 ⑵ Notation of Vectors

> ① When represented with arrows **:** Arrow length represents vector magnitude. Arrow direction represents vector direction.

> ② When represented with symbols

> ③ Absolute value notation

 ⑶ **Operation 1:** Vector Addition

> ① Methods **:** Parallelogram law, triangle law

> ② **Property 1:** Commutative law

> ③ **Property 2:** Associative law

 ⑷ **Operation 2:** Vector Subtraction

 ⑸ **Operation 3:** Scalar Multiplication of Vectors

 ⑹ **Operation 4:** Vector Resolution

> ① Definition **:** Decomposing each vector into component vectors along orthogonal coordinate directions

> ② Formulation

 ⑺ **Operation 5:** [Scalar Product](https://jb243.github.io/pages/804) (Dot Product)

 ⑻ **Operation 6:** Vector Product (Cross Product)

> ① Definition of cross product **:** Operation satisfying three conditions for v, w ∈ ℝn:

>> ○ v × w is a continuous function of the pair (v, w)

>> ○ v × w is perpendicular to both v and w **:** (v × w) **·** v = (v × w) **·** w = 0

>> ○ If v and w are linearly independent, then v × w ≠ 0

> ② In 3D vectors

>> ○ Cross product of unit vectors **:** (Note) When operated in the order i → j → k, the minus sign does not appear

>> ○ Fundamental formula **:** Cross product of unit vectors can be used for proof

>> ○ Cross product direction **:** Direction of right-hand thumb when curling from A to B

>> ○ Non-commutative property

>> ○ Volume of parallelepiped **:** Volume of parallelepiped formed by vectors a, b, c is as follows

>> ○ BAC-CAB rule

>>> ○ Proof is similar to scalar product proof **:** Start with a simple situation and generalize later

> ③ Multidimensional vectors

>> ○ Satisfying the definition of cross product is only possible when n = 3 or n = 7

>> ○ [Reference paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f6b/ff1e992f60eb87b35c3ceed04272fb5cc298.pdf) **:** Massey, W. S. (1983). Cross products of vectors in higher dimensional Euclidean spaces. The American Mathematical Monthly, 90(10), 697-701.

## **4\. Two Approaches of Newtonian Mechanics**

⑴ Newtonian Analysis

> ① Mechanical analysis using vector quantities such as force and acceleration

⑵ Lagrangian Analysis

> ① Mechanical analysis using scalar quantities such as energy

> ② L (Lagrangian) = T (kinetic energy) - U (potential energy)

⑶ Hamiltonian Analysis

> ① Hamiltonian H = Σ p<sub>i</sub> q<sub>i</sub>′ - L

>> ○ p<sub>i</sub>: Generalized momenta

>> ○ q<sub>i</sub>: Generalized coordinate

> ② In a single-particle, single-system case, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as H = T (kinetic energy) + U (potential energy)

> ③ Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics
