## **1. Rotational Motion System**

**Table. 1.** Major Physical Quantities of Rotational Motion

 ⑴ Angular Velocity ω:  Rate of change of angular displacement per unit time

> ① Angular velocity is defined as positive when counterclockwise

> ② Corresponds to velocity v in translational motion

 ⑵ Angular Acceleration α:  Rate of change of angular velocity per unit time

> ① Angular acceleration is defined as positive when counterclockwise

> ② Corresponds to acceleration a in translational motion

## **2. Uniform Circular Motion**

 ⑴ Centripetal Acceleration and Tangential Acceleration

> ① Centripetal acceleration: Acceleration towards the center in uniform circular motion

>> ○ (Note) Uniform circular motion involves acceleration because the direction of motion constantly changes

>> ○ **Derivation 1:** Derivation using hodograph

**Figure. 1.** Derivation using hodograph 

>> ○ **Derivation 2:** Derivation using dimensional analysis

>> ○ **Derivation 3:** Derivation using coordinate system analysis

> ② Tangential acceleration: Acceleration in the direction of the tangent

>> ○ Always 0 in uniform circular motion

>> ○ Represented by α

 ⑵ Centrifugal Force

> ① Definition:  Centripetal acceleration × Mass of the object

> ② Acts perpendicular to the object's motion direction, so it doesn't increase the object's energy

> ③ Centripetal Force

>> ○ Definition:  Hypothetical force acting radially outward in an accelerating reference frame rotating with the object

>> ○ From the perspective of an observer rotating at the same speed:  The object appears stationary. Equilibrium relationship between centripetal force and centrifugal force

## **3. Non-Uniform Circular Motion**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition:  Net force acting on an object in the direction not perpendicular to the motion direction in circular motion

> ② Period, angular velocity, etc., are not observed to be constant

 ⑵ Theory of Non-Uniform Circular Motion

> ① Non-uniform circular motion of a single point mass

> ② Non-uniform circular motion of multiple point masses

>> ○ r vector:  Vector from the center of rotation to the point mass

>> ○ Direction of τ:  Direction where your thumb points when you curl your fingers from r vector to F vector at a small angle

 ⑶ Rotational Inertia (Moment of Inertia)

> ① Definition:  Sum of the squares of the individual masses (mi) multiplied by the square of their distances (ri) from the axis of rotation Σmi ri2 (unit:  kg·㎡)

> ② Rotational inertia of multiple objects

**Table. 2.** Rotational Inertia of Multiple Objects

> ③ Parallel-Axis Theorem:  Formula to calculate rotational inertia when the center of rotation is not at the center of mass

>> ○ ICM:  Rotational inertia at the center of mass

>> ○ M:  Total mass

>> ○ h:  Distance between the axis of rotation and the center of mass

 ⑷ Angular Acceleration Motion Formula

 ⑸ Torque

> ① Definition:  Cause of angular acceleration in a rigid body

> ② Corresponds to force F in translational motion

> ③ Formulation

 ⑹ Angular Momentum

> ① Formulation

> ② Angular momentum is defined as positive when counterclockwise

> ③ Corresponds to linear momentum p = mv in translational motion

> ④ Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum

>> ○ Law of Torques:  If there is symmetry, there must be a corresponding conserved quantity

>> ○ The universe has rotational symmetry in space

>> ○ The corresponding conserved quantity is believed to be angular momentum

 ⑺ Rotational Energy

> ① Formulation

> ② Rotational energy corresponds to translational kinetic energy in translational motion

> ③ When an object has both translational and rotational motion, total kinetic energy is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energies

 ⑻ Gyroscopic Effect

> ① Definition:  If an object rotates rapidly, it remains stable

> ② Principle:  Angular momentum

> ③ Example:  Riding a bicycle

## **4. Tools and Torque**

 ⑴ Lever

> ① Definition:  A tool for gaining mechanical advantage by setting a fulcrum point, an effort point, and a load point on a beam

>> ○ Fulcrum point:  The point where the beam rests on the fulcrum base

>> ○ Effort point:  The point where the lever applies force to the object

>> ○ Load point:  The point where force acts on the lever

> ② Principle of the lever

> ③ Types of levers

>> ○ First-class lever:  Lever with effort and load points on either side of the fulcrum

>>> ○ Examples:  Scissors, wrench, balance scale, rope, etc.

>> ○ Second-class lever:  Lever with the effort point between the load point and the fulcrum

>>> ○ Examples:  Bottle opener, wheelbarrow, nail clipper, etc.

>> ○ Third-class lever:  Lever with the load point between the effort point and the fulcrum

>>> ○ Examples:  Tweezers, fishing rod, chopsticks, etc.

 ⑵ Axle and Wheel

> ① Definition:  A device consisting of two circular wheels of different diameters attached to a common axis, allowing them to rotate together

> ② Principle of the axle and wheel:  Same as the principle of the lever

> ③ Types of axle and wheel

>> ○ Fixed pulley:  Can lift an object with the same force as its weight by pulling at a constant velocity

>> ○ Movable pulley:  Similar to a second-class lever when lifting an object at a constant velocity

> ④ Examples:  Car steering wheel, gear shift lever, bicycle gears, etc.

 ⑶ **Principle of Work**:  When using a tool to perform work, even if there is a mechanical advantage, the amount of work remains unchanged due to losses in distance traveled
