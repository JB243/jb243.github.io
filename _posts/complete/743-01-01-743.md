> ⑧ Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP)

>> ○ A protein whose structure had recently been solved but not yet released to the research community was used as a target problem.

>> ○ Launched in 1994 and held every two years: initiated by John Moult. Key organizers include Krzysztof Fidelis (LLNL), Michael James (University of Alberta), Shoshana Wodak (Free University), and Fred Cohen (UCSF).

>> ○ Among the early participants was Martin Karplus (recipient of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry).

>> ○ Yang Zhang developed I-TASSER.

>> ○ David Baker first participated in 1998 (CASP3).

>> ○ Google DeepMind first participated in 2016 (CASP12).

>> ○ In 2018, AlphaFold 1 won (around 60 points), and in 2020, AlphaFold 2 won (around 90 points, CASP14).

>> ○ In 2024, separate from Professor Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google DeepMind (first author of AlphaFold 2) received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry as a team.

>> ○ The winner of CASP16 in 2024 was Yang-Server (trRosetta).

>> ○ After President Trump took office, NIH funding for CASP was halted.
