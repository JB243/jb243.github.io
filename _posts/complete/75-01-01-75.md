## 1\. **Genome Project**

⑴ Overview

> ① In 1990, under the leadership of Watson and Francis Collins, it was launched as a 15-year project by a consortium of six countries.

> ② Collaborative research involving over 350 research institutions

>> ○ On June 11, 2000, 84.5% was completed, and a draft was announced.  

>> ○ On April 15, 2003, the final version with 99.99% accuracy was released.  

>> ○ More than 2,800 researchers participated over 13 years, with a total cost of $2.7 billion.

> ③ Side effects of human genome research

>> ○ Birth of [bioinformatics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1831).

>> ○ Facilitating the development of human protein production processes

>>> ○ Insulin: The first protein with a determined sequence.

>> ○ Facilitating the development of automated DNA sequencing instruments  

>> ○ Promoting the genomic analysis of other biologically applicable organisms

⑵ **Methodology 1.** Stepwise sequencing method: Scientists' approach

> ① **Step 1:** Determining restriction enzyme recognition sites

>> ○ After cutting DNA with restriction enzymes and performing electrophoresis, the size of each fragment can be determined.

>> ○ Treating two restriction enzymes in various ways reveals the relative distances between their recognition sites.

> ② **Step 2:** Constructing a gene map

>> ○ Determining the relative distances of genes on the chromosome.

>> ○ Inferring the distance between genes through recombination rates.

> ③ **Step 3:** Physical map (DNA map) construction

>> ○ Significance of determining restriction enzyme recognition sites: By using each restriction enzyme recognition site as a reference, a physical map is progressively constructed based on the sequence information of the obtained fragments.  

>> ○ Significance of gene mapping: Once a physical map is created, it can be compared with the gene map. Introns exist between genes.  

>> ○ Approach Using a single library.

⑶ **Methodology 2.** Shotgun Sequencing (Celera, J. Craig Venter): Entrepreneurial approach

> ① Cutting one DNA in multiple ways.

> ② Determining the entire nucleotide sequence of fragments cut by a single method.

>> ○ Since the length of the analyzed sample is limited, the complete DNA sequence cannot be determined at once.  

> ③ In each method, nucleotide sequences are arranged randomly and repeated until consistent results are obtained.

> ④ A method based on computer science.

⑷ Scientists' approach vs. Entrepreneurial approach

> ① Scientific Community: The Human Genome Project (HGP), led by Watson and Francis Collins. The final cost was $2.7 billion.  

> ② Entrepreneurial Sector: Celera Genomics (launched in 1998), led by Craig Venter. The final cost was $300 million.  

> ③ Both groups released a draft of the human genome in 2001. 

> ④ The scientific community was dissatisfied, believing that the entrepreneurial sector was taking credit for their contributions and investments.

> ⑤ The entrepreneurial sector was frustrated with the scientific community for not sharing data, leading to the development of new methodologies.

> ⑥ The final completion of the genome map was acknowledged as a joint achievement of both groups.

## **2\. Sequencing Technology**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① DNA Sequencing: Applying the principle of DNA replication.

>> ○ Template: Each strand of DNA

>> ○ Substrate: dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP)

>>> ○ NTPs have a hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to the 2' carbon and serve as the building blocks for RNA polymerization.

>> ○ DNA polymerase: Phosphate of the next nucleotide binds to the 3'-OH of deoxyribose.

>> ○ Synthesis direction: 5' → 3', forming complementary base pairs with the template.

>> ○ ddNTP: DNA polymerization is terminated because the 3<sup>rd</sup> carbon lacks an OH group.

> ② RNA Sequencing: Applying the principle of RNA transcription.

> ③ Sequencing by Synthesis

>> ○ Definition: A method of determining nucleotide sequences by detecting signals emitted when a polymerase incorporates nucleotides into the primer sequence.  

>> ○ **Type 1.** CRT (Cyclic Reversible Termination): A cyclic process consisting of incorporation, imaging, and deprotection.  

>> ○ **Type 2.** SNA (Single Nucleotide Addition): Adds only one nucleotide at a time.  

>> ○ Examples: Ion semiconductor sequencing (PGM), Pyrosequencing (Roche 454)  

> ④ Sequencing by Ligation

>> ○ Definition: A method of determining nucleotide sequences by detecting signals emitted when a ligase connects a hybridized sequence to the primer sequence.  

>> ○ 1 or more nucleotide can be incorporated at a time (e.g., dibase). 

>> ○ Examples: Nanoball sequencing, Thermo Fisher SOLiD  

⑵ In vitro cloning: The very first sequencing method

⑶ Dideoxy Chain Termination Method (= Sanger sequencing): Reported in 1977. Sanger's second Nobel Prize.

> ① Substrate: dNTP + ddNTP (in small quantities) + buffer (pH stabilization)

>> ○ ddNTP lacks a 3'-OH group, so it terminates the polymerization reaction.

>> ○ If ddNTP is added in large quantities, all template DNAs are quickly terminated.

> ② Primer

>> ○ Example: p32-primer (CTAG)

> ③ 1<sup>st</sup>. Addition of template DNA and polymerase.

> ④ 2<sup>nd</sup>. After the polymerization reaction, heat is applied to separate the replicated strands.

> ⑤ 3<sup>rd</sup>. After electrophoresis, the sequence is read from an X-ray film or detected using fluorescence.

<br>

> ⑥ Advantages: It can read very long strands, so it is still used in laboratories.

> ⑦ Disadvantages: Requires a large amount of the same DNA strand.

⑷ Dye-dideoxy chain termination method: Using laser.

> ① A small amount of ddNTPs is added to dNTPs, each labeled with one of four fluorescent dyes.

> ② Enables automated DNA sequencing.

⑸ Ion Semiconductor Sequencing (PGM)

> ① Sequencing by Synthesis.

> ② Prone to insertion/deletion errors.

⑹ [Pyrosequencing](https://jb243.github.io/pages/76) (Roche 454)

> ① Definition: A DNA sequencing method that relies on the proportional luminescence produced based on the amount of pyrophosphate generated during DNA synthesis. ~400 bp per read.

> ② Sequencing by Synthesis: Light is emitted when a nucleotide is incorporated, appearing as peaks in a pyrogram.

> ③ Prone to insertion/deletion errors.

> ④ No longer in use.

>>> ○ Initially, sequence with one adapter (Read1 acquisition), then sequence with the opposite adapter (Read2 acquisition).

>>> ○ Read1 and Read2 from the same DNA fragment can be easily matched since they come from the same cluster.

> ⑪ **Application 1.** dUTP method: A representative method for strand-specific sequencing.

>> ○ Background: Used for studying biological functions based on RNA orientation (e.g., regulation of antisense miRNA).

>> ○ **Step 1.** DNA &RNA hybrid: Synthesize cDNA (<span style="color: blue;">first or anti-sense strand</span>) using dT primers (targeting <span style="color: red;">mRNA</span> poly-A tails) and reverse transcriptase.

>>> <span style="color: red;">5'-//-U-//-AAAAAA-3'</span>

>>> <span style="color: blue;">3'-//-A-//-TTTTTT-5'</span>

>> ○ **Step 2.** ds cDNA: Using dUTP instead of dTTP, the <span style="color: green;">second (or sense) strand</span> of cDNA is synthesized using the <span style="color: blue;">first strand</span> of cDNA as a template.

>>> <span style="color: blue;">3'-//-A-//-TTTTTT-5'</span>

>>> <span style="color: green;">5'-//-U-//-AAAAAA-3'</span>

>> ○ **Step 3.** Ligated ds cDNA: Connect Y-adaptors to both ends of ds cDNA.

>> ○ **Step 4.** When treated with UDG (uracil-DNA glycosylase), the <span style="color: green;">second strand</span> of DNA containing uracil is degraded.

>> ○ **Step 5.** Amplify the remaining <span style="color: blue;">reverse antisense strand (first strand)</span> to create the library.

>> ○ In the library raw data, `_1.fastq` represents the <span style="color: blue;">first strand</span>, while `_2.fastq` represents the <span style="color: green;">second strand</span>.

>> ○ Thus, _2.fastq represents the original RNA profile.

⒀ **Single-cell sequencing**

> ⑥ Single-cell genomics (scDNA-seq) + Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq)

>> ○ It allows understanding of how mutation patterns in the genome are related to gene expression in the transcriptome.

>> ○ Technologies for separating DNA and RNA: G&T seq, SIDR-seq, DNTR-seq

⒁ **Single Nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq)**

> ① **Purpose 1.** Muscles are multinucleated cells, so they need to be analyzed at the nuclear level as they are not captured by scRNA-seq.

> ② **Purpose 2.** snRNA-seq captures more various RNA, including introns, pre-mRNA, non-coding RNA, compared to scRNA-seq.

> ③ **Purpose 3.** In snRNA-seq, nuclear RNA is predominantly captured: But a small amount of cytoplasmic RNA is also detected.

>> ○ **Step 1.** Attach a HaloTag domain to a specific target.

>> ○ **Step 2.** The HaloTag functions as a radical-producing Halo ligand, releasing a hydrogen radical (H∙) from the injected alkyne handle to generate an alkyne handle radical.

>>> ○ R-H → R· + H·

>> ○ **Step 3.** Similarly, the HaloTag generates an RNA radical by releasing a hydrogen radical H· from RNA.

>>> ○ RNA-H → RNA· + H·

>> ○ **Step 4.** The alkyne handle radical combines with the RNA radical.

>> ○ **Step 5.** React alkyne-RNA with biotin azide to produce biotinylated RNA.

>> ○ **Step 6.** Separate only the biotinylated RNA using affinity chromatography with streptavidin.

>> ○ **Step 7.** RNA-seq allows for the detection of RNAs close to the specific target.

>>> ○ Reason: Radicals are unstable and cannot travel long distances.

> ③ Relationship between depth and coverage

>> ○ sequencing depth (read depth): Indicates how many times a specific nucleotide appears on average.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e50295ed-070f-40cc-8ca8-2c5f97a9ce93)

**Figure 19.** Definition of depth

<br>

>>> ○ "10x" means it was read 10 times.

>>> ○ Can be defined for each nucleotide.

>> ○ Coverage (c)

>>> ○ c := LN / G

>>> ○ L: Read length

>>> ○ N: Number of reads

>>> ○ G: Haploid genome length

>> ○ [Comparison of depth and coverage](https://www.ecseq.com/support/ngs/how-to-calculate-the-coverage-for-a-sequencing-experiment#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9Ccoverage%E2%80%9D%20in%20NGS%20always%20describes%20a%20relation%20between%20sequence%20reads%20and%20a%20reference%20\(e.g.%20a%20whole%20genome%20or%20al%20locus\)%2C%20unlike%20sequencing%20depth%20which%20describes%20a%20total%20read%20number%20\(Fig.%201\).)

>>> ○ Total read number is expressed as sequencing depth.

>>> ○ The relationship between sequence reads and the reference (e.g., whole genome, a locus) is expressed as coverage.

>>> ○ Apart from this distinction, depth and coverage are very similar concepts.

> ④ Relationship between bulk and read

>> ○ Bulk: total RNA production

>> ○ When the depth is the same, an irrationality arises where RNA read count is inversely proportional to the increase in bulk size. ([ref](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25#:~:text=Estimated%20normalization%20factors,factor%20of%202.))

>>> ○ Example: In spatial transcriptomics, bulk is typically large and depth is low, resulting in low RNA read count.

>> ○ Normalization: Various methods have been introduced to resolve this irrationality.

> ⑤ Relationship between read count and number of reads

>> ○ If read length is less than 250 bp, it is impossible to detect sequence error.

>> ○ Relationship between read length and number of reads per run: There is a trade-off.
