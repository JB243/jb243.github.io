## **1\. Overview**

 ⑴ Maxwell's Third Law

> ① When external current flows, magnetic force is generated.

> ② The intensity of the magnetic field (H) is determined by magnetic force and magnetic resistance.

 ⑵ Magnetic flux or magnetic flux density: Number of magnetic lines passing through an arbitrary cross-sectional area.

> ① Denoted by Φ.

> ② Unit: Weber (Wb)

 ⑶ Magnetization or magnetic flux density: Magnetization per unit area, i.e., B = Φ / A

> ① Denoted by B.

> ② Unit: Wb / m² = Tesla (T) = 10,000 Gauss (G)

 ⑷ Magnetic field

> ① Denoted by H.

> ② Terminology confusion

>> ○ Generally, magnetic field refers to B.

>> ○ Strictly, magnetic field means H.

>> ○ B will be used to represent magnetic field from now on.

> ② Vacuum or air: Magnetic flux density B and magnetic field intensity H are linearly related.

> ③ Magnetic materials

>> ○ Represented by hysteresis curve or B-H curve.

>> ○ High Retentivity: Permanent magnets, advantageous for memory devices.

>> ○ Low Retentivity: Advantageous for AC circuit magnetic circuits.

>> ○ **Area Dimension Analysis**: ［B × H］= J / m³ = Energy per unit volume

>> ○ Area under one cycle of B-H curve = Energy stored in the magnet and then lost as heat = **Energy loss** in AC operation.

>> ○ Hysteresis loss

>> ○ Measured by VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometer)

>> ○ Fleming's Right-hand Rule is used in generators involving Maxwell's Fourth Law.

**Figure 8.** Principle of a Motor

Brushes, i.e., commutators, are clearly shown in the figure above.

<br>

> ① The direction of the rotational force changes periodically, causing oscillatory motion.

> ② Commutator

>> ○ Device that ensures the coil of the electric motor rotates in a consistent direction.

>> ○ Allows current to flow through the coil via contact with the brushes.

>> ○ Brushes: Reverse the direction of current flow through the coil every half turn, ensuring continuous rotation in the same direction.

> ③ Electric motors have brushes, while [generators](https://jb243.github.io/pages/753) do not due to alternating current (AC).

> ② **Case 1.** When the charge carrier is positively charged

>> ○ Moves in the -y direction due to positive charge.

>> ○ Also moves in the -x direction due to Lorentz force.

>> ○ **Expected Result 1.** Magnetic force is generated in the -x direction in the conductor plate.

>> ○ **Expected Result 2.** The potential at point b is higher than at point a in the conductor plate.

> ③ **Case 2.** When the charge carrier is negatively charged

>> ○ Moves in the +y direction due to negative charge.

>> ○ Also moves in the -x direction due to Lorentz force.

>> ○ **Expected Result 1.** Magnetic force is generated in the -x direction in the conductor plate.

>> ○ **Expected Result 2.** The potential at point b is higher than at point a in the conductor plate.

> ④ Actual result

>> ○ The potential at point b is higher than at point a.

>> ○ Conclusion: The charge

 carrier is negatively charged.
