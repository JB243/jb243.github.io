## **2. Faraday's Law** 

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition **:** Voltage is induced corresponding to the rate of change of the magnetic flux within a magnetic field.

> ② In 1820, Oersted discovered that a magnetic field is produced by an electric current.

> ③ In 1831, British scientist Faraday discovered Faraday's law.

> ④ After Faraday proposed Faraday's law, German physicist Lenz introduced Lenz's law.

 ⑵ Formulation **:** It has a negative sign as the rate of change of the magnetic flux passing through the circuit with respect to time.

 ⑷ Induced electromotive force in a constant external magnetic field with a moving rectangular loop at a constant velocity.

 ⑴ Generator

> ① 0° → 90° **:** Increase in magnetic flux density, induced current from a to b direction.

> ② 90° → 180° **:** Decrease in magnetic flux density, induced current from b to a direction.

> ③ 180° → 270° **:** Decrease in magnetic flux density, induced current from b to a direction.

> ④ 270° → 360° **:** Increase in magnetic flux density, induced current from a to b direction.

 ⑵ Electric Guitar

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. The pickup lamp of an electric guitar has a structure in which a coil is wound around a cylindrical magnet.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. When guitar strings are plucked, the magnetized guitar strings under the strings vibrate due to the magnet beneath.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The magnetic flux passing through the coil changes due to the vibration of the strings.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Current flows due to the induced electromotive force generated in the coil.

 ⑶ Microphone

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. A permanent magnet wound with a coil is connected to the diaphragm.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. The diaphragm vibrates due to sound vibrations.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The coil attached to the diaphragm moves around the permanent magnet, inducing a changing magnetic flux, resulting in induced current.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. The greater the sound, the stronger the vibration of the coil, leading to a higher current intensity.

 ⑷ Hard Disk

> ① **Component 1.** Platter **:** Part that records information.

>> ○ Made by coating an aluminum alloy or glass with a layer of ferromagnetic material, typically iron oxide.

>> ○ External magnetic fields align the ferromagnetic material to store information.

>> ○ Even after the external magnetic field is removed, the alignment remains, allowing continuous data storage.

> ② **Component 2.** Head's Core **:** Small electromagnet used to record information on the platter.

> ③ Maxwell's third law is used when recording information on the hard disk.

> ④ Maxwell's fourth law is used when reading information from the hard disk.

 ⑸ Magnetic Tape

> ① Strongly magnetic powder applied to thin plastic tape.

> ② Takes advantage of the property that the magnetic powder becomes magnetized by an external magnetic field to store information.

> ③ Information on the magnetic tape can be read using a head mounted on a magnetic tape player.

> ④ Example: Cards, banknotes
