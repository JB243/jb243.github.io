## **1\. DNA recombination**

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Target gene generation from mRNA (for eukaryotic DNA)

> ① mRNA is reverse transcribed to synthesize cDNA (complementary DNA to mRNA).

> ② RT-PCR: Add DNA primers to the mRNA solution and treat with reverse transcriptase (RT) once.

>> ○ Oligo dT primer: Enables the synthesis of complete cDNA by using the poly A tail, which is present in eukaryotic mRNA, as a template.

>> ○ Random primer (usually hexomer): Can form a variety of cDNA pools.

> ③ RT-PCR: Amplify the amount of cDNA like a normal PCR.

⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Recombinant plasmid

> ① Restriction enzyme: A kind of endonuclease. A scissors that cuts DNA.

>> ○ Restriction enzymes are produced in bacteria to target and degrade foreign DNA.

>> ○ Their own DNA, which could be targeted, is protected by methylation.

>> ○ Blunt ends: Ends that cannot rejoin after being cut by a restriction enzyme.

>> ○ Sticky ends: Ends that can re-form complementary hydrogen bonds after being cut by a restriction enzyme.

>>> ○ Restriction enzymes that form sticky ends are used for DNA recombination.

>> ○ Palindrome recognition: When reading from 5' to 3', the sequences on the sense strand and the antisense strand are identical.

>>> ○ Recombinant sequence by BamHI is also cleaved by Sau3AI. The opposite holds true only in specific cases.

>>> ○ The fragment by BglII and the fragment by BamHⅠ bind to each other and are not cut again by restriction enzymes.

>> ○ When linear DNA is cut once by a restriction enzyme, it becomes two fragments, whereas circular DNA, when cut once by a restriction enzyme, becomes a single fragment.

>> ○ Restriction mapping 

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>\-1<sup>st</sup>. Cut the target DNA and the plasmid DNA with the same restriction enzyme to form the same sticky ends.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>\-1<sup>st</sup>\-1<sup>st</sup>. To prevent self-ligation when treating with only one restriction enzyme, treat with alkaline phosphatase (e.g., Calf Intestinal Phosphatase (CIP)).

>>> ○ DNA recombination: Inserting target DNA into the T-DNA region after injuring the plant and infecting it with recombinant Rhizobium radiobacter.

>>> ○ The recombinant Agrobacterium tumefaciens does not synthesize auxin or cytokinin, preventing the formation of crown gall tumors.

⑷ 4<sup>th</sup>. Screening: Screening for cells or populations with recombinant genes

> ① Antibiotic resistance gene (selection based on proper insertion of recombinant plasmid)

>> ○ Example: Ampicillin resistance gene, tetracycline resistance gene

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Replica formation: After incubating the entire colony, imprint the entire culture plate onto filter paper.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Add antibiotics to a portion of the colonies imprinted on the filter paper.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Colonies that die due to the antibiotic indicate that they were not transformed.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Select colonies corresponding to those that survived the antibiotic on the filter paper.

> ② Antibiotic resistance genes (selection according to recombination success)

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Replica formation: After incubating the entire colony, imprint the entire culture plate onto filter paper.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Add antibiotics to a portion of the colonies imprinted on the filter paper.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Colonies that died due to the antibiotic indicate that the restriction enzyme cut the antibiotic resistance gene.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Select colonies corresponding to those that died due to the antibiotic on the filter paper.

> ③ X-gal (selection according to recombination success)  

>> ○ Cloning gene is inserted into lac Z gene.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. X-gal is originally white, but becomes blue due to lac Z.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. If a colony treated with lacZ-bearing plasmid appears white on X-gal, it indicates successful transformation.

> ④ Reporter Gene  

>> ○ Use genes that are not expressed in the host cell.  

>> ○ Examples: eGFP, tdTomato.

> ⑤ Southern blotting

⑸ 5<sup>th</sup>. Cloning amplification: Large quantities of product are obtained by mass fermentation and purification.

> ① Reason for using antibiotics in large-scale culture with antibiotic-resistant plasmids (non-selective purpose)  

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Plasmids within the bacterial strain are randomly distributed to daughter cells during cell division.  

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. As division continues, some cells end up without any plasmids.  

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Cells containing plasmids consume more energy to replicate them, leading to a difference in growth rate compared to plasmid-free cells.  

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Ultimately, plasmid-free cells become the majority."

> ② Inclusion Body  

>> ○ Since the gene introduced during transformation is not originally present in the host, the produced protein may not fold properly and aggregates.

⑹ Examples

> ① Hormones and bioactive substances: Growth hormone, insulin, secretin, etc.

> ② Therapeutic and diagnostic reagents: Hepatitis B vaccine, diagnosis of HIV infection, interferon, neoendorphin, analgesic, blood coagulation factor, etc.

> ③ Agriculture: Golden rice, herbicide-tolerant crops, pest-tolerant crops

> ④ Ti plasmid transgenic neofunctional crop: Herbicide tolerance, anti-anthrax crops (seed potatoes, etc.)

> ⑤ Recombinant strain development strategy

>> ○ Overexpression mutant  

<br>

<br>

## 2. DNA library

⑴ Vector for DNA library

> ① Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)

>> ○ Advantage: No cross occurs.

>> ○ Disadvantage: Must be adapted to the prokaryotic expression system.

>> ○ Used in [human genome projects](https://jb243.github.io/pages/75#1-genome-project).

>> ○ It is still used today.

> ② Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YAC; pYAC3)

>> ○ Artificial chromosome into yeast (~1 Mb), contains ARS, and inserts DNA between the centromere and telomere.

>> ○ Advantage: Suitable for producing human proteins as it utilizes a eukaryotic system.

>> ○ Disadvantage: Crossover occurs during prophase I of meiosis.

> ③ Virus genome library

>> ○ Disadvantage: Small capacity. Difficult to control breeding.

⑵ Required DNA elements

> ① Centromere: A GC-rich sequence that attaches to the spindle fibers during cell division, ensuring proper distribution of chromosomes to each daughter cell.

> ② Telomere: A nucleotide sequence located at the end of a chromosome that prevents chromosome shortening due to cell division.

> ③ Origin of replication: The site where DNA replication begins.

> ④ Selection marker: A specific DNA sequence used to confirm the proper insertion of artificial chromosomes into cells.

## **3\. PCR** 

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: A DNA amplification technique based on the principles of DNA replication.  

> ② Developed by Kerry Mullis in 1983; he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.

⑵ Sample: DNA sample, DNA primer (2 types), dNTP, Taq polymerase, Buffer (pH stabilization), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (DNA stabilization)

> ① DNA Primer  

>> ○ **Condition 1:** GC content ＞ 50%  

>>> ○ Example: 10 out of 18 bases (= 18/2 + 1) are G or C  

>>> ○ Example: 11 out of 20 bases (= 20/2 + 1) are G or C  

>> ○ **Condition 2:** The 5' end should end with AT, and the 3' end should end with GC  

>>> ○ Reason: Prevents hairpin formation due to self-ligation  
  
>>> ○ Example: 5'-ATGCCTATGCG-3'  
  
>>> ○ Example: 5'-ATGCAGGCTAAT-3' can cause self-ligation  

>> ○ **Condition 3:** The 3' end should have 2 to 3 overlapping Gs or Cs  

>>> ○ Reason: A=T bonds are double bonds, whereas G≡C bonds are triple bonds, making GC-rich sequences more stable  

>>> ○ Example: 5'-ATGCCTATGCG-3'

> ② dNTP  

>> ○ Note that NTPs are the building blocks for RNA polymerization.  

>> ○ Reason why an *E. coli* colony can be used instead of a DNA template in colony PCR: Due to heat-induced denaturation.  

>> ○ In other words, the *E. coli* colony is broken down under denaturation, providing the necessary materials for DNA polymerization.

> ③ Taq polymerase

>> ○ Taq polymerase is derived from the archaea *Thermus aquaticus*, which inhabits high-temperature hot springs.  

>>> ○ It was first discovered in the 1960s in Yellowstone National Park.  

>> ○ Taq polymerase has an optimal polymerization temperature of 55°C and denatures at 92–95°C.  

>> ○ After completing polymerization to the 3' end, Taq polymerase adds an extra A nucleotide.  

>>> ○ Since it does not require a template, it can be applied to recombinant DNA with blunt-ended sequences.  

>> ○ Taq polymerase lacks 3' → 5' proofreading ability, resulting in an error rate of 1/10<sup>4</sup>.  

>>> ○ In contrast, typical DNA polymerases have a replication error rate of 1/10<sup>7</sup>.

> ④ MgCl<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ DNA has a negatively charged phosphate backbone, leading to structural instability → Na<sup>+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> can stabilize DNA.  

> ⑤ IPP (Inorganic Pyrophosphatase)  

>> ○ Enhances the binding of NTPs.

⑶ Process

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. The heating step to separate the two DNA strands. 94 ℃. 30-60 seconds.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Annealing: As the mixture cools, the primers bind to the DNA template. 50-55 ℃. 1 minute.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. DNA elongation: Polymerase starts synthesis at primer. 72 ℃. 1 minute per 1000 bp.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Repeating steps ① to ③ theoretically results in the exponential amplification of the DNA sample by a factor of 2.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. DNA ligase action (40 ℃) and stabilization (4 ℃).

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. Switch to E. coli cloning amplification after a few cycles: In reality, the amount of artificial nucleotides is insufficient, producing much less DNA.

⑷ T<sub>m</sub> vs annealing temperature

> ① DNA Melting Curve: A graphical representation of the degree of DNA denaturation as a function of temperature.  

>> ○ It shows the denaturation level of linear double-stranded DNA at different temperatures using absorbance at 260 nm (A260).  

>> ○ A260 value comparison: Double-stranded DNA ＜ Single-stranded DNA ＜ Fragmented nucleic acids  

>> ○ Reason: Less base stacking leads to lower shielding and higher absorbance.  

> ② T<sub>m</sub> (Melting Temperature): The temperature at which 50% of the DNA remains double-stranded, while the other 50% has denatured into single strands.

>> ○ Generally proportional to (A + T) × 2 + (G + C) × 4. 

>> ○ T<sub>m</sub> value is independent of repetitive sequences.  

>> ○ The T<sub>m</sub> of dsRNA is about 15 ℃ higher than that of dsDNA with the same sequence due to the -OH group in RNA stabilizing dsRNA.  

> ③ Annealing  

>> ○ The annealing temperature is typically set 5–10°C below T<sub>m</sub>.  

>> ○ If the annealing temperature is too high, hybridization is inefficient; if too low, mis-hybridization increases.  

>> ○ The presence of metal ions affects the optimal annealing temperature.

⑸ C<sub>t</sub> (Threshold Cycle)  

> ① Definition: The cycle at which the signal exceeds the threshold value.  

> ② C<sub>t</sub> and copy number have an inverse correlation.

⑹ Limitation: The nucleotide sequences at both ends of the template DNA must be known. 

> ① Assumption: If there is a known sequence in the middle and the template DNA has blunt ends, this limitation can be overcome.

> ② **Solution 1.** Inverse-PCR

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Form circular DNA from the template DNA using DNA ligase.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Generate linear DNA by cutting within the known sequence using a restriction enzyme.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. PCR is possible because we know sequence of both ends.

> ③ **Solution 2.** Anchored-PCR

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Attach a new primer to the template DNA using DNA ligase and amplify one half.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The other half goes through the same process.

> ④ **Solution 3.** Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis

>> ○ **Case 1:** Replicating the template DNA using a primer with only a few mismatched bases.  

>> ○ **Case 2:** Replicating the template DNA using a primer with an added nucleotide sequence that induces a hairpin structure in the middle.  

>> ○ **Case 3:** Replicating the template DNA using a primer with a removed nucleotide sequence to allow the template DNA to form a hairpin structure.

⑺ Types 

> ① RT-PCR: Includes the process of synthesizing cDNA from RNA using reverse transcriptase.  

> ② Real-time PCR (qPCR, quantitative PCR): Allows real-time monitoring of amplified DNA quantity.  

>> ○ Initially, the given nucleotide fragment does not fluoresce because the distance between the fluorescent reporter and quencher is too short.  

>> ○ During polymerization in PCR, the fluorescent reporter and quencher separate, allowing fluorescence to appear.  

>> ○ TaqMan qPCR: A TaqMan probe (containing a fluorophore and quencher) binds to the target DNA and is cleaved during DNA synthesis, generating fluorescence.  

> ③ Multiplex PCR: Amplifies multiple types of DNA samples within a single PCR reaction.  

> ④ Allele-Specific PCR (AS-PCR): A method for detecting allele-specific variations using PCR.

## **4\. DNA fingerprinting**

⑴ Overview

> ① Objective: Paternity confirmation, prediction of genetic diseases, forensic perpetrator identification.

> ② Using the fact that no two individuals, except for identical twins, are genetically identical.

⑵ Electrophoresis: Allows for the separation of substances by size and the estimation of their quantity.

> ① Stationary phase, mobile phase

>> ○ Stationary phase (compression gel, stacking gel) 

>>> ○ Higher gel density results in slower transport of DNA samples or proteins.

>>> ○ Reason for high gel density: To keep the moving speed constant regardless of DNA sample or protein size.

>> ○ Mobile phase (running gel)

>>> ○ Low gel density allows rapid movement of DNA samples or proteins.

>>> ○ Gel density is 6-15%.

> ② Nucleic acid electrophoresis: Agarose gel

> ③ Protein electrophoresis: Polyacrylamide gel + Bisacrylamide gel, SDS-PAGE, TEMED

>> ○ **Material 1.** Acrylamide: Forms polymers in the gel.  

>> ○ **Material 2.** RIPA Buffer: Isotonic solution. Used as a buffer for cell lysis.  

>> ○ **Material 3.** Loading Buffer or Laemmli Sample Buffer: A buffer that breaks disulfide bonds.  

>>> ○ Does not contain methanol but includes SDS-PAGE.

>>> ○ SDS-PAGE: Used for more efficient separation. Applied in denaturing gels.  

>>> ○ SDS-PAGE consists of SDS (an anionic surfactant) and β-ME (β-mercaptoethanol).

>>> ○ SDS: Removes ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Equalizes the charge density per unit mass of proteins.  

>>> ○ β-ME: Eliminates disulfide bonds.  

>>> ○ When SDS-PAGE binds to each amino acid, the repulsion between negative charges results in all proteins having the same charge density, forming a secondary structure.

>>> ○ DTT: An additive that breaks disulfide bonds between cysteine residues.

>> ○ **Material 4.** Transfer Buffer: Used for transferring from gel to membrane.  

>>> ○ Contains methanol but does not include SDS-PAGE.

>>> ○ Native-PAGE: Used in non-denaturing gels.  

>>> ○ Methanol: Functions to cool the heat generated during the transfer process.  

>> ○ **Material 5.** Ammonium Persulfate (APS): Acts as an enzyme that forms cross-links between polyacrylamide and bis-acrylamide gels.  

>> ○ **Material 6.** TEMED (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine): Stabilizes APS and helps the gel solidify quickly.

> ④ Typically the top is the anode, the bottom is the cathode.

> ⑤ Moving distance = Δt × (a × log M + b), a < 0, M: molecular weight

>> ○ When treated with special substances such as SDS, molecular weight is linearly proportional to size, resulting in greater resistance in the mobile phase and a shorter migration distance.

>> ○ Molecular weight has the greatest influence on migration distance.

>> ○ Migration distance is proportional to time (Δt).

>> ○ DNA ladder (size marker): Provides migration distances based on size, allowing estimation of the size of unknown substances.

>> ○ Supercoiled DNA experiences less resistance in electrophoresis.

> ⑥ **Type 1.** General electrophoresis

>> ○ Nucleic acids and proteins with smaller molecular weights migrate further.

>> ○ **In protein electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE causes proteins to migrate from the (-) electrode to the (+) electrode.

> ⑦ **Type 2.** Isoelectric electrophoresis: Electrophoresis using isoelectric points, which are unique values of proteins.

>> ○ Electrophoresis with a pH gradient moves proteins to the point where the total charge is zero (isoelectric point).

>> ○ After electrophoresis, proteins are stained using protein dyes such as Coomassie Blue or silver nitrate.

**Figure 2.** Isoelectric electrophoresis

<br>

> ⑧ **Type 3.** 2D electrophoresis

>> ○ O'Farrel law is common.

>> ○ X-axis: Separation based on charge through isoelectric electrophoresis in the presence of urea or electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions.  

>>> ○ In other words, separation occurs according to the isoelectric point.

>>> ○ Urea: Removes all R-R interactions except disulfide bonds.

>> ○ Y-axis: Separation based on molecular weight through electrophoresis in the presence of SDS.  

>> ○ More than 1,000 types of proteins can be separated.

>> ○ **Application 1.** Separate both the X-axis and Y-axis using the same method, but add a specific substance during Y-axis separation → Substances deviating from the diagonal indicate interaction with the added substance.  

>> ○ **Application 2.** For tRNA and small RNA molecules: Use 10% polyacrylamide gel for 1D and 20% for 2D → Effectively separates various types of RNA.

⑶ **Fingerprinting Method 1.** RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism): Paternity testing, genetic disease analysis

> ① Process: Target genes.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. DNA isolation from tissue.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. PCR: Amplify the amount of DNA.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Cutting DNA into fragments using restriction enzymes.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Generate DNA fragments of different sizes with the same restriction enzyme recognition sites.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Electrophoresis: Separates fragments based on size differences for visualization.

> ② Cause: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

>> ○ Defition: Difference between people due to one base being different by point mutation.

>> ○ In humans, approximately one SNP appears per 1,000 base pairs (bp).

>> ○ SNPs can occur in both exons and introns.

>> ○ If an SNP occurs in a restriction enzyme recognition site, RFLP may occur.

>> ○ Difference between mutation and polymorphism: If it occurs in less than 1% of the entire population, it is considered a mutation; otherwise, it is classified as polymorphism.

>> ○ Number of SNPs: As of 2017, there are approximately 10,000 SNPs.

**Figure 3.** Number of SNPs

<br>

> ③ Limitation: Since SNPs do not necessarily occur at restriction enzyme recognition sites, RFLP variations among individuals are not significant.  

>> ○ Difficult to use for criminal identification and similar applications.

⑷ **Fingerprinting Method 2.** Tandem repeat: Used for suspect identification. A more powerful genetic fingerprinting method than RFLP, targeting repeat sequences.

> ① VNTR (variable number tandem repeat): 15-100 repetitions

>> ○ Principle: The number of repeats in repeat sequences varies among individuals, resulting in fragments of different sizes.

>> ○ Cause: Uneven crossover of homologous chromosome

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. DNA fragments are separated and amplified based on length using electrophoresis.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Separated DNA fragments are transferred to filter paper.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. After transferring to filter paper, a chemical treatment (alkaline) is applied to break hydrogen bonds → Results in single-stranded DNA.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Compare the location of the VNTR fragments with a VNTR probe labeled with radioactive material.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Band appears when exposing filter paper to X-ray film.

> ② STR (Short Tandem Repeat): Repeats of 2-4 times.  

>> ○ Not significantly different from VNTR.

⑸ **Fingerprinting Method 3.** Other Fingerprinting Methods

> ① CNV (Copy Number Variation)

> ② LOH (Loss of Heterozygosity)

> ③ Genomic Rearrangement

> ④ Rare Variant

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Hybridization**

⑴ Southern blotting: Nucleic acid probe hybridization to DNA.

> ① Overview

>> ○ A kind of RFLP.

>> ○ Developed by Edward M. Southern in 1975.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Restriction enzyme treatment → PCR amplification → Electrophoresis

>> ○ Electrophoresis: Agarose gel is used.

>> ○ A master plate can be used instead of electrophoresis: Colonies with recombinant plasmids are arranged on a solid medium.

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The gel is shaken in a 0.5 M HCl solution.  

>> ○ HCl treatment accelerates the transfer of DNA from the agarose gel to the membrane.

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The gel is shaken in a **1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH solution** (DNA denaturation).  

>> ○ The NaOH solution, sponge, and gel are stacked in order to separate DNA into single strands.

>> ○ The sponge absorbs the NaOH solution and supplies it to the gel.

>> ○ To prevent partial reformation of double-stranded DNA, an additional nucleic acid denaturant is added.

>> ○ Nucleic acid denaturants: Metal ions, formamide, formaldehyde, etc. The form series weakens DNA binding strength.

⑴ CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing Technology (also called simply CRISPR technology)

> ① Overview

>> ○ Gene Scissors: A mechanism of gene cleavage in bacteria (e.g., E. coli) to eliminate viral DNA.

>> ○ CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)

>>> ○ Found in 50% of bacterial genomes and 90% of archaeal genomes.

>>> ○ CRISPR arrays consist of repetitive DNA sequences and spacers located between each repetition.

>>> ○ Bacteria or archaea record fragments of external DNA, such as viruses, as spacers between repeats.

>>> ○ Subsequently, the CRISPR-Cas9 system detects and cleaves viral DNA that matches the spacer.

>> ○ Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)

>>> ○ Acquired from organisms like Streptococcus pyogenes. It has two nuclease domains, HNH and RuVC9.

>>> ○ dCas9 (nuclease-deficient Cas9, dead Cas9): Unable to cut DNA but capable of binding to DNA through sgRNA.

> ② **Step 1.** CRISPR Processing: The following describes the CRISPR processing of the subtype I-C/Dvulg Cas5d system in Bacillus halodurans.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Cas5d recognizes hairpin structures and 3' single-stranded sequences in the CRISPR repeat region, cleaving pre-crRNA into unit-length fragments.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Pre-crRNA processing: Further processing of pre-crRNA into smaller crRNAs.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Cas5d forms a complex with crRNA, Csd1, and Csd2 proteins.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Cas9 and sgRNA separate.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. The DNA that formed the bubble reanneals through hydrogen bonding.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. The cleaved template and non-template DNA undergo DNA repair mechanisms.

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Viruses without DNA repair mechanisms are eliminated by the CRISPR/Cas9 mechanism.

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ): Allows for the joining of completely different chromosomes, following the Holliday model.
