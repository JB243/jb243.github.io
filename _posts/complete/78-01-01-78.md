## **1. Darwinian Biology**

⑴ Before Darwin

> ① Linnaeus: Thought that diversity of species is the created form of species

> ② Cuvier

> ③ James Hutton (1726-1797): Gradualism

>> ○ It took much more than 6,000 years for the current landscape to form

>> ○ Natural changes are gradual, not abrupt

> ④ Charles Lyell (1797-1875): Uniformitarianism

>> ○ Hypothesized that the speed of past changes is the same as the speed of current changes

> ⑤ Jean Babtiste de Lamarck (1744-1829): Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics

>> ○ Hypothesized that organs used frequently develop while unused organs degenerate

>> ○ In 1809, in "Philosophie Zoologique," he claimed that organisms on Earth can change over time

>> ○ Recent emphasis on the heredity of acquired traits

> ⑥ Thomas Malthus (1766-1834): 『An Essay on the Principle of Population』

>> ○ Population grows geometrically (exponentially), while food production grows arithmetically.

>> ○ Through Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population, Darwin was led to the idea that, in the struggle for existence, favorable variations are more likely to survive.

⑵ Darwin

> ① Natural Selection: Traits that enable survival thrive in populations and change over time.

> ② Mayr's Logical Inference

>> ○ **Observation 1:** If all individuals reproduce successfully, the population size grows exponentially

>> ○ **Observation 2:** Most populations remain stable in size

>> ○ **Observation 3:** Resources are limited

>> ○ **Inference 1:** Only some survive, leading to competition for resources

>> ○ **Observation 4:** Population members have diverse traits

>> ○ **Observation 5:** A significant portion of variations within a population are hereditary

>> ○ **Inference 2:** Traits with higher survival and reproductive probabilities exist

>> ○ **Inference 3:** Differential survival and reproduction lead to gradual (→ maybe controversial) changes in populations over generations

⑶ Evidence for Evolution

> ① Ongoing Natural Selection (Microevolution)

>> ○ Example: Guppy populations

>> ○ Example: Evolution of drug resistance in HIV

> ② Homology

>> ○ Anatomical Homology

>>> ○ **Example 1:** Mammalian forelimbs: Different functions but shared origin (homologous structures)

>>> ○ **Example 2:** Tail: Humans have vestigial coccyx like primates, but no tail

>>> ○ **Example 3:** Goosebumps: The arrector pili (piloerector) muscle is a tiny muscle at the base of each hair; when it contracts, the hair stands up, making the body appear larger under stress and helping conserve heat.

>>> ○ **Example 4:** Thorns of roses and tendrils of grapes

>> ○ Ontogenetic Homology (Haeckel's Recapitulation Theory): Individual development recapitulates ancestral development.

>>> ○ Example: Derived from a single common ancestor, all chordate embryos form pharyngeal slits and share a developmental pathway in which they possess a tail during early embryonic stages.

>> ○ Vestigial organs

>>> ○ Example: Although flowering plants do not undergo alternation of generations, they form tiny gametophytes within the flower (egg cell: a vestigial organ).

>>> ○ Example: the human appendix; the human coccyx (tailbone).

> ③ Analogous organs: not evidence of common ancestry; refers to convergent evolution.

>> ○ Example: the tendrils of peas and grapes.

> ④ Molecular evidence (similarity of DNA)

>> ○ Example: birds within the same genus have more similar DNA sequences.

>> ○ Example: human (100%) – chimpanzee (99.01%) – gorilla (98.90%) – African monkeys (96.66%).

> ⑤ Biogeographic evidence

>> ○ Example: related species are found near one another (Galápagos finches and those of Ecuador).

>> ○ Example: fossils of human ancestors are found in Africa, where apes live.

>> ○ Example: Pacific and Atlantic pistol shrimps were a single species 3 million years ago, before the Isthmus of Panama formed.

> ⑥ Fossil record

>> ○ Example: the sequence of evolutionary changes in the horse lineage.

⑷ Validity of Alternatives to Evolutionary Hypotheses

> ① Static Model (rejected): Because Earth is much older than 6,000 years, and species clearly change over time.

> ② Transformism (rejected): Because evidence of flexible relationships between organisms is abundant.

> ③ Individual Type Theory (rejected): Because universality of DNA, genetic code, and cellular composition provide evidence for a single origin of life.

> ④ Without Evolution, it's difficult to explain the universality of DNA and protein mechanisms

## **2. Microevolution**

⑴ Definition: Change in gene pool (less controversial)

> ① Natural selection manifests as phenotypic changes, while microevolution manifests as changes in allele frequencies within a population.

⑵ Gene Pool and Allele Frequency

> ① Population: A group of individuals (same species) capable of producing offspring

> ② Population Genetics

> ③ Gene Pool

> ④ Allele frequency

>> ○ The sum of allele frequencies is 1 (A + a = 1).

>> ○ In a two-allele Mendelian locus, let A be the dominant-allele frequency and a the recessive-allele frequency.

>> ○ Dominant phenotype proportion: A<sup>2</sup> + 2Aa (i.e., A<sup>2</sup> + 2·A·a).

>> ○ Recessive phenotype proportion: a<sup>2</sup>.

⑶ Hardy-Weinberg Law

> ① Conservation of Allele Frequencies: Mendelian genetic processes alone cannot alter allele frequencies (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium)

> ② (p + q)<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup> + 2 · p · q + q<sup>2</sup> = 1 (where p and q are frequencies of 2 alleles)

> ③ Conditions for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

>> ○ Large population size where probability can work

>> ○ Random mating

>> ○ Absence of migration and gene flow

>> ○ No mutations

>> ○ No natural selection

>> ○ If any of these conditions is violated, evolution occurs

⑷ Microevolution: When Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium is Broken

> ① Genetic Drift: Phenomenon where allele frequency changes in a small population

>> ○ In small populations, alleles can be changed due to the finite number of mates each generation

>> ○ **Type 1. Bottleneck effect:** A dramatic, temporary reduction in population size (e.g., due to fire or flood) that causes the frequencies of some alleles to increase while others decrease or are lost.

>> ○ **Type 2. Founder effect:** When a small number of individuals become isolated from a large population, forming a new, small population whose gene pool differs from that of the original.

>> ○ **Type 3. Chance event:** A case where carriers of a rare allele happen not to reproduce.

> ② Selective mating: Nonrandom mating.

>> ○ Intrasexual selection (≠ homosexuality)

>> ○ Sexual selection (intersexual choice): choosing mates to maximize reproductive success; e.g., sexual dimorphism between males and females in animals.

>> ○ Assortative mating: a tendency to mate with partners who resemble oneself.

>> ○ Artificial/selective breeding for quality (trait) improvement.

> ③ Mutation

>> ○ Substitution rate in mammals: 3–5 × 10<sup>-9</sup> substitutions per nucleotide per year.

>> ○ Substitution rate in human influenza virus: 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per nucleotide per year.

> ④ Gene flow (migration)

> ⑤ Natural selection: advantageous variants increase in frequency, disadvantageous variants decrease; it does not create new traits.

>> ○ Stabilizing selection: selects intermediate phenotypes → stabilizes the gene pool.

>> ○ Directional selection: selects one extreme phenotype → shifts the gene pool in a particular direction.

>> ○ Disruptive (diversifying) selection: selects both extreme phenotypes → divides the gene pool into two groups.

>> ○ When the effect of natural selection is stronger:

>>> ○ When a dominant phenotype is selected against (because heterozygotes are also eliminated).

>>> ○ When the environment changes rapidly.

>> ○ Example: UV ↑ ⇒ vitamin D ↑, folate ↓

>>> ○ Low UV favors light skin (adequate vitamin D).

>>> ○ High UV favors dark skin (adequate folate).

> ⑥ Hybridization: Reproduction between different species

 ⑸ Conservation of Genetic Variation

> ① Diploidy

> ② Sexual Recombination

> ③ Balancing Selection

>> ○ Heterozygote advantage (overdominance): When heterozygotes have higher fitness/survival than either homozygote in diploids.

>>> ○ HbA: adult hemoglobin; HbS: sickle-cell hemoglobin.

>>> ○ HbA/HbA: susceptible to malaria.

>>> ○ HbA/HbS: resistant to malaria.

>>> ○ HbS/HbS: anemia (sickle-cell disease).

>> ○ Frequency-dependent selection.

> ④ Neutral Mutation

⑹ Results of genetic variation

> ① Homologous gene (homolog): A gene derived from a single ancestral gene.

> ② Orthologous gene (ortholog): Genes that originated from the same ancestral gene but diverged during speciation.

> ③ Paralogous gene (paralog): Within a species, a gene that has duplicated, yielding two copies (alleles) of the gene.

⑺ Evolutionary fitness

> ① Fitness: (number of individuals in the offspring generation with a given genotype) ÷ (number of individuals in the parental generation with that genotype), normalized to a value between 0 and 1.

>> ○ Biological meaning: relative survival and reproduction / reproductive ability.

>> ○ Meaning of normalization: typically multiply by a proportional factor so that the genotype with the highest reproductive success has fitness 1.

>> ○ Implication: the greater the fitness, the more favorable the survival and reproduction.

> ② Adaptive trait: A trait that increases an individual's fitness in a given environment.

> ③ Selection coefficient: The difference in fitness between two individuals; takes a value between 0 and 1.

<br>

<br>

## **3. Macroevolution**

⑴ Macroevolution = speciation ← microevolution + … + microevolution ← a single common ancestor (common descent hypothesis), (much debated).

⑵ Biological species concept: a population whose members can interbreed in nature and produce fertile offspring.

> ① Prezygotic reproductive barriers: fertilization does not occur.

>> ○ Spatial (geographical) isolation: individuals of different species do not come into contact.

>> ○ Temporal isolation: the timing of reproduction differs by species.

>> ○ Behavioral isolation: differences in courtship behavior.

>> ○ Mechanical isolation: differences in the structure of reproductive organs.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> the genitalia of certain insects fit like a lock and key.

>> ○ Gametic isolation: egg-surface proteins that bind sperm do not permit sperm from other species.

>> ○ Reinforcement: when two genetically very similar species inhabit the same area, prezygotic isolation becomes stronger, because strong selection acts to prevent hybrid production between sympatric species.

> ② Postzygotic reproductive barriers: fertilization occurs, but the hybrid cannot reproduce.

>> ○ Reduced hybrid viability (hybrid zygote inviability): development fails due to incompatible/incomplete genetic information.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> a goat–sheep cross can form an embryo, but it dies at an early developmental stage.

>> ○ Reduced hybrid fertility (hybrid sterility): because the hybrid's chromosomes lack homologous pairs, it cannot undergo meiosis.

>> ○ Hybrid breakdown: the F<sub>1</sub> hybrids are healthy, but later generations show reduced survival and fertility.

> ③ <b>Example 1.</b> Liger

>> ○ Offspring born to a tiger and a lion.

>> ○ Infertile, so it is not a biological species.

>> ○ Tigers and lions are not the same species.

> ④ <b>Example 2.</b> Mule

>> ○ Offspring born to a mare and a jack (male donkey).

>> ○ Infertile, so it is not a biological species.

>> ○ Mares and male donkeys are not the same species.

 ⑶ Limits of Biological Species Concept

> ① Cases where the Biological Species Concept (BSC) cannot be applied:

>> ○ Asexual reproduction

>> ○ It is not feasible to test mating/interbreeding ability among all organisms.

>> ○ Fossil species

> ② Alternative species concepts

>> ○ **Morphological species concept**

>>> ○ A conventional species concept based on external (morphological) traits

>>> ○ The most widely used species concept in taxonomic classification

>>> ○ Advantage: can be applied to asexual organisms or fossil organisms where the biological species concept cannot be verified.

>>> ○ Disadvantage: does not always reflect evolutionary independence.

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> when inferring relatedness while reconstructing the emergence and migration routes of ancestral humans

>>> ○ <b>Example:</b> Although wolves and dogs can interbreed, they are not regarded as the same species.

>> ○ **Paleontological species concept**

>> ○ **Ecological species concept**

>>> ○ Premise: Organisms are morphologically and physiologically similar.

>>> ○ If they occupy the same ecological niche, they are classified as the same species.

>> ○ **Phylogenetic/embryological species concept**

>>> ○ Groups with the same evolutionary history, inferred from morphological data and DNA sequences, are regarded as the same species.

>>> ○ Species that diverged from a common ancestor and have the same genetic characteristics.

 ⑷ Mechanisms of Speciation

> ① Allopatric Speciation: Speciation due to geographical isolation within a single population

> ② Sympatric speciation: speciation that occurs within the same geographic area

>> ○ <b>Type 1.</b> Sexual selection: occurs when individuals with certain heritable traits obtain more mates.

>> ○ <b>Type 2.</b> Habitat differentiation: a subpopulation exploits habitats or resources not used by the parent population.

>> ○ <b>Type 3.</b> Polyploidy: arises from errors during cell division that add extra sets of chromosomes.

>> ○ Autopolyploid.

>> ○ Allopolyploid: a polyploid formed from a hybrid produced by mating between two different species, via various subsequent processes.

>>> ○ About 50% of flowering plants originate from polyploidy.

>>> ○ <b>Example.</b> canola: the hybrid of kale and turnip; due to a mitotic error in which nuclear division succeeds but cytokinesis fails, the chromosome number doubles to a diploid state and fertility is restored.

>> ○ Principle of character displacement: sympatric populations tend to show greater trait divergence than allopatric populations.

> ③ Adaptive radiation: the process by which living organisms evolve along multiple lineages to adapt to their environments.

>> ○ Natural selection favors what is well-adapted to the present; it is not an improvement over the past.

>> ○ Natural selection does not produce progress toward a predetermined goal.

> ④ <b>Theory 1.</b> Gradualism (the gradual evolution model)

>> ○ Advocated by Darwin.

>> ○ The theory that small changes accumulate slowly, leading to speciation over millions of years.

> ⑤ <b>Theory 2.</b> [Punctuated equilibrium](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1146)

>> ○ Proposed by Stephen Jay Gould.

>> ○ Based on the scarcity of transitional fossils, it posits that species undergo rapid morphological change and then persist with little further change.

>> ○ Recently integrated with evo-devo (evolutionary developmental biology); related to the homeobox.

> ⑥ Critiques of punctuated equilibrium

>> ○ Genetic change is fundamentally gradual and directionless.

>> ○ If environmental change is minimal, directionless genetic variation results in little change at the species level.

>> ○ If environmental change is great, individuals with particular genetic changes are more likely to survive, and species-level change proceeds rapidly.

>> ○ Because Earth's history includes many abrupt environmental shifts, punctuated patterns are observed.

⑸ Factors influencing the speciation rate

> ① Species richness: the more species within a lineage (clade), the higher the speciation rate.

> ② Size of geographic range.

> ③ Behavior

> ④ Environmental change

> ⑤ Generation time

## **4. Evo-devo Evolutionary Theory**

 ⑴ Evo-devo (Evolutionary Developmental Biology) Theory

 ⑵ Deeply related to [HOX (Homeobox) genes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1453#6-homeo-genes).

 ⑶ Supports the Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

<br>

<br>

## **5. Phylogenetic Tree of Life and Evolution**

 ⑴ Common Characteristics of Organisms: Because they originated from a common ancestor

> ① All organisms have the same basic biochemistry and share the same types of macromolecules

> ② All organisms are composed of cells and have a lipid bilayer membrane as their outer boundary

> ③ Eukaryotic cells share almost identical organelles

 ⑵ Phylogenetic Tree: Represents the path of evolution as a branching tree

 ⑶ Phylogenetic Methods: Molecular Clock

> ① Tracking using rRNA: rRNA has the slowest evolutionary rate

>> ○ Hemoglobin, cytochrome c, fibrinogen, histone proteins can also be used instead of rRNA.

>> ○ Mitochondrial DNA generally mutates about 10 times faster than nuclear DNA

> ② Principle of Parsimony (Minimum Evolution): Choose the phylogenetic tree with the fewest trait changes

>> ○ DNA-DNA hybridization experiment: Closer relationships have higher DNA melting temperatures (Tm)

> ③ Characteristics

>> ○ Ancestral forms are positioned lower, closer relationships are placed closer

>> ○ Slowly evolving sequences allow tracking of distant evolutionary history

>> ○ Looking back far into the past, multiple substitutions ("multiple hits") cause the observed substitution rates of nucleotide and amino-acid sequences to slow down.

>>> ○ Note: The error rate of DNA polymerase remains constant when replicating genes.

> ④ Clade

>> ○ Monophyletic clade: a single common ancestor and all of its descendants.

>> ○ Paraphyletic clade: a clade that includes a common ancestor and only some of its descendants.

>>> ○ Example: Birds evolved from reptiles, yet "Reptilia" is treated as a paraphyletic group that excludes birds.

>> ○ Polyphyletic clade: a grouping that includes taxa with different common ancestors.

> ⑤ Derived characters

>> ○ Ancestral/primitive character: a trait shared by all taxa derived from a single ancestor.

>> ○ Derived character: a trait present in the taxon but absent in the ancestral group.

>> ○ Synapomorphy (shared derived character): a distinctive trait unique to a particular clade; a clue for establishing monophyletic groups.

>> ○ Paraphyletic clade 

> ⑥ Characters by clade
