## **1\. Hypotheses on the Origin of Life** 

⑴ Hypotheses about the origin of life

> ① Spontaneous generation: the doctrine that life arises on its own from non-living matter (rejected)
  
>> ○ Non-living matter + "vital force" → living organisms
   
>> ○ Advocated by Aristotle and other ancient Greeks.

> ② Biogenesis: life arises from pre-existing life → then what about the very first life (the origin of life)? (needs elaboration)

>> ○ <b>Evidence 1.</b> Spallanzani's experiment

>> ○ <b>Evidence 2.</b> Pasteur's experiment (1862): used an S-shaped "swan-neck" flask

> ③ Neo-spontaneous generation (= chemical evolution)

⑵ Hypotheses about the origin of life

> ① Panspermia: bacteria arrived on Earth carried by meteorites (then what about other planets?) (rejected)
   
>> ○ Counterexample: amino acids in meteorites occur as a mixture of L- and D-forms, whereas living organisms use only L-forms.

> ② Creationism: life originated as conveyed in the Bible (low falsifiability) (rejected)

> ③ Chemical evolution: the first life arose from chemical substances.

⑶ Hypothesis of life's origin from inorganic matter (Oparin, A. I.; 1924), also called the Haldane–Oparin hypothesis

> ① The first organic molecules were synthesized from Earth's inorganic materials.

> ② Polymers were formed from organic monomers.

> ③ Some polymers began self-replication.

> ④ As these polymers aggregated with other polymers according to their chemical properties, the first life emerged.

## **2. Emergence of Primitive Organisms**

⑴ Environment of the primitive Earth

> ① Strongly reducing atmosphere

> ② Formation of the oceans: as the Earth cooled, H<sub>2</sub>O condensed.

> ③ Lightning, volcanic activity, and ultraviolet radiation were far more intense.

⑵ Formation of the first organic compounds

> ① Miller's experiment: demonstrated the possibility that, on a prebiotic Earth rich in reducing gases, organic molecules could arise abiotically.

>> ○ Reducing gases: CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>; molecular oxygen was scarce.

>> ○ Abiotic processes: high temperatures and electrical discharges.

>> ○ 1953: analyzed the thin reddish-brown film on the inner wall of the vessel and the solution by paper chromatography.

>> ○ 2008: reanalyzed the archived residues with improved instruments → found 20 amino acids used by living organisms.

> ② Fox's experiments

>> ○ When solutions of organic molecules are dripped onto hot sand or clay, some monomers polymerize as their concentration increases.

>> ○ Proteinoids: polypeptides formed by the spontaneous polymerization of amino acids.

>> ○ It is inferred that macromolecular organics such as nucleic acids, proteins, and ATP were synthesized in the primordial ocean.

⑶ RNA World: Proposed model as DNA has no autocatalytic function

> ① Evidence of the First Genetic Material being RNA

>> ○ **Evidence 1:** Spontaneous polymerization **:** RNA monomers can spontaneously form short RNA polymers

>> ○ **Evidence 2:** RNA can self-replicate without protein enzymes (complementary RNA strand)

>>> ○ DNA replication is more complex and requires many enzymes compared to RNA replication

>> ○ **Evidence 3:** RNA with catalytic function (ribozyme)

>>> ○ RNA's primary structure: Chain

>>> ○ RNA's secondary structure: Hairpin

>>> ○ RNA's tertiary structure: Ribozyme (examples: snRNA, 23s rRNA, 28s rRNA, RNase P (RNA cleavage enzyme function), RNase E)

>>> ○ Catalytic function: Possible because RNA can form complex 3D structures, and contains highly reactive OH group

>>> ○ **Example 1:** RNA splicing, RNA polymerization reaction

>>> ○ **Example 2:** rRNA can catalyze peptide bond formation reaction

>>> ○ **Example 3:** Primary transcript of rRNA can self-remove introns without enzyme help

>>> ○ **Example 4:** Using small RNA molecules, cutting and joining E. coli tRNA primary transcripts is possible

>> ○ **Evidence 4:** Reverse transcriptase

> ② RNA World **:** Mixture of RNA monomers accidentally forms the first gene, leading to continuous formation of complementary strands

> ③ Coevolution of RNA and Proteins **:** Proteins generated by RNA provide protection and assistance to RNA

> ④ DNA-RNA system **:** Evolution of new enzymes that create DNA and RNA copies from DNA

⑷ Replacement of RNA

> ① [RNA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/67) is inherently unstable.

> ② After the RNA world, DNA began to be produced; following a period of coexistence with RNA, systems shifted toward RNA being synthesized from DNA.

⑸ Proto-life (protobionts): in practice, extremely difficult to realize.

> ① Coacervates: small membrane-encased liquid droplets formed when complex organics in the primordial ocean aggregated.

> ② Microspheres: small droplets observed by Fox, formed when proteinoids are placed in hot water and then slowly cooled.

> ③ Features of proto-life

>> ○ Selective uptake of substances

>> ○ It is inferred that coacervates or microspheres further evolved into the first primitive life forms.

⑹ The first living organisms

> ① Genetic material happened to become enclosed by a membranous structure, gaining stability.

> ② As energy mechanisms capable of counteracting entropy (i.e., supplying "negative entropy") were acquired, the first life emerged.

## **3. Emergence of Prokaryotes and the Oxygen Revolution**

⑴ Earliest life forms: heterotrophs that performed anaerobic respiration

⑵ Genetic strategies of early life

> ① <b>Strategy 1.</b> Increase gene utilization: little to no nonfunctional/noncoding sequence

> ② <b>Strategy 2.</b> Remove unnecessary repeats: only the repetitive sequences needed for fine-tuned gene expression were retained.

> ③ Genetic strategies of later life

>> ○ Many tissue-specific enzymes

>> ○ Lower gene utilization

>> ○ Increase in repetitive sequences

⑶ Emergence of simple autotrophic cells

> ① As the oceans' available energy was depleted, organisms arose that used light to synthesize organic matter from CO<sub>2</sub>.

> ② The earliest autotrophs are thought to have had simple photosystems and to have used hydrogen sulfide as the electron donor.

>> ③ <b>Examples:</b> purple sulfur bacteria, green sulfur bacteria, etc.

⑷ Emergence of cyanobacteria 

> ① Autotrophs capable of extracting electrons from water appeared.

>> ○ Fossils of primitive cyanobacteria: stromatolites

> ② As cyanobacteria flourished, the oxygen they produced transformed a reducing atmosphere into an oxidizing one and caused anaerobic organisms to go extinct.

>> ○ Reactive oxygen species (ROS): anaerobes lacking defenses against oxygen were vulnerable to highly reactive ROS.

>> ○ Origin of peroxisomes: there is a hypothesis that peroxisomes were once bacteria.

> ③ Oxygen Revolution (Great Oxidation Event)

>> ○ About 2 billion years ago, cyanobacteria gained an advantage over anaerobes.

>> ○ "Oxygen Revolution": as cyanobacteria became dominant, atmospheric oxygen rose abruptly.

>> ○ Shift from a reducing to an oxidizing atmosphere.

> ④ After the Oxygen Revolution

>> ○ Oxygen-sensitive organisms went extinct: oxygen is a powerful oxidant that damages proteins and nucleic acids.

>> ○ Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formed from O<sub>2</sub> → the ozone layer developed.

>> ○ Emergence of organisms performing aerobic respiration using oxygen: more ATP could be generated from the same amount of glucose.

⑸ Appearance of terrestrial life: with the ozone layer blocking ultraviolet radiation, organisms living in the sea moved onto land.

## **4. Origin of Eukaryotic Cells**

⑴ First prokaryotic cells (≈ 3.5 billion years ago) → first eukaryotic cells (≈ 2.0 billion years ago)

⑵ Oxygen Revolution → radical formation

> ① Radicals → destruction of biomolecules → to protect biomolecules, cells increased in size.

> ② Increase in cell size → decrease in surface area–to–volume ratio → reduced efficiency of material exchange → necessitated increasing surface area via folding of the cell membrane.

⑶ Membrane invagination hypothesis (membrane evolution hypothesis)

> ① The plasma membrane invaginated and layered inward, forming intracellular organelles.

> ② Order of organelle formation: membrane invagination → formation of the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum → Golgi apparatus formed from the ER → lysosomes formed from the Golgi.

⑷ Endosymbiotic theory (proposed by Lynn Margulis)

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. The cell membrane of an anaerobic archaeon folded inward into the cytoplasm (membrane folding).

>> ○ Example of an anaerobic archaeon: Proteobacteria.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. The nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus became independent of the outer membrane.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Ancestral eukaryotes engulfed free-living aerobic bacteria but did not kill them (primary endosymbiosis).

>> ○ Because the ancestral eukaryotes were anaerobic and were attacked by reactive oxygen species, they would have survived better by forming a symbiosis with aerobic bacteria that consumed oxygen.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. The aerobic bacteria survived within the eukaryotes, and both evolved dependently on each other (formation of mitochondria; origin of animal cells).

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. In ancestors of algae and land plants, photosynthetic prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) were engulfed but not digested (secondary endosymbiosis).

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. The cells co-evolved dependently (formation of chloroplasts; origin of plant cells).

> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup>. Multiple additional symbioses gave rise to different algal lineages.

⑸ Evidence for the endosymbiotic theory: observed in mitochondria and chloroplasts

> ① Most crucial evidence: double-membrane structure.

> ② Circular DNA; 70S ribosomes; bacterial promoters and RNA polymerase; fMet-tRNA → antibiotic sensitivity.

>> ○ Eukaryotic nuclear DNA is linear.

>> ○ Eukaryotic cells have 80S ribosomes.

>> ○ Chloroplast circular DNA encodes the Rubisco small subunit (the large-subunit DNA is inserted into nuclear DNA).

> ③ Functional homology of membranes: electron transport chains and the chemical composition of the outer membrane.

>> ○ Cardiolipin in the inner membrane.

>> ○ Aerobic bacteria have electron transport chains in the plasma membrane, and mitochondria have electron transport chains in the inner membrane.

⑹ Emergence of multicellular eukaryotes

> ① Able to adapt to diverse environments because they can possess more functions than unicellular organisms.
