## **1. Biological Classification**

  ⑴ Purpose: A classification of organisms to reveal their relationships with each other.

  ⑵ Methods

> ① Natural Classification: Classifying organisms according to their evolutionary processes or relationships.

> ② Artificial Classification: Classifying organisms based on arbitrary criteria.

>> ○ Example: Terrestrial animals, aquatic plants, medicinal plants, edible fungi, herbivores, etc.

⑶ Methodologies in Systematics

> ① <b>Method 1.</b> Structural similarity (morphology)

>> ○ Used mainly when classifying extinct organisms known only from fossils.

>> ○ The geologic time scale subdivides the history of life, so it is used as a reference in classification.

>> ○ On the basis of such classifications, fossil assemblages are determined and used to refine subdivisions of geologic time.

> ② <b>Method 2.</b> Modern phylogenetic classification (evolutionary systematics)

>> ○ In DNA sequence comparisons, organisms that are evolutionarily close have more similar DNA.

>> ○ Comparisons often use the small-subunit ribosomal rRNA gene, cytochrome c amino-acid sequences, etc.

>> ○ Because these encode essential proteins, they are highly conserved over evolution.

> ③ Modern species are divided—based on structural similarity and evolutionary relationships—into domains and, within them, biological kingdoms.

⑷ Biological Classification System

> ① Hierarchical taxonomic ranks: reflect degrees of relatedness; grouping species within the same taxon implies a shared recent common ancestor.

> ② Taxonomic ranks: Domain – Kingdom – Phylum – Class – Order – Family – Genus – Species (eight levels total).

>> ○ Domains: Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya.

>> ○ Kingdoms: Within Eukarya, Protista, Plantae, Fungi, Animalia.

>> ○ Current framework: three domains and six kingdoms.

> ③ History of classification

>> ○ Aristotle: classified 540 animal species.

>> ○ Two-kingdom system: plants (non-motile) vs. animals (motile).

>> ○ Three-kingdom system: with microscopy, unicellular organisms were placed in Protista.

>> ○ Four-kingdom system: among protists, organisms lacking a nucleus were placed in Monera (Prokaryota).

>> ○ Five-kingdom system: Fungi, which do not perform photosynthesis, were separated from plants.

>> ○ Three-domain/six-kingdom system: discovery that Archaea are more similar to eukaryotes than to true bacteria.

> ④ When finer resolution is needed, insert intermediate ranks between the main ones: subphylum, subclass, suborder, subfamily, subgenus, subspecies.

>> ○ Subspecies: a morphologically and/or geographically distinct population; no reproductive barrier.

>> ○ Variety: a group that differs in two or three traits or in distribution due to natural mutation.

>> ○ Form/cultivar: a group within a species produced by artificial improvement (breeding).

⑸ Scientific Names

> ① Need: to ensure uniformity in scholarly research.

>> ○ Latin is no longer used in daily life, so names do not change with place or time.

> ② Binomial nomenclature: list the genus name and the specific epithet in Latin.

>> ○ Devised by Linnaeus (Sweden) in the 18th century.

>> ○ Genus – specific epithet – author.

> ③ Trinomial nomenclature

>> ○ Used to indicate infraspecific ranks below species: subspecies, variety, form.

>> ○ Genus – specific epithet – (subspecies/variety/form) – author.

> ④ How to write scientific names

>> ○ Genus: capitalized, italic.

>> ○ Specific epithet: lowercase, italic.

>> ○ Subspecies/variety/form: lowercase, italic.

>>> ○ Variety is indicated by inserting "var."

>>> ○ Form is indicated by inserting "for."

>> ○ Author: capitalized, roman (upright) type; may be omitted or abbreviated to initials.

>> ○ <b>Example 1.</b> tiger: <i>Felis tiger</i> Linne

>> ○ <b>Example 2.</b> Korean tiger (subspecies): <i>Felis tiger coreansis</i> Brass

## 2. Domain 

  ⑴ <span style="color: blue;">P</span>rokaryotes (Bacteria Domain + Archaea Domain) vs. <span style="color: red;">E</span>ukaryotes

> ① Nucleus, Mitochondria, Chloroplasts: <span style="color: blue;">A</span>bsent vs. <span style="color: red;">P</span>resent

> ② <span style="color: blue;">U</span>nicellular vs. <span style="color: red;">U</span>nicellular, <span style="color: red;">M</span>ulticellular

⑵ <b>Domain Bacteria</b>

> ① Most bacteria are harmless, but the ones most familiar to us are usually pathogens.

> ② Many bacteria act as decomposers, obtaining nutrients by breaking down the bodies of dead organisms.

> ③ Features unique to Bacteria

>> ○ Cell structure: peptidoglycan (cell-wall component), LPS, teichoic acids.

> ④ RNA polymerase: α<sub>2</sub>ββ'

> ⑤ Useful substances of bacterial origin

>> ○ Antibiotics: over 50% of antibiotics are derived from bacteria.

>> ○ Restriction enzymes: proteins that cut DNA at specific sequences; used in biotechnology.

> ⑥ Initiator amino acid: fMet (formyl-methionine); a hallmark of bacteria; translation is faster than in Archaea and eukaryotes.

>> ○ fMet is associated with faster translation.

⑶ <b>Domain Archaea</b>

> ① Types

>> ○ Thermophilic archaea (hyperthermophiles): inhabit high-temperature volcanic hot springs and deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

>> ○ Halophilic archaea (extreme halophiles): inhabit high-salinity environments such as the Dead Sea and salt pans; maintain high intracellular K<sup>+</sup> to balance osmotic pressure.

>> ○ Acidophilic archaea (extreme acidophiles): inhabit highly acidic environments.

>> ○ Methanogens: inhabit oxygen-poor environments such as swamps and marshes.

> ② Features unique to Archaea: related to cell structures such as phospholipids, cell wall, and S-layer.

>> ○ Ether linkages in phospholipids: an adaptation to extreme environments.

>>> ○ Archaeal phospholipids = phosphate head + ether linkage to fatty acid + fatty acid × 2 + ether linkage to fatty acid + phosphate head.

>>> ○ Bacterial and eukaryotic phospholipids = phosphate head + ester linkage to fatty acid + fatty acid × 2.

<b>Figure 1.</b> Differences between archaeal phospholipids and bacterial/eukaryotic phospholipids.

<br>

>>> ○ As a note, bacterial and eukaryotic phospholipids differ at the hydrophilic end (e.g., ethanolamine).

>>> ○ Phospholipid monolayer: organized by tetraethers.

>>> ○ Many fatty acids show isoprenes: branched hydrocarbons (polyisoprenoid alcohol).

>> ○ Cell wall: pseudomurein with β 1→3 linkages.

>>> ○ Peptidoglycan: unbranched.

>>> ○ Pseudomurein: branched; β 1→3 linkages.

>>> ○ Peptidoglycan contains muramic acid, whereas pseudomurein contains N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid.

>> ○ S-layer: analogous to LPS (Gram-negative bacteria) or teichoic acids (Gram-positive bacteria).

>> ○ Some archaea even have unusual shapes such as rectangles.

> ③ Similarities between Archaea and Bacteria

>> ○ Transcriptional regulation.

>> ○ A single type of RNA polymerase (Archaea also recently corrected to one type).

>> ○ No nuclear envelope; no membrane-bound organelles; unicellular.

>> ○ Circular DNA; plasmids (can move via pili); operons; 70S ribosomes.

>> ○ Restriction enzymes present.

>> ○ Note that Eukaryotes have three RNA polymerases: RNA pol I, II, III.

>> ○ Note that the eukaryote <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> possesses operons.

> ④ Similarities between Archaea and Eukaryotes: related to genome composition and regulation

>> ○ Transcription mechanism.

>> ○ Initiator amino acid is Met.

>> ○ Histone proteins and introns present.

>> ○ TATA box sequence present.

>> ○ HU: a histone-like protein in prokaryotes.

>> ○ Branched hydrocarbon chains in membrane lipids.

>> ○ Not susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, or lysozyme (these target peptidoglycan).

>> ○ Not susceptible to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, or tetracycline (these specifically target bacterial ribosomes).

> ⑤ Note that even in eukaryotic cells, histone protein genes lack introns.

> ⑥ Archaea inhabit extreme environments (high temperature, high pressure, high salinity, etc.).

>> ○ Because they are less competitive than aerobic bacteria, they colonize environments where ordinary life cannot survive.

>> ○ <i>Taq</i> polymerase is derived from the archaeon <i>Thermus aquaticus</i>.

> ⑦ rRNA base sequences are more similar to those of the Eukarya than to those of Bacteria → Archaea are more closely related to Eukarya.
