<br>

## **4\. Organ System**

⑴ Example: Digestive system, respiratory system, circulatory system, endocrine system, nervous system, exercise system, immune system, etc.

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Individual : Homeostasis**

⑴ Animal classification according to the internal environment control method

> ① Regulator: Uses internal control mechanisms to reduce internal changes caused by external fluctuations

> ② Conformer: Changes the internal environment according to the external environment

⑵ Negative feedback control: Mechanisms of change reduction to eliminate the causes of environmental changes in the body

> ① **Class 1.** Feedback inhibition: Feedback circuits interfere with enzyme and metabolic mechanisms  

> ② **1-1.** Concerted feedback inhibition

>> ○ Each final product must be above a certain concentration to inhibit the enzyme

>> ○ Enzyme has more than one allosteric site

> ③ **1-2.** Cumulative feedback inhibition

>> ○ Each final product partially inhibits the enzymes involved in the initial reaction

>> ○ If the sum of each amount of the final product exceeds a certain level, the total enzyme is inhibited

> ④ **Class 2.** Feedback repression: Feedback circuitry interferes with gene transcription (↔ induction)

⑶ Positive feedback: a mechanism that amplifies changes by increasing the factors causing the change in the internal environment; it does not contribute to homeostasis.

> ① **Example 1.** Blood clotting

> ② **Example 2.** Uterine contractions at birth

> ③ **Example 3.** Reproductive cycle: Estrogen

> ④ **Example 4.** Neuronal action potential

⑷ Change in homeostasis

> ① Set points and normal ranges for homeostasis may vary for different environments

>> ○ Example: Most animals have lower body temperatures when they are sleeping than when they are awake

> ② One way to change the normal range of homeostasis is the process of adapting to changes in the external environment.

>> ○ Example: Physiological changes in mammals ascending from sea level to highlands include increased blood flow to the lungs and increased red blood cell production.

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Individual: Metabolic regulation**

⑴ Bioenergetics: determines how much food an animal requires and limits its behavior, growth, and reproduction.

> ① Metabolic rate: The amount of energy used per unit time, the amount of energy required for the entire biochemical reaction for a given time

> ② Energy strategy

>> ○ In general, endothermic animals have a much higher metabolic rate than ectothermic animals.

>> ○ Endothermic animals can sustain intense activities (e.g., long-distance running, active flight) for longer periods than ectothermic animals.

>> ○ In general, endothermic animals have lower tolerance to internal temperature fluctuations and require a greater food intake compared to ectothermic animals.

⑵ Effect on metabolic rate

> ① Size and metabolic rate

<center><b>Figure. 3.</b> Correlation between BMR and Body Size</center>

<br>

>> ○ Excessive size of the animal limits mobility

>> ○ Larger animals increase energy cost per body mass

>> ○ The larger the animal, the more adequate the exchange system for exchanging material (eg: Circulatory system)

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/EPdyT/btrz0CxrvN7/WcEC9t2CwKoqTfYN4RJxg0/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 4.</b> Each part of the body with increased surface area for mass exchange</center>

>> ○ body mass index (BMI)

>>> ○ Defition: Weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared

>>> ○ BMI ≥ 30: Obesity. BMI <18.5: Low weight

> ② Activity

>> ○ Maximum metabolism rate: Occurs during intense activity and is inversely proportional to duration of activity

>> ○ Minimum metabolic rate: Promote life-sustaining functions such as cell maintenance, respiration, and heart rate, divided into basic metabolic rate and standard metabolic rate

>> ○ Basal metabolic rate (BMR): The metabolic rate of an endothermic animal that is resting, has an empty stomach, and does not grow under stress. Determined within the environmental temperature range.

>>> ○ Example: Adult men 1600-1800 kcal / day, adult women 1300-1500 kcal / day

>> ○ Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR): the metabolic rate of an ectothermic animal that is at rest, not eating, and not under stress at a specific temperature. The metabolic rate varies depending on the environmental temperature.

> ③ Animal form

>> ○ Streamlined animal body design reduces frictional resistance when moving

>> ○ The flat body design has a large surface area per unit volume, which is advantageous for mass exchange.

⑶ Energy balance: Percentage of items where energy is used

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/lUFtl/btrzS1yzoZv/klWKCsVP6JijMILeaUEK41/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 5.</b> Annual energy expenditure for each animal</center>

> ① Endothermic Animal Energy Balance

>> ○ Significantly consumes a large percentage of energy

>> ○ The proportion of energy spent on thermoregulation is inversely related to body size.

> ② Ectothermic Animal Energy Balance

>> ○ Very low percentage of energy spent on thermoregulation

>> ○ Significantly less energy expenditure than endothermic animals of the same size

⑷ Dormancy and energy conservation

> ① Hibernation: Adaptation to winter cold and food shortage

>> ○ Example: Hibernating Ground Squirrel: Lowers body metabolism by lowering body temperature

> ② Estivation: An adaptation to prolonged periods of high temperatures and limited water availability.

> ③ Daily torpor: All endothermic animals that undergo daily torpor are small in size. It is considered an innate cycle regulated by the biological clock.

>> ○ Example: Bats feed at night and enter torpor during the day. They continue to exhibit daily torpor even when food is continuously available.

<br>

<br>

## **7\. Individual : Thermoregulation**

⑴ Necessity of Thermoregulation

> ① **Necessity 1.** The temperature at which the enzyme is active is limited, so most cell functions are limited to a narrow temperature range.

>> ○ The average human body temperature ranges from 37 to 37.8°C.

>> ○ A temperature below this range can lead to hypothermia.

>> ○ A temperature above this range can cause brain damage.

> ② **Necessity 2.** Heat continues to develop in life.  

>> ○ Standard adult men produce 87 W for sleep, 115 W for rest or office work, 230 W for bowling, 440 W for severe physical labor

>> ○ Adult women produce about 15% less heat because their bodies are smaller than in adult men  

> ③ **Necessity 3.** Heat exchange between the skin and the external environment (conduction, convection, radiation, evaporation)

>> ○ The key to thermoregulation is to equalize heat gain and heat loss.

>> ○ Animals perform thermoregulation to reduce heat exchange as a whole

⑵ Classification of animals based on thermoregulation

> ① Endotherm: an organism that regulates its body temperature using heat produced internally.

> ② Ectotherm: an organism that regulates its body temperature using external sources of heat.

> ③ Homeotherm: generally an endothermic animal; maintains a constant body temperature.

> ④ Poikilotherm: generally an ectothermic animal; body temperature varies within a certain range.

> ⑤ Both endothermic and ectothermic animals regulate body temperature by controlling blood flow.

⑶ Methods of Thermoregulation

> ① **Method 1.** Active heat production: generally applies only to endothermic animals

>> ○ **Method 1-1.** Shivering thermogenesis: heat production through muscle activity such as movement or shivering

>> ○ **Method 1-2.** Non-shivering thermogenesis: involves brown adipose tissue

>> ○ **Method 1-3.** Thyroxine and metabolic heat

>> ○ Some large reptiles can increase their metabolic rate through shivering

> ② **Method 2:** Evaporative cooling: generally applies only to endothermic animals

>> ○ Panting

>> ○ Sweating: observed in many terrestrial animals; they have sweat glands regulated by the nervous system

>> ○ Saliva spreading: observed in some kangaroos and rodents

>> ○ Regulation of evaporative cooling through changes in the amount of mucus on the body surface

> ③ **Method 3:** Behavioral responses

>> ○ Ectothermic animals rely more heavily on behavioral thermoregulation than endothermic animals

>> ○ Honeybees: use thermoregulation mechanisms based on social behavior; on cold days, the density of the swarm and heat production increase

> ④ **Method 4:** Heat and adaptation

>> ○ Surface area: species living in cold environments tend to have smaller surface areas

>> ○ Insulation: reduces heat flow between the animal and the environment

>>> ○ Examples: fur, feathers, fat layers

>> ○ Circulatory adaptations: adjust the volume of blood flow between the body core and the skin in response to changes in environmental temperature

>>> ○ Vasodilation: increases blood flow to the skin surface, enhancing heat loss to the environment
  
>>> ○ Vasoconstriction: decreases blood flow to the skin surface, reducing heat loss

>> ○ Countercurrent heat exchange: a system that minimizes heat loss

<br>

**Figure 6.** Example of countercurrent heat exchange

<br>

>>> ○ Adjacent blood vessels carry blood in opposite directions to maximize heat transfer.
  
>>> ○ Some of the heat from arterial blood flows into venous blood, helping to maintain core body temperature.

> ⑤ **Method 5:** Acclimatization in thermoregulation

>> ○ Acclimatization in endothermic animals:

>>> ○ **Example 1:** Adjusting the degree of insulation (e.g., growing thicker fur in winter and shedding it in summer)
  
>>> ○ **Example 2:** Seasonal changes in the capacity for metabolic heat production

>> ○ Acclimatization in ectothermic animals: often involves adjustments at the cellular level

>>> ○ **Example 1:** Producing enzyme variants with the same function but different optimal temperatures

>>> ○ **Example 2:** Maintaining membrane fluidity across various environmental temperatures by altering the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fats
  
>>> ○ **Example 3:** Some organisms in extremely cold environments produce antifreeze compounds to lower the freezing point

⑷ **Application 1:** Automatic Thermoregulation in Vertebrate: The hypothalamus in the diencephalon regulates body temperature

<br>

<img width="313" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c1e497a-1607-45c8-8319-c55910b4124e" />

**Figure 7.** Automatic Thermoregulation Machanism in Hypothalamus

<br>

> ① Set point

>> ○ The hypothalamus is the brain region responsible for temperature regulation.

>> ○ It compares the body’s internal temperature to the set point using internal thermoreceptors → detects cold or heat

> ② Use of feedback information

>> ○ The hypothalamus stimulates the autonomic nervous system and the pituitary gland

>> ○ When the hypothalamus detects cold → vasoconstriction in the skin reduces blood flow to the surface, shivering occurs → heat generation

>> ○ When it detects heat → vasodilation increases skin blood flow, panting occurs → heat loss

> ③ **Function 1:** Heat acts as a defense mechanism against infection

>> ○ Pyrogens raise the set point

>> ○ During infection, macrophages secrete interleukins → hypothalamic set point increases → body temperature rises → immune enzymes become more active and microbial growth is inhibited

> ④ **Function 2:** Lowering the set point can conserve energy

⑸ **Application 2:** Drosophila and Heat Shock Proteins

> ① HSF (heat-shock factor) binds to HSE (heat-shock element) upstream of the HSP70 gene, inducing HSP70 expression

> ② HSF proteins gain binding activity to HSE in response to heat shock

<br>

<br>

## **8\. Individual : Osmotic control**

⑴ Osmotic Control Challenge: Moisture Balance of Various Animals

> ① Classification according to the method of maintaining water balance

>> ○ Osmoconformers: animals that do not actively regulate their internal osmolarity. There is minimal net movement of water.

>> ○ Osmoregulators: animals that maintain an internal osmolarity different from their external environment. Continuous energy expenditure is required.

> ② Osmotic Control of Seawater and Freshwater Animals

>> ○ Sea animals: Water intake with high salt concentration, water leaks from the body surface by osmosis → Salt discharge from gills, small amount of urine with high salt concentration

>> ○ Freshwater animals: Water intake with low salt concentration, water inflow into body surface by osmosis → Salt intake from gill, large amount of urine with low salt concentration

> ③ Water bear: Trehalos protects cell membranes and proteins during dehydration

⑵ Energetics of Osmotic Control: Saving energy

> ① Adapts body fluids to the salinity of the habitat to save energy consumed to balance water and solutes

> ② Transport epithelium: Take saline as an example.

>> ○ Carrier epithelial cells in charge of solute transport consist of one or several layers

>> ○ Large surface area in the form of complex tubes

>> ○ Example: Seagulls consume 50% of the water they drank through the saline while removing 80% of salt

> ③ Countercurrent exchange

>> ○ The direction of blood flow is opposite to the direction of salt excretion in the lumen of the secretory tubule.

>> ○ This countercurrent system maintains a salt concentration gradient along the entire length, promoting the movement of salts from the blood into the tubule.

⑶ Osmoticity of the human body

> ① Water inflow (/ day)

>> ○ Drink Intake: 1250 mL

>> ○ Water of food: 1000 mL

>> ○ Metabolic generation: 350 mL

>> ○ Total inflow: 2600 mL

> ② Moisture Outflow (/ day)

>> ○ Unconscious loss (lungs, skin): 900 mL

>> ○ Sweat: 100 mL

>> ○ Feces: 100 mL

>> ○ Urine: 1500 mL

>> ○ Total Outflow: 2600 mL

> ② **Type 1.** CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> Buffer System: Open buffer system, most effective

>> ○ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>, pK<sub>a</sub> = 6.1

> ③ **Type 2.** Protein Buffer System

>> ○ protein·H<sup>+</sup> ⇌ protein + H<sup>+</sup>, pK<sub>a</sub> = 4 ~ 12

> ④ **Type 3.** Phosphate Buffer System 

>> ○ H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> ⇌ HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>, pK<sub>a</sub> = 6.9

⑸ Edema

> ① Defition: Swelling caused by the movement of water from the blood into tissue fluid

> ② **Cause 1.** Sleep after eating high salt: Ramen broth)

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The kidneys do not work and salt is not released well

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Salin accumulation in the blood

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Blood delivers salt to tissues for osmolality

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Osmotic pressure increases water content in tissue

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Edema occurs

> ③ **Cause 2.** Kidney disease

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Kidney does not function smoothly and cannot release salt well.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Salin accumulation in the blood

> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Blood delivers salts to tissues for osmolality

>>○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Osmotic pressure increases water content in tissue

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Edema occurs.

> ④ **Cause 3.** Fasting

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Reduced concentration of albumin, a temporary energy source in the blood

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Blood Osmotic Pressure Reduction Effect

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The presence of net water movement from the blood to tissue fluid

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Edema occurs

> ⑤ **Cause 4.** Exercise

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Increased blood pressure

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The presence of net water movement from the blood to tissue fluid

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Edema occurs
