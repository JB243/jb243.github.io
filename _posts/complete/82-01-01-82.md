## **1. Key Steps in Food Processing**

 ⑴ Four main steps

> ① Ingestion: The act of eating

>> ○ Suspension feeders: Animals that eat suspended particles in liquids (e.g., humpback whales)

>> ○ Substrate feeders: Animals that eat their environment (substrate) (e.g., caterpillars, maggots)

>> ○ Fluid feeders: Animals that feed on bodily fluids (e.g., mosquitoes)

>> ○ Bulk feeders: Animals that consume relatively large food pieces (e.g., African rock python)

> ② Digestion: The process of breaking down food into small molecules that can be absorbed by the body

>> ○ Peristalsis (mechanical digestion): The process by which the smooth muscles of the digestive tract wall contract rhythmically to create waves that propel food forward.

>> ○ Segmentation (mechanical digestion): In the case of larger food particles, rhythmic contractions of smooth muscle break the food into smaller pieces.

>> ○ Chemical digestion: The process of breaking down polymers into monomers through enzymatic hydrolysis.

> ③ Absorption: The process of absorbing amino acids, monosaccharides, etc.

> ④ Excretion and Elimination: The process of expelling undigested materials from the digestive tract

> ⑤ Why polymers can't be used directly

>> ○ Cellular absorption: Polymers can't pass through cell membranes

>> ○ Species specificity

>>> ○ Polymers in animals' bodies don't match those in food

>>> ○ However, all organisms use the same monomers to build their own polymers

>> ○ Immune response

 ⑵ Classification of Digestion by Digestive Compartment

> ① Digestive compartments: Digestion occurs only within specialized compartments, reducing the risk of self-digestion.

> ② Intracellular digestion

>> ○ Phagosome: Simplest digestive compartment, where digestion occurs after fusion with lysosomes

>> ○ Endocytosis, Phagocytosis

>> ○ Sponge animals: Digest food via intracellular digestion

> ③ Extracellular digestion

>> ○ Occurs in compartments continuously connected to the external environment

>> ○ Can digest larger food particles compared to intracellular digestion

>> ○ Gastrovascular cavity

>>> ○ Performs digestion and distribution of nutrients to the entire body

>>> ○ Observed in platyhelminthes.

>>> ○ Hydra: Digestive enzymes are secreted from the gland cells of the gastrodermis lining the gastrovascular cavity.

>>> ○ Undigested materials exit through a single opening that serves as both mouth and anus

>> ○ Complete digestive tract, alimentary canal

>>> ○ Food moves in one direction

>>> ○ Allows step-by-step digestion and absorption

>>> ○ Can eat new food before previously eaten food is completely digested

 ⑶ Tissue Layers of Vertebrate Digestive Tract

> ① Structure: Mucosa, Submucosa, Submucosal Plexus, Two Layers of Smooth Muscle Cells, Serosa

> ② The digestive tract generally maintains the longitudinal muscles contracted and the circular muscles relaxed, thereby increasing the surface area of the canal wall.

> ③ Internal circular muscle: Segmentation, prevents backflow

> ④ External longitudinal muscle: Peristalsis

## **2. Step 1: Oral Cavity, Pharynx, Esophagus**

 ⑴ **Teeth:** Mastication (mechanical digestion)

> ① Carnivores: Well-developed sharp incisors and canines, pointed small premolars and molars for breaking and cutting food

> ② Herbivores: Broad, ridged teeth with wide surfaces for grinding tough plant material.

> ③ Omnivores: Possess a less specialized dentition.

> ④ Human teeth: Enamel layer, dentin layer, and pulp cavity.

 ⑵ Saliva

> ① Secreted by salivary glands even before eating through reflexes or conditioning

> ② Salivary Glands

>> ○ Secretion of saliva from acinar cells

>> ○ The salivary glands consist of three pairs in total: the sublingual glands, the parotid glands, and the submandibular glands.

>> ○ Pathway of salivary secretion: Food → Taste receptors on the tongue → Sensory nerves → Medulla oblongata → Motor nerves → Salivary secretion

> ③ Components of Saliva

>> ○ Provides moisture to food

>> ○ Mucin: Acts as a lubricant, making food slippery for easy swallowing

>> ○ Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-): Neutralizes oral acidity (buffer) **→** Prevents tooth decay

>> ○ Lysozyme

>>> ○ Breaks β 1→4 linkage of peptidoglycan

>>> ○ Peptidoglycan is a major component of bacterial cell walls

>> ○ **Amylase**

>>> ○ Converts polysaccharides (no taste) → maltose (sweet taste)

>>> ○ Irregular hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in starch, breaking it down into maltose and dextrins.

>> ○ Fatty acids: Makes saliva slightly acidic, and inhibits bacterial growth

>> ○ Lingual lipase

>>> ○ In newborns, since digestive enzymes are still immature, fat can be broken down by lingual lipase.

>> ○ [IgA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/86): Antibodies that remove parasites, etc.

> ④ Regulation of Saliva Secretion

>> ○ Regulated by the medulla oblongata, the autonomic nervous center.

>> ○ Sympathetic nervous system inhibits saliva secretion, and parasympathetic nervous system stimulates it.

>> ○ The sympathetic nervous system inhibits saliva secretion, resulting in increased viscosity of saliva.

 ⑶ **Process of Swallowing Food**

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. When food is not being swallowed: Contraction of esophageal sphincters, elevation of epiglottis **→** Opening of airway, closure of esophagus

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Bolus of food reaches the pharynx, triggering the swallowing reflex (deglutition reflex)

>> ○ Larynx: Upper part of the respiratory tract

>> ○ As the larynx moves upward, it pushes the epiglottis backward → the epiglottis closes over the glottis, the entrance to the airway (closing the airway).

>> ○ Relaxation of esophageal sphincter **→** Opening of esophagus

>> ○ Controlled by the medulla

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Food enters the esophagus, the larynx moves downward, and the airway opens.

>> ○ Uvula rises to prevent food from going backward

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Waves of muscle contraction (peristalsis) move the bolus down the esophagus to reach the stomach.

 ⑷ **Esophagus:** Peristalsis, Segmentation, Mucus (lubrication)

> ① Upper Esophageal Sphincter: Striated muscle, involved in deglutition reflex

> ② Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES, Cardiac Sphincter): Smooth muscle, involved in peristalsis

>> ○ Located below the diaphragm, regulated under the same intra-abdominal pressure as the stomach.

>> ○ Prevents food from refluxing into the esophagus.

>> ○ Normally remains closed, but when stimulated by food, the LES reflexively relaxes and opens.

>> ○ In late pregnancy, increased intra-abdominal pressure from the upward displacement of the abdominal cavity (toward the thoracic cavity) can compress the stomach, occasionally causing the LES to open.

>> ○ Heartburn: impaired control of the LES → reflux of gastric juice → esophageal damage → ulcer

>> ○ Vomiting

>>> ○ Controlled by the medulla oblongata (vomiting center).

>>> ○ Serves as an instinctive protective function against toxic substances.

>>> ○ Vomiting reflex is triggered by gastric or intestinal distension, stimulation of intestinal walls, chemical receptors in the brain, or head rotation.

>>> ○ During vomiting, the gastric outlet closes while the inlet loosens, causing food to flow backward.

>>> ○ Vomiting not only damages the esophagus but also raises gastric pH, impairing proper digestive function.

## **3. Step 2: Stomach**

 ⑴ Structure

<br>

<img width="677" height="278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bdee33a-d556-44d1-bdeb-456e9f5f6a72" />

**Figure 2.** Structure of the Stomach

<br>

> ① Muscular pouch-shaped organ

> ② Cardiac portion (cardia) connects to the esophagus, and pyloric portion (pylorus) connects to the duodenum

> ③ Ways stomach wall cells protect themselves from proteolytic enzyme pepsin and strong acid hydrochloric acid

>> ○ Formation of a protective mucous barrier by mucus

>> ○ Epithelial cells of stomach wall form tight junctions to protect the stomach wall

>> ○ Rapid cell division of basal cells helps repair damaged cells, regeneration every 3 days

>> ○ Secretion of inactive enzymes (e.g., pepsinogen, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen) due to cell damage

> ④ Structure of Gastric Musculature: Mucosa - Submucosa - Muscularis Externa - Longitudinal Muscle - Serosa

>> ○ Submucosa: Distribution of blood vessels like veins and arteries. Helicobacter pylori commonly resides here

>> ○ Muscularis Externa: Connected to serosa through mesentery

>> ○ Myenteric Plexus: Controls the alimentary canal

 ⑵ Functions: Storage (2 ~ 3 L), Digestion, Defense

> ① Residence Time: Carbohydrates ＜ Proteins ＜ Lipids

> ② Prolonged residence time of lipids inhibits digestion

> ③ Absorption: Alcohol

 ⑶ Mechanical Digestion: Peristalsis, Mixing Movement

> ① Peristalsis: Generated by pacemaker cells (Cajal cells) rhythmically contracting, promoting smooth muscle contractions

> ② As stomach expands due to food, mechanical digestion is enhanced

 ⑷ Chemical Digestion (2 L/day): Protein digestion by gastric juice

> ① Gastric Juice Secretion: Food → Stimulation of stomach wall → Gastrin secretion → Blood → Stomach gland stimulation → Gastric juice secretion

> ② Pepsinogen

>> ○ Endopeptidase: Hydrolyzes peptide bonds within proteins to break them down into polypeptides.

>> ○ Optimal pH for pepsinogen is 2.

>> ○ Pepsinogen secretion from chief cells, activated into pepsin by hydrochloric acid.

>> ○ Pepsin reactivates pepsinogen (auto-catalysis, positive feedback).

>> ○ Pepsin recognizes N-termini of Phe, Trp, Tyr to hydrolyze peptide bonds on the amino group side.

> ③ Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)

>> ○ Function: Disrupts tertiary structure of proteins for digestion.

>> ○ H+-K+-ATPase in parietal cells (wall cells) actively transports H+ and Cl- passively for HCl secretion.

>>> ○ Cl-/HCO3- cotransport: Secondary active transport, Cl- imported from blood vessel, HCO3- exported to blood vessel.

>>> ○ H+/Cl- cotransport: Primary active transport, secretion towards stomach.

>>> ○ Result: Stomach interior becomes acidic, blood pH increases.

>> ○ Stomach acid maintained at pH 1 ~ 3 **→** Tissue breakdown, pathogen removal.

>> ○ Active function: Activates pepsinogen to pepsin, prorenin to renin.

>> ○ Acidic tide: Phenomenon in reptiles like crocodiles or snakes after overeating, blood pH rises to 0.5 ~ 1.0, causing torpor.

>> ○ Increased secretion of hydrochloric acid due to buffering effect of protein-rich food.

> ④ Mucus

>> ○ Mucin (glycoprotein), cells, salt, water mixture secreted by goblet cells.

>> ○ Function: Protects stomach lining, provides lubrication.

>> ○ Stomach epithelial cells regenerate every 3 days to protect the stomach wall.

>> ○ Gastric ulcer

>>> ○ Ammonia secreted by Helicobacter pylori helps survival in stomach acid.

>>> ○ Ammonia additionally disrupts mucin function, leading to gastric ulcers.

> ⑤ Gastrin

>> ○ G cells in the pyloric antrum secrete gastrin upon physical, chemical (protein, peptide) stimuli.

>> ○ Gastrin, histamine, vagus nerve: Promote gastric juice secretion.

> ⑥ Somatostatin

>> ○ Function: Inhibits excessive gastric juice secretion.

>> ○ D cells secrete somatostatin.

>> ○ Somatostatin has various other functions like GH inhibition, TSH inhibition, [link](https://jb243.github.io/pages/89).

> ⑦ Prorenin: Renin facilitates clotting of milk protein casein for easy digestion, found in milk-fed infants' gastric juice.

> ⑧ Mucin: Secreted by mucous cells, protects stomach wall composed of proteins from hydrochloric acid and pepsin.

> ⑨ Gastric Juice (Chyme): Acidic fluid formed by mixing partially digested food with gastric juice, passes through pylorus to duodenum.

> ⑸ Gastric Motility

> ① Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes continuously, forming acidic chyme.

> ② Pyloric sphincter muscle: Located between stomach and duodenum, controls pyloric reflex.

>> ○ **Closed case:** Expansion of duodenum, ↑ acidity, ↑ fat, ↑ cholecystokinin, long reflex, short reflex
**→** Inhibition of pyloric sphincter muscle relaxation **→** Maximizes digestion efficiency.

>> ○ **Open case:** When contents of duodenum become alkaline (after digestion in duodenum), pylorus reflexively opens.

>> ○ Regulated by enterogastrones (general term for intestinal hormones).

>> ○ Long reflex: Sympathetic nervous system ↑, parasympathetic nervous system ↓.

>> ○ Short reflex: Involves enteric nervous system.

**Figure 9.** Regulation by Enterogastrones

<br>

> ① Secretin: Responds to acidity, stimulates pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, neutralizes gastric acid, inhibits gastrin secretion

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Acidic chyme from the stomach stimulates cells in the duodenal wall: Secretin secretion into the blood

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Secretin stimulates the gastric wall → decreases gastric acid secretion

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Secretin stimulates the duodenal mucosa → promotes secretion of pancreatic juice rich in bicarbonate (NaHCO3) → neutralizes acidic chyme

>>> ○ H+ and Na+ are expelled from the liver into the blood → lowers blood pH

>>> ○ Stomach raises blood pH, offsetting the decreased pH in the duodenum

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Closure of the pyloric sphincter → prevents further entry of acidic chyme from the stomach into the duodenum

> ② Cholecystokinin (CCK): Responds to fats. Stimulates pancreatic and bile secretion for fat digestion

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Fatty acids from the stomach stimulate cells in the duodenal wall

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. CCK is secreted into the blood from cells in the duodenal wall

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. CCK stimulates the gastric wall → decreases gastric acid secretion

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. CCK stimulates the duodenal mucosa → increases secretion of pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. CCK stimulates the gallbladder → bile secretion → emulsification of fats

> ③ GIP, VIP, GLP-1: Respond to high osmolarity in the small intestine due to sugars and fats, inhibit gastric acid secretion

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Chyme from the stomach stimulates cells in the duodenal wall

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. GIP is secreted into the blood from cells in the duodenal wall

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. GIP stimulates the gastric wall → decreases gastric acid secretion

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. GIP stimulates the crypts of Lieberkühn → promotes secretion of intestinal juice

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. GIP stimulates the mucosa → stimulates insulin secretion

 ⑹ Regulation by the Enteric Nervous System

<br>

<img width="820" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f04a340c-30bc-4831-a24b-04d01b4b0fcf" />

**Figure 10. Regulation by the Enteric Nervous System**

<br>

> ① Basic digestion control is regulated by the autonomic nervous system's central controller, the medulla

> ② Conditioned Reflex: Influenced by the brain and previous experience

>> ○ Beneficial bacteria

>> ○ Intermediate bacteria: Act in ways similar to both beneficial and harmful bacteria

> ④ **Example 1:** E. coli (Escherichia coli)

>> ○ Produces Vitamin K, Vitamin B7 (biotin), and Vitamin B9 (folic acid), leading to vitamin deficiencies if antibiotics are overused

>> ○ Engages in anaerobic metabolic reactions, producing methane and hydrogen sulfide gases as byproducts

>> ○ Accounts for one-third of the weight of feces, excluding water

>> ○ E. coli found in lakes and rivers serves as an indicator of pollution from untreated sewage

>> ○ E. coli O157 is a harmful strain of E. coli

> ⑤ **Example 2:** Probiotics

⑶ Sphincter: Two exist between the colon and anus

> ① Internal Anal Sphincter: Involuntary muscle

> ② External Anal Sphincter: Voluntary muscle

⑷ Defecation

> ① Defecation: Spinal reflex related to rectal wall distension, reflex begins when feces enter the empty rectum

> ② Diarrhea: Caused by lower digestive tract infection and nerve stimulation, leads to dehydration, disturbance in cardiac contraction due to electrolyte imbalance

> ③ Constipation: Dietary fiber (e.g., cellulose) intake helps prevent constipation

> ④ Flatulence: Ammonia, methane gas, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, benzophenone, skatole (odor-causing substances)

> ⑤ A significant portion of feces consists of bacteria, fecal color is due to bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells

**Figure 11.** Absorption of Nutrients

<br>

⑴ Mostly absorbed through the mucosa of the small intestine and transported through blood vessels and lymphatics in mucosal tissue

> ① Mucosal cells of the small intestine are connected by desmosomes and tight junctions: Prevent movement of digestive products between cells, prevent movement of membrane proteins

> ② Absorption from the stomach: Alcohol and small amounts of drugs

> ③ Absorption from the large intestine: Water and electrolytes absorption

⑵ Amino acids, monosaccharides: Secondary active transport with Na+

<br>

<img width="507" height="465" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98cda77b-cabc-4388-aac1-0af7f1a00974" />

**Figure 12.** Absorption of Amino Acids, Monosaccharides

<br>

> ① Unlike glucose, fructose is absorbed via facilitated diffusion

> ② Small intestine villus capillaries **→** Hepatic portal vein **→** Liver **→** Hepatic vein **→** Inferior vena cava **→** Right atrium **→** Whole body

>> ○ (Note) Hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein, which carry blood directly from the heart to the liver, are distinct

>> ○ Liver performs various metabolic functions: glucose regulation, removal of harmful substances before blood circulation, absorption of water-soluble nutrients

> ③ Amino acids vs. dipeptides, tripeptides

>> ○ Amino acids: Absorbed into small intestine epithelial cells through co-transport with sodium

>> ○ Dipeptides, tripeptides: Absorbed into small intestine epithelial cells through co-transport with hydrogen ions

⑶ Lipids: Absorbed via diffusion

<br>

**Figure 13.** Absorption of Lipids

<br>

> ① Absorption of lipids

>> ○ 1st. Emulsification: Bile salts emulsify fat globules into fat particles

>>> ○ Bile salts synthesized in the liver

>>> ○ Bile salts act as surfactants to promote emulsification

>>> ○ Bile salts are recycled

>> ○ 2nd. Lipolysis: Released by pancreas, lipase breaks micelle particles into monoglycerides and free fatty acids

>> ○ 3rd. Lipid absorption: Monoglycerides, free fatty acids are absorbed via diffusion

>> ○ 4th. Lipid synthesis: Monoglycerides are resynthesized into triglycerides by enzymes in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum

>> ○ 5th. Chylomicrons: Transported through lymphatics in the form of cholesterol-protein complexes (micelles) for excretion

>>> ○ Chylomicrons are water-soluble

>> ○ 6th. Chylomicrons are excreted via lymphatics

>> ○ 7th. Chylomicrons are transported to lacteals in the center of villi since they are too large to pass through capillaries

>>> ○ Lacteals are part of the lymphatic system

>> ○ Free fatty acids are utilized in cellular respiration after beta-oxidation

>> ○ Can also be absorbed as diglycerides in the small intestine villi

> ② Intestinal lymphatics **→** Lymphatic vessels **→** Thoracic duct **→** Left subclavian vein **→** Superior vena cava **→** Right atrium **→** Whole body

>> ○ Lipids, glycerol, fat-soluble vitamins, cholesterol, etc., are primarily absorbed through intestinal lymphatics

>> ○ Serum albumin assists in the movement of fatty acids in the blood

> ③ Lipoproteins: Particles surrounded by proteins to enable solubility in water

>> ○ Lipids themselves are not soluble in water, so they must form complexes with proteins to move in the bloodstream

>> ○ Components: Apolipoproteins (Apo), phospholipids, cholesterol, triacylglycerol, proteins

>> ○ Types of lipoproteins

<br>

## **7. Regulation of Appetite Hormones**

⑴ Overview

> ① Appetite-regulating hormones all act on neuropeptide Y

> ② Neuropeptide Y induces overeating

⑵ Leptin

> ① Produced by fat cells

> ③ **Leptin experiments**

>> ○ _Ob_ protein: Leptin protein

>> ○ _Db_ protein: Receptor on hypothalamic cell membranes for leptin

>> ○ _ob/ob_ mice: Become obese due to lack of leptin secretion from fat cells

>> ○ _db/db_ mice: Produce more leptin than normal mice but their brain's leptin receptors don't function, leading to obesity

>> ○ Application: Can connect blood vessels of two mice and observe phenotypic changes after a certain time

>> ○ Example: _ob_ / _ob_ , _Db_ / _Db_ × _Ob_ / _Ob_ , _db_ / _db_: _ob_ / _ob_ , _Db_ / _Db_ mice return to normal while _Ob_ / _Ob_ , _db_ / _db_ mice remain obese

⑶ PYY

> ① Produced in the small intestine after a meal

> ② Acts as an appetite suppressant, opposite to ghrelin

⑷ Insulin

> ② Acts on the brain to suppress appetite

⑸ Cholecystokinin (CCK)

> ① Hormone secreted when food enters the duodenum

> ② **Function 1:** Appetite suppression: Acts on nerve endings of the vagus nerve, sending signals of fullness to the brain

> ③ **Function 2:** Inhibition of gastric juice secretion

> ④ **Function 3:** Stimulation of digestive enzyme secretion

> ⑤ **Function 4:** Stimulation of bile secretion

⑹ Ghrelin
