## **1. Key Steps in Food Processing**

 ⑴ Four main steps

> ① Ingestion: The act of eating

>> ○ Suspension feeders: Animals that eat suspended particles in liquids (e.g., humpback whales)

>> ○ Substrate feeders: Animals that eat their environment (substrate) (e.g., caterpillars, maggots)

>> ○ Fluid feeders: Animals that feed on bodily fluids (e.g., mosquitoes)

>> ○ Bulk feeders: Animals that consume relatively large food pieces (e.g., African rock python)

> ② Digestion: The process of breaking down food into small molecules that can be absorbed by the body

>> ○ Peristalsis (mechanical digestion): The process by which the smooth muscles of the digestive tract wall contract rhythmically to create waves that propel food forward.

>> ○ Segmentation (mechanical digestion): In the case of larger food particles, rhythmic contractions of smooth muscle break the food into smaller pieces.

>> ○ Chemical digestion: The process of breaking down polymers into monomers through enzymatic hydrolysis.

> ③ Absorption: The process of absorbing amino acids, monosaccharides, etc.

> ④ Excretion and Elimination: The process of expelling undigested materials from the digestive tract

> ⑤ Why polymers can't be used directly

>> ○ Cellular absorption: Polymers can't pass through cell membranes

>> ○ Species specificity

>>> ○ Polymers in animals' bodies don't match those in food

>>> ○ However, all organisms use the same monomers to build their own polymers

>> ○ Immune response

 ⑵ Classification of Digestion by Digestive Compartment

> ① Digestive compartments: Digestion occurs only within specialized compartments, reducing the risk of self-digestion.

> ② Intracellular digestion

>> ○ Phagosome: Simplest digestive compartment, where digestion occurs after fusion with lysosomes

>> ○ Endocytosis, Phagocytosis

>> ○ Sponge animals: Digest food via intracellular digestion

> ③ Extracellular digestion

>> ○ Occurs in compartments continuously connected to the external environment

>> ○ Can digest larger food particles compared to intracellular digestion

>> ○ Gastrovascular cavity

>>> ○ Performs digestion and distribution of nutrients to the entire body

>>> ○ Observed in platyhelminthes.

>>> ○ Hydra: Digestive enzymes are secreted from the gland cells of the gastrodermis lining the gastrovascular cavity.

>>> ○ Undigested materials exit through a single opening that serves as both mouth and anus

>> ○ Complete digestive tract, alimentary canal

>>> ○ Food moves in one direction

>>> ○ Allows step-by-step digestion and absorption

>>> ○ Can eat new food before previously eaten food is completely digested

 ⑶ Tissue Layers of Vertebrate Digestive Tract

> ① Structure: Mucosa, Submucosa, Submucosal Plexus, Two Layers of Smooth Muscle Cells, Serosa

> ② The digestive tract generally maintains the longitudinal muscles contracted and the circular muscles relaxed, thereby increasing the surface area of the canal wall.

> ③ Internal circular muscle: Segmentation, prevents backflow

> ④ External longitudinal muscle: Peristalsis

## **2. Step 1: Oral Cavity, Pharynx, Esophagus**

 ⑴ **Teeth:** Mastication (mechanical digestion)

> ① Carnivores: Well-developed sharp incisors and canines, pointed small premolars and molars for breaking and cutting food

> ② Herbivores: Broad, ridged teeth with wide surfaces for grinding tough plant material.

> ③ Omnivores: Possess a less specialized dentition.

> ④ Human teeth: Enamel layer, dentin layer, and pulp cavity.

 ⑵ Saliva

> ① Secreted by salivary glands even before eating through reflexes or conditioning

> ② Salivary Glands

>> ○ Secretion of saliva from acinar cells

>> ○ The salivary glands consist of three pairs in total: the sublingual glands, the parotid glands, and the submandibular glands.

>> ○ Pathway of salivary secretion: Food → Taste receptors on the tongue → Sensory nerves → Medulla oblongata → Motor nerves → Salivary secretion

> ③ Components of Saliva

>> ○ Provides moisture to food

>> ○ Mucin: Acts as a lubricant, making food slippery for easy swallowing

>> ○ Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-): Neutralizes oral acidity (buffer) **→** Prevents tooth decay

>> ○ Lysozyme

>>> ○ Breaks β 1→4 linkage of peptidoglycan

>>> ○ Peptidoglycan is a major component of bacterial cell walls

>> ○ **Amylase**

>>> ○ Converts polysaccharides (no taste) → maltose (sweet taste)

>>> ○ Irregular hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in starch, breaking it down into maltose and dextrins.

>> ○ Fatty acids: Makes saliva slightly acidic, and inhibits bacterial growth

>> ○ Lingual lipase

>>> ○ In newborns, since digestive enzymes are still immature, fat can be broken down by lingual lipase.

>> ○ [IgA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/86): Antibodies that remove parasites, etc.

> ④ Regulation of Saliva Secretion

>> ○ Regulated by the medulla oblongata, the autonomic nervous center.

>> ○ Sympathetic nervous system inhibits saliva secretion, and parasympathetic nervous system stimulates it.

>> ○ The sympathetic nervous system inhibits saliva secretion, resulting in increased viscosity of saliva.

 ⑶ **Process of Swallowing Food**

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. When food is not being swallowed: Contraction of esophageal sphincters, elevation of epiglottis **→** Opening of airway, closure of esophagus

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Bolus of food reaches the pharynx, triggering the swallowing reflex (deglutition reflex)

>> ○ Larynx: Upper part of the respiratory tract

>> ○ As the larynx moves upward, it pushes the epiglottis backward → the epiglottis closes over the glottis, the entrance to the airway (closing the airway).

>> ○ Relaxation of esophageal sphincter **→** Opening of esophagus

>> ○ Controlled by the medulla

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Food enters the esophagus, the larynx moves downward, and the airway opens.

>> ○ Uvula rises to prevent food from going backward

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Waves of muscle contraction (peristalsis) move the bolus down the esophagus to reach the stomach.

 ⑷ **Esophagus:** Peristalsis, Segmentation, Mucus (lubrication)

> ① Upper Esophageal Sphincter: Striated muscle, involved in deglutition reflex

> ② Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES, Cardiac Sphincter): Smooth muscle, involved in peristalsis

>> ○ Located below the diaphragm, regulated under the same intra-abdominal pressure as the stomach.

>> ○ Prevents food from refluxing into the esophagus.

>> ○ Normally remains closed, but when stimulated by food, the LES reflexively relaxes and opens.

>> ○ In late pregnancy, increased intra-abdominal pressure from the upward displacement of the abdominal cavity (toward the thoracic cavity) can compress the stomach, occasionally causing the LES to open.

>> ○ Heartburn: impaired control of the LES → reflux of gastric juice → esophageal damage → ulcer

>> ○ Vomiting

>>> ○ Controlled by the medulla oblongata (vomiting center).

>>> ○ Serves as an instinctive protective function against toxic substances.

>>> ○ Vomiting reflex is triggered by gastric or intestinal distension, stimulation of intestinal walls, chemical receptors in the brain, or head rotation.

>>> ○ During vomiting, the gastric outlet closes while the inlet loosens, causing food to flow backward.

>>> ○ Vomiting not only damages the esophagus but also raises gastric pH, impairing proper digestive function.

## **3. Step 2: Stomach**

 ⑴ Structure

<br>

<img width="677" height="278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bdee33a-d556-44d1-bdeb-456e9f5f6a72" />

**Figure 2.** Structure of the Stomach

<br>

> ① Muscular pouch-shaped organ

> ② Cardiac portion (cardia) connects to the esophagus, and pyloric portion (pylorus) connects to the duodenum

> ③ Ways stomach wall cells protect themselves from proteolytic enzyme pepsin and strong acid hydrochloric acid

>> ○ Formation of a protective barrier by mucus

>> ○ Epithelial cells of stomach wall form tight junctions to protect the interior of the stomach wall

>> ○ Rapid cell division of basal cells helps repair damaged cells, regeneration every 3 days

>> ○ Secretion of inactive hydrolases (e.g., pepsinogen, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen) 

> ④ Structure of the stomach muscle: mucosa – submucosa – circular muscle – longitudinal muscle – serosa

>> ○ Submucosa: Contains blood vessels such as veins and arteries; main habitat of Helicobacter pylori

>> ○ Serosa: Connected to the peritoneum through the mesentery

>> ○ Vagus nerve: Extrinsic nerve that regulates the enteric nervous plexus

 ⑵ Functions: Storage (2 ~ 3 L), Digestion, Defense

> ① Residence Time: Carbohydrates ＜ Proteins ＜ Lipids

> ② Prolonged residence time of lipids inhibits digestion

> ③ Absorption: Alcohol

 ⑶ Mechanical Digestion: Peristalsis, Mixing Movement

> ① Peristalsis: Cajal cells generate spontaneous pacemaker activity, promoting smooth muscle movement.

> ② As stomach expands due to food, mechanical digestion is enhanced

 ⑷ Chemical Digestion (2 L/day): Protein digestion by gastric juice

> ① Gastric Juice Secretion: Food → Stimulation of stomach wall → Gastrin secretion → Blood → Stomach gland stimulation → Gastric juice secretion

> ② Pepsinogen

>> ○ Endopeptidase: Hydrolyzes peptide bonds within proteins to break them down into polypeptides.

>> ○ Optimal pH for pepsinogen is 2.

>> ○ Pepsinogen secretion from chief cells, activated into pepsin by hydrochloric acid.

>> ○ Pepsin reactivates pepsinogen (auto-catalysis, positive feedback).

>> ○ Pepsin recognizes N-termini of Phe, Trp, Tyr to hydrolyze peptide bonds on the amino group side.

> ③ Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)

>> ○ Function: Disrupts tertiary structure of proteins for digestion.

>> ○ Parietal cell: The H⁺-K⁺-ATPase on the parietal cell membrane actively transports H⁺ and passively transports Cl⁻, resulting in the secretion of hydrochloric acid.

>>> ○ Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransport: Secondary active transport, Cl<sup>-</sup> imported from blood vessel, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exported to blood vessel.

>>> ○ H<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransport: Primary active transport, secretion towards stomach.

>>> ○ Result: Stomach interior becomes acidic, blood pH increases.

>> ○ Stomach acid maintained at pH 1 ~ 3 **→** Tissue breakdown, pathogen removal.

>> ○ Active function: Activates pepsinogen to pepsin, prorennin to rennin.

>> ○ Alkaline tide: A phenomenon in which animals such as crocodiles and snakes experience an increase of 0.5 to 1.0 in blood pH after feeding, due to excessive acid secretion; considered a cause of postprandial drowsiness.

>> ○ The higher the protein content in food, the greater the buffering effect against acid, thereby stimulating hydrochloric acid secretion.

> ④ Mucus

>> ○ Mucin (glycoprotein), cells, salt, water mixture secreted by mucous cells.

>> ○ Function: Protects stomach wall, and provides lubrication.

>> ○ Stomach epithelial cells regenerate every 3 days to protect the stomach wall.

>> ○ Gastric ulcer

>>> ○ Ammonia secreted by Helicobacter pylori helps survival of themselves in stomach acid.

>>> ○ Ammonia additionally disrupts mucin function, leading to gastric ulcers.

> ⑤ Gastrin

>> ○ When the pyloric region of the stomach is stimulated physically or chemically (by proteins or peptides), the G cells located in the pylorus secrete gastrin.

>> ○ Gastrin, histamine, and the parasympathetic nervous system: stimulate gastric juice secretion.

> ⑥ Somatostatin

>> ○ Function: Inhibits excessive gastric juice secretion.

>> ○ D cells secrete somatostatin.

>> ○ Somatostatin has various other functions like GH inhibition, TSH inhibition, [link](https://jb243.github.io/pages/89).

> ⑦ Prorennin: Rennin coagulates casein, the protein in milk, making it easier to digest; present in the gastric juice of infants.

> ⑧ Mucin: Secreted by mucous cells, and protects stomach wall composed of proteins from hydrochloric acid and pepsin.

> ⑨ Gastric Juice (Chyme): Acidic fluid formed by mixing partially digested food with gastric juice, which passes through pylorus to duodenum.

⑸ Gastric Motility

> ① Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes continuously, forming acidic chyme.

> ② Pyloric sphincter muscle: Located between stomach and duodenum, and controls pyloric reflex.

>> ○ When closed: duodenal distension, increased acidity, increased fat, hypertonic solution → increased enterogastrone → long reflex, short reflex → inhibition of pyloric sphincter relaxation → maximization of digestive efficiency

>> ○ When opened: When the contents of the duodenum become alkaline (digestion in the duodenum is completed), the pylorus reflexively opens

>> ○ Regulation by enterogastrone (a collective term for small intestinal hormones)

>> ○ Long reflex: Increased sympathetic activity, decreased parasympathetic activity

>> ○ Short reflex: Involves the enteric nervous plexus

⑹ Three phases of gastric acid secretion control: Cephalic and intestinal parts of stomach are involved.

**Figure 3. Regulation of Gastric Acid Secretion, 3 Stages**

<br>

> ① The first active stage

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Stimulus: Amino acids in food stimulate G cells.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. G cells secrete gastrin.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Gastrin travels via blood to stimulate wall cells in stomach.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Wall cells secrete HCl to lower stomach pH.

> ② The second active stage

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Medulla oblongata stimulates vagus nerve.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Vagus nerve (parasympathetic) secretes acetylcholine to stimulate G cells and enterochromaffin-like cells.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Wall cells secrete HCl to lower stomach pH.

> ③ Inhibition stage

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. If stomach pH becomes too low, D cells are stimulated.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. D cells secrete somatostatin into blood.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Somatostatin travels via blood to stimulate wall cells.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Wall cells reduce gastrin secretion.

⑺ Helicobacter pylori

> ① Survives in very acidic conditions by secreting mucin that neutralizes acid.

> ② Since mucin cannot cover the stomach wall where this bacterium adheres, the wall becomes damaged and may develop into a gastric ulcer.

⑻ Stomach of ruminants

> ① Rumen: Symbiotic intestinal microorganisms synthesize cellulase.

> ② Reticulum: Symbiotic intestinal microorganisms synthesize cellulase.

> ③ Omasum: Absorbs water.

> ④ Abomasum: Carries out digestive functions.

<br>

<br>

## **4. Stage 3: Small Intestine**

⑴ **Small Intestine**

> ① Place where the hydrolysis of food polymers and absorption of nutrients mainly occur

> ② Peristalsis, segmentation, chemical digestion are all performed

>> ○ Peristalsis: Carried out by Cajal cells, as in the stomach.

> ③ Villi of the small intestine

<br>

<img width="811" height="339" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e4865f6-9503-480c-a56e-cc1109650fd2" />

**Figure. 4.** Villi of the Small Intestine

<br>

>> ○ Mucosal folds: The small intestine remains in a partially contracted state due to the longitudinal muscle, creating folds on the mucosal surface (×3)

>> ○ Villi: Magnification of each fold reveals finger-like projections called villi (×10)

>> ○ Microvilli: Located on the epithelial cells of the villi

>>> ○ Various hydrolytic enzymes are anchored and secreted at the brush border

>>> ○ On each villus, strands of the glycocalyx project outward (×20), with a total surface area of about 300 ㎡

>> ○ Intestinal villi projections: Maximize the absorptive surface area (×600)

> ④ Duodenum (25 cm)

>> ○ Intestinal juice: secreted from the intestinal glands in the small intestinal wall → finally breaks down carbohydrates and proteins into their basic units for absorption in the small intestine.

>>> ○ Enterokinase: present in the epithelial cell membrane of the small intestine

>>> ○ Trypsin: secreted from the pancreas as trypsinogen; activated to trypsin by enterokinase

>>> ○ Chymotrypsin: secreted from the pancreas as chymotrypsinogen; activated to chymotrypsin by trypsin

>>> ○ Carboxypeptidase: secreted from the pancreas as pro-carboxypeptidase; activated to carboxypeptidase by chymotrypsin

>>> ○ Maltase: maltose → glucose + glucose

>>> ○ Sucrase: sucrose → glucose + fructose

>>> ○ Lactase: lactose → glucose + galactose

>>> ○ (Di)aminopeptidase, dipeptidase, carboxypeptidase: polypeptides, tripeptides, dipeptides → amino acids

>>> ○ Nuclease: DNA, RNA → nucleotides

>> ○ Mucus: Maintains flexibility of the contents in the lumen (lubricant function)

>> ○ The site where acidic chyme mixes with digestive enzymes secreted from the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and the glands of the small intestine itself, allowing digestion to occur.

> ⑤ Jejunum and ileum (260 cm): absorption of nutrients and water

>> ○ Jejunum: secretes N-peptidase

>>> ○ N-peptidase: secreted in an active form from the beginning; an exopeptidase that recognizes and cleaves the amino terminus of proteins

>> ○ About 90% of water is absorbed in the small intestine

⑵ **Pancreas**

> ① Location: Large gland right below the stomach, having both endocrine and exocrine parts (connected to common bile duct, 1.5 L/day)

> ② Pancreatic juice secretion: Acidic food in the stomach → stimulation of the duodenal wall → secretion of secretin → enters the bloodstream → stimulates pancreatic cells → pancreatic juice secretion

>> ○ Secretin: Hormone that promotes pancreatic juice secretion

> ③ Digestive enzymes

>> ○ Amylase: Carbohydrate digestion enzyme

>> ○ Endopeptidase: Proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyzes internal peptide bonds, e.g., trypsin, chymotrypsin

>> ○ Exopeptidase: Proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyzes terminal peptide bonds, e.g., carboxypeptidase

>>> ○ N-peptidase secreted from the jejunum is also an exopeptidase

>> ○ [Trypsin](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1022): In the duodenum, enterokinase activates trypsinogen into trypsin

>> ○ [Chymotrypsin](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1022): In the duodenum, trypsin activates chymotrypsinogen into chymotrypsin

>> ○ [Carboxypeptidase](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1022): In the duodenum, chymotrypsin activates pro-carboxypeptidase into carboxypeptidase

>> ○ Fat-hydrolyzing enzyme: lipase

>> ○ Nucleic acid–hydrolyzing enzymes: RNase, DNase

>> ○ Elastase: Enzyme that breaks down elastin

> ④ Bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>): Secreted by ductal cells, it neutralizes the pH of chyme together with bile.

>> ○ Protection against gastric acid damage: Duodenal ulcers are 10 times more common than gastric ulcers

>> ○ Enzymes in the small intestine function optimally at neutral or slightly alkaline pH

>> ○ Transport of bicarbonate ions

>>> ○ Primary Active Transport: Sodium-potassium pump establishes a sodium ion concentration gradient

>>> ○ Secondary Active Transport: When hydrogen ions move from the secretory cells of the small intestine toward the blood, sodium ions move along

>>> ○ Secondary Active Transport: Chloride ions move along with sodium ions

>>> ○ Bicarbonate ions are transported by facilitated diffusion through a chloride ion cotransporter.

>> ○ Bile: Stored in the gallbladder

>>> ○ Synthesized from cholesterol (0.5 L/day)

>>> ○ Yellow-green liquid

>>> ○ Delivered to the gallbladder through the hepatic duct, then released into the duodenum via the common bile duct.

>>>> ○ The sphincter of the common bile duct relaxes during absorption and contracts after absorption.

>>> ○ Food stimulates the duodenal wall → secretion of cholecystokinin → enters the bloodstream → stimulates the gallbladder → secretion of bile

>>> ○ Main components: water, bile salts, bile acids, cholesterol, bile pigments

>>> ○ Characteristics of bile: Contains no digestive enzymes, aids in fat digestion, prevents food putrefaction, alkaline in nature.

>>> ○ About 85% of bile salts are reabsorbed in the ileum, and about 10% are reabsorbed in the colon.

>> ○ Bicarbonate ions: Neutralizes the hydrochloric acid that enters the small intestine from the stomach

> ④ Endocrine

>> ○ Secretion of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes cell division

>> ○ Activation of Vitamin D

>> ○ Angiotensinogen secretion: Regulates reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys

>> ○ Cytokine secretion

> ⑤ Blood Sugar Regulation

>> ○ During the fetal period, it also takes part in red blood cell production.

> ⑨ Elimination function

>> ○ Solid waste is expelled into the intestines through bile canaliculi

> ⑩ Detoxification: Mainly occurs in smooth endoplasmic reticulum

>> ○ Drug removal

>> ○ Removal of hydrogen peroxide by catalase

 ⑷ **Gallbladder** 

> ① Normally, bile is stored and then released when fat enters the duodenum

> ② Emulsification action

>> ○ Bile has both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties (amphiphilic)

>> ○ As a result, bile forms small micelle particles, increasing the exposed surface area to lipase

<br>

<img width="820" height="560" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f248a63-49ef-463a-b68a-24c760c43037" />

**Figure 8. Action of the Gallbladder**

<br>

> ③ Bile salt recirculation (95%): absorbed in the ileum (the distal part of the small intestine) and recirculated, while about 5% is lost in the feces.

> ④ Gallstones

>> ○ Components of bile, including bile acid salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids, exist in an insoluble, micellar state

>> ○ Excess cholesterol or precipitation of bile pigments → bile crystallizes, leading to gallstone formation.

>> ○ Gallstones are more common in females than males (influenced by sex hormones)

> ⑤ Jaundice

>> ○ Bile duct obstruction: accumulation of bilirubin in the blood causes yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)

>> ○ Hemolytic jaundice: occurs when liver disease leads to red blood cell destruction or when bilirubin secretion into the gallbladder is abnormal

 ⑸ Regulation by Enterogastrones: Occurs in the duodenum

<br>

<img width="484" height="363" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3227af43-bec4-4559-8c2a-2ed625665a52" />

**Figure 9.** Regulation by Enterogastrones

<br>

> ① Secretin: Responds to acidity, stimulates pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, neutralizes gastric acid, and inhibits gastrin secretion

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Acidic chyme from the stomach stimulates cells in the duodenal wall: Secretin secretion from the duodenal wall cells into the blood

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. Secretin circulates in bloodstream and stimulates the gastric wall → decreases gastric acid secretion

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Secretin stimulates the pancreas → promotes secretion of pancreatic juice rich in bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) → neutralizes acidic chyme.

>>> ○ H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> are expelled from the liver interstitial fluid into the blood → lowers blood pH

>>> ○ Stomach raises blood pH, offsetting the decreased pH in the duodenum

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Closure of the pyloric sphincter → prevents further entry of acidic chyme from the stomach into the duodenum

> ② Cholecystokinin (CCK): Responds to fats. Stimulates pancreatic and bile secretion for fat digestion

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Fatty acids from the stomach stimulate cells in the duodenal wall

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. CCK is secreted into the blood from cells in the duodenal wall

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. CCK stimulates the gastric wall → decreases gastric acid secretion

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. CCK stimulates the pancreas → increases secretion of pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. CCK stimulates the gallbladder → bile secretion → emulsification of fats

> ③ GIP, VIP, GLP-1: Respond to high osmolarity in the small intestine due to sugars and fats, and inhibit gastric acid secretion

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Chyme from the stomach stimulates cells in the duodenal wall

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. GIP is secreted into the blood from cells in the duodenal wall

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 1<sup>st</sup>. GIP stimulates the gastric wall → decreases gastric juice secretion

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. GIP stimulates the intestinal glands → promotes intestinal juice secretion.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup>. GIP stimulates the pancreas → stimulates insulin secretion

 ⑹ Regulation of digestive functions by the enteric nervous plexus

<br>

<img width="820" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f04a340c-30bc-4831-a24b-04d01b4b0fcf" />

**Figure 10. Regulation by the Enteric Nervous System**

<br>

> ① Basically, the regulation of digestion is controlled by the medulla oblongata, the center of the autonomic nervous system.

> ② Conditioned reflex: Influenced by the cerebrum, occurs when there is prior experience.

> ③ Unconditioned reflex: When food exerts pressure on the stomach wall, causing stomach distension.

>> ○ Sensory nerve → medulla oblongata → vagus nerve → stimulation of chief cells and parietal cells → secretion of gastric juice

>> ○ Sensory nerve → medulla oblongata → vagus nerve → stimulation of G cells → secretion of gastrin

<br>

<br>

## **5. Stage 4: Large Intestine** 

 ⑴ Composition: Colon, Cecum, Rectum

> ① Colon

>> ○ About 1.5 m

>> ○ Site of water and ion absorption, formation of semisolid stools from undigested material

>> ○ About 7 L of fluid secreted into the digestive tract daily, with about 90% reabsorbed

>> ○ No active transport mechanism for water → water reabsorption induced by osmotic pressure created by pumping ions (like salt) out of the lumen

>> ○ Connected to the small intestine at the T-shaped junction leading to the cecum.

> ② Cecum

>> ○ Not involved in digestion

>> ○ Appendix is involved related to the immune system

>>> ○ Appendix: Protrudes from the cecum in a finger-like shape, partially involved in immune responses

>> ○ Herbivores possess special chambers, including the cecum, within their digestive tract where numerous symbiotic microorganisms reside to digest cellulose.

> ③ Rectum

>> ○ Site where feces are stored until elimination

>> ○ End part of the colon

>> ○ Two sphincters between the colon and anus: one is involuntary, and the other is voluntary

 ⑵ Intestinal Microbiota

> ① There are approximately 100 trillion intestinal bacteria, about the same number as the body's cells

> ② Because of the significant number of intestinal bacteria, about 70% of the body's immune cells are present in the intestines

> ③ Types

>> ○ Harmful bacteria

>> ○ Beneficial bacteria

>> ○ Intermediate bacteria: Act in ways similar to both beneficial and harmful bacteria

> ④ **Example 1:** E. coli (Escherichia coli)

>> ○ Produces Vitamin K, Vitamin B7 (biotin), and Vitamin B9 (folic acid), leading to vitamin deficiencies if antibiotics are overused

>> ○ Engages in anaerobic metabolic reactions, producing methane and hydrogen sulfide gases as byproducts

>> ○ Accounts for one-third of the weight of feces, excluding water

>> ○ E. coli found in lakes and rivers serves as an indicator of pollution from untreated sewage

>> ○ E. coli O157 is a harmful strain of E. coli

> ⑤ **Example 2:** Lactic acid bacteria

⑶ Sphincter: Two exist between the colon and anus

> ① Internal Anal Sphincter: Involuntary muscle

> ② External Anal Sphincter: Voluntary muscle

⑷ Defecation

> ① Defecation: Spinal reflex related to rectal wall distension, reflex begins when feces enter the empty rectum

> ② Diarrhea: Caused by lower digestive tract infection and nerve stimulation, leads to dehydration, disturbance in cardiac contraction due to blood electrolyte imbalance

> ③ Constipation: Dietary fiber (e.g., cellulose) intake helps prevent constipation

> ④ Flatulence: Ammonia, methane gas, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, benzophenone, skatole (odor-causing substances)

> ⑤ A significant portion of feces consists of bacteria, fecal color is due to bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells

⑸ Lactose intolerance

**Figure 11.** Absorption of Nutrients

<br>

⑴ Most nutrients are absorbed through the mucosa of the small intestine and transported via blood vessels and lymphatic vessels in the submucosal tissue

> ① Intestinal mucosal cells are connected by desmosomes and tight junctions: prevent digestive products from moving through intercellular gaps and block membrane protein migration

> ② Absorption in the stomach: alcohol and small amounts of drugs

> ③ Absorption in the large intestine: water and inorganic salts

⑵ Amino acids, monosaccharides: Secondary active transport with Na<sup>+</sup>

<br>

<img width="507" height="465" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98cda77b-cabc-4388-aac1-0af7f1a00974" />

**Figure 12.** Absorption of Amino Acids, Monosaccharides

<br>

> ① Unlike glucose, fructose is absorbed via facilitated diffusion from the first time.

> ② Small intestine villus capillaries **→** Hepatic portal vein **→** Liver **→** Hepatic vein **→** Inferior vena cava **→** Right atrium **→** Whole body

>> ○ The hepatic portal vein and the hepatic artery, which carries blood directly from the heart to the liver, are completely different.

>> ○ Various metabolic functions in the liver: regulation of blood glucose levels

>> ○ Removal of harmful substances before blood circulates through the body.

>> ○ Water-soluble nutrients such as monosaccharides, amino acids, minerals, and water-soluble vitamins are mainly absorbed into the capillaries of the small intestine.

> ③ Amino acids vs. dipeptides, tripeptides

>> ○ Amino acids: Absorbed into small intestine epithelial cells through co-transport with sodium

>> ○ Dipeptides, tripeptides: Absorbed into small intestine epithelial cells through co-transport with hydrogen ions

⑶ Lipids: Absorbed via diffusion

<br>

<img width="500" height="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24ae9025-977d-43c3-b0cb-da4dfeb936af" />

**Figure 13.** Absorption of Lipids

<br>

> ① Absorption of lipids

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Emulsification: Bile salts emulsify fat globules into fat particles

>>> ○ Bile salts are synthesized in the liver

>>> ○ Bile salts act as surfactants to promote emulsification

>>> ○ Bile salts are recycled

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Lipase activity: lipase secreted from the pancreas breaks down micelles into monoglycerides and free fatty acids.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Lipid absorption: Monoglycerides, free fatty acids are absorbed via diffusion

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Lipid synthesis: Monoglycerides are resynthesized into triglycerides by enzymes in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Chylomicrons: Expelled through vesicles in a form bound with cholesterol and proteins, allowing them to move into the plasma.

>>> ○ Chylomicrons are water-soluble

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Chylomicrons are excreted by vesicles.

>> ○ 7<sup>th</sup>. Chylomicrons are transported to lacteals in the center of villi since they are too large to pass through capillaries

>>> ○ Lacteals are part of the lymphatic system

>> ○ Free fatty acids are utilized in cellular respiration after beta-oxidation

>> ○ Can also be absorbed as diglycerides in the small intestine villi

> ② Lacteals **→** Lymphatic vessels **→** Thoracic duct **→** Left subclavian vein **→** Superior vena cava **→** Right atrium **→** Whole body

>> ○ Lipids, glycerol, fat-soluble vitamins, cholesterol, etc., are primarily absorbed through lacteals

>> ○ Serum albumin assists in the movement of fatty acids in the blood

> ③ Lipoprotein: A particle in which lipids are enclosed at the core and surrounded by proteins, making it soluble in water.

>> ○ Lipids themselves are not soluble in water, so they must form complexes with proteins to move in the bloodstream

>> ○ Components: Apolipoproteins (Apo), phospholipids, cholesterol, triacylglycerol, proteins

>> ○ Types of lipoproteins

<br>

**Figure 14.** Types of Lipoproteins

<br>

>> ○ **Type 1:** Chylomicron

>>> ○ Largest

>>> ○ **Function 1:** Produced from fats and delivers fat to the liver, skeletal muscle, and lacteals.

>>> ○ **Function 2:** Regulate lipolysis enzyme activity.

>>> ○ Contains the highest amount of triglycerides.

>>> ○ Major Apo lipoproteins: B-48, ApoC, ApoE

>>> ○ Core lipid: dietary triglycerides

>>> ○ Synthesized in: Intestines

>> ○ **Type 2:** Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)

>>> ○ **Function 1:** Delivers fats from the liver to various tissues via blood circulation, and transports 60% of blood cholesterol

>>> ○ **Function 2:** Receptor-mediated endocytosis

>>> ○ Contains the highest amount of cholesterol

>>> ○ Directly associated with atherosclerosis, thus often referred to as "bad cholesterol"

>>> ○ A distinguishing feature is the presence of ApoB-100 and ApoE proteins on the surface: LDL receptors recognize ApoB-100.

>>> ○ Core lipid: endogenous cholesterol ester

>>> ○ LDL primarily targets the endothelial cells of vascular tissue.

>>> ○ Synthesized in Liver.

>> ○ **Type 3:** High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)

>>> ○ Collects fats from tissues and cells, delivers them to the liver for excretion via bile

>>> ○ Involved in cholesterol removal, thus often referred to as "good cholesterol"

>>> ○ Highest density

>>> ○ Core lipid: endogenous cholesterol ester

>>> ○ Synthesized in liver and intestines.

>> ○ **Type 4:** Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), Intermediate Density Lipoprotein (IDL)

>>> ○ Intermediate forms between chylomicrons and LDL

>>> ○ Major Apo lipoproteins: ApoB-100, ApoC, ApoE

>>> ○ Function: Regulate lipolysis enzyme activity

>>> ○ Core lipid: endogenous triglycerides

>>> ○ Synthesized in liver.

>> ○ LDL/HDL ratio: High ratio linked to atherosclerosis. 3.5 is the normal value.

>> ○ Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)

>>> ○ A genetic disorder caused by an autosomal mutation.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>: Because LDL receptors are absent, abnormalities occur in IDL intake

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>: LDL accumulates in the blood and becomes oxidized into oxLDL

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>: Macrophages uptake oxLDL and become foam cells

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>: Foam cells form plaques in blood vessels, leading to arteriosclerosis

>>> ○ From birth, blood cholesterol levels are elevated, and cardiovascular diseases develop at an early age

>>> ○ Increased blood LDL leads to increased LDL uptake by hepatocytes, resulting in increased ApoB production

>>> ○ Plasma LDL cholesterol levels are about four times higher than in normal individuals

>>> ○ Causes atherosclerosis

>>> ○ Most patients die before the age of 20
 
 ⑷ Minerals: Active transport

> ① Examples: Sodium transporters, calcium transporters, iron transporters

> ② Absorption of cobalamin (Vitamin B12)

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Separation of "Vitamin B12 + haptocorrin complex" by stomach's pepsin

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Separation of Vitamin B12 and haptocorrin by pancreatic enzymes

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Secretion of intrinsic factor by stomach wall cells

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Binding of Vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor in the duodenum

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Uptake of "Vitamin B12 + intrinsic factor" by receptor-mediated endocytosis in the ileum terminal: ATP required
 
⑸ Vitamin: Active transport

⑹ Water: About 90% is absorbed in the small intestine and colon (part of the large intestine)

⑺ Junctions of the small intestine epithelial cells

> ① Tight junctions: Prevent substances from moving between the lumen and blood vessels just beneath the villi

> ② Adherens junctions (anchoring junctions): Desmosomes and hemidesmosomes maintain strong cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion through intermediate filaments

> ③ Gap junctions: Allow the movement of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells

<br>

## **7. Regulation of Appetite Hormones**

⑴ Overview

> ① Appetite-regulating hormones all act on neuropeptide Y

> ② Neuropeptide Y induces overeating

⑵ Leptin

> ① Produced by fat cells

> ② Increased fat tissue leads to higher concentration of fats in the blood, suppressing appetite in the brain

> ③ **Leptin experiments**

>> ○ _Ob_ protein: Leptin protein

>> ○ _Db_ protein: Cell membrane receptors in the appetite-regulating center for leptin.

>> ○ _ob/ob_ mice: Become obese due to lack of leptin secretion from fat cells

>> ○ _db/db_ mice: Produce more leptin than normal mice but their brain's leptin receptors don't function, leading to obesity

>> ○ Application: Can connect blood vessels of two mice and observe phenotypic changes after a certain time

>> ○ Example: _ob_ / _ob_ , _Db_ / _Db_ × _Ob_ / _Ob_ , _db_ / _db_: _ob_ / _ob_ , _Db_ / _Db_ mice return to normal while _Ob_ / _Ob_ , _db_ / _db_ mice remain obese

⑶ PYY

> ① Produced in the small intestine after a meal

> ② Acts as an appetite suppressant, opposite to ghrelin

⑷ Insulin

> ① Secreted by the pancreas

> ② Acts on the brain to suppress appetite

⑸ Cholecystokinin (CCK)

> ① Hormone secreted when food enters the duodenum

> ② **Function 1:** Appetite suppression: Acts on the axon terminals of the vagus nerve to send satiety (fullness) signals to the brain.

> ③ **Function 2:** Inhibition of gastric juice secretion

> ④ **Function 3:** Stimulation of digestive enzyme secretion

> ⑤ **Function 4:** Stimulation of bile secretion

⑹ Ghrelin

> ① Secreted from the stomach wall, stimulates appetite

> ② One of the signals that induces the sensation of hunger as mealtime approaches.

> ③ Concentration increases in people undergoing weight loss and dieting, leading to hunger

## **8. Digestive System Disorders **

⑴ **Obesity**

> ① Assessment of healthy body fat

>> ○ Overweight: Definition varies by era and culture

>> ○ Women require more body fat than men for reproductive purposes

>>> ○ Women: 22% (12 ~ 32 %)

>>> ○ Men: 14 % (3 ~ 29%)

>> ○ The larger the body frame and the older the age, the greater the increase in body fat.

>> ○ Body Mass Index (BMI): Weight (kg) ÷ (Height(m))^2. Imperfect criterion

>>> ○ Underweight: Below 18.5

>>> ○ Normal: 18.5 ~ 24.9

>>> ○ Overweight: 25.0 ~ 29.9

>>> ○ Obesity: 30 or above

> ② Causes of obesity: Lifestyle and genetics both influence obesity

> ③ Classification of obesity according to adipocyte type

>> ○ **Adipocyte hyperplasia type:** the size of adipocytes is normal, but the number of adipocytes increases

>>> ○ Even with weight reduction, the increased number of adipocytes does not decrease

>>> ○ As a result, it is prone to relapse and often leads to moderate to severe obesity

>> ○ **Adipocyte hypertrophy type:** the number of adipocytes is normal, but the size of adipocytes increases

>>> ○ When weight is reduced, the size of adipocytes decreases

>>> ○ Obesity in adults: usually adipocyte hypertrophy type

>> ○ **Mixed type:** both the number and the size of adipocytes increase

>>> ○ Even with weight reduction, the increased number of adipocytes does not decrease

>>> ○ As a result, it is prone to relapse and often leads to moderate to severe obesity

>>> ○ Obesity in children and adolescents: usually the mixed type

> ④ Subcutaneous fat

>> ○ Location where fat is stored for the first time.

>> ○ When the subcutaneous space becomes insufficient, fat accumulates in the abdomen and internal organs → abdominal fat, visceral fat, and fatty liver.

>> ○ Increased risk of metabolic complications

> ⑤ Related complications

>> ○ [Diabetes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/89#:~:text=%E2%91%A3-,%EB%8B%B9%EB%87%A8%EB%B3%91,-\(diabetes%20mellitus\))

>>> ○ Insulin: Hormone produced by pancreatic beta cells, promotes absorption of glucose by other cells

>>> ○ Type 1 Diabetes (Insulin-dependent): Unrelated to obesity, genetically absence of pancreatic beta cells, no insulin production

>>> ○ Type 2 Diabetes (Insulin-independent): Insulin resistance, related to obesity, common in adults, managed through diet and exercise

>> ○ [High Blood Pressure](https://jb243.github.io/pages/83): Elevated blood pressure

>>> ○ Systolic: Blood pressure when the heart contracts

>>> ○ Diastolic: Blood pressure when the heart relaxes

>>> ○ Normal Blood Pressure: 120/80

>>> ○ High Blood Pressure: Consistently 140/90 or higher

>> ○ Heart attack: Sudden blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle due to obstruction of a coronary artery.

>> ○ Stroke (Seizure): Sudden blockage of brain blood flow due to cerebral artery obstruction or rupture

 ⑵ **Atherosclerosis**

> ① Cholesterol: Constituent of cell membranes, precursor to steroid hormones

>> ○ LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein): Synthesized in the liver, transports cholesterol from food to tissues

>> ○ HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein): Transports cholesterol from tissues to the liver (for excretion in bile)

> ② Cholesterol is carried in the blood by lipoproteins, and accumulation in arteries leads to atherosclerosis

 ⑶ **Appetite Regulation Disorders**

> ① Anorexia nervosa

>> ○ Self-induced starvation, an eating disorder driven by weight consciousness

>> ○ Can lead to starvation of the heart muscle and cause irregular heartbeat

>> ○ Suppresses estrogen, resulting in cessation of menstruation and risk of infertility

>> ○ Increases risk of osteoporosis

> ② Bulimia nervosa

>> ○ Binge eating followed by laxative use

>> ○ Risk of gastric rupture, dental and gum damage from stomach acid, and dehydration

 ⑷ **Nutritional Imbalance**

> ① Undernutrition

>> ○ A chronic lack of caloric intake, resulting in a continuous shortage of necessary chemical energy supply

>> ○ Breakdown of stored glycogen, fat, and protein → muscle mass decreases and protein deficiency occurs in the brain

>> ○ Example: In sub-Saharan Africa, where drought, war, and AIDS epidemics persist, about 200 million people cannot obtain sufficient nutrition

>> ○ Example: Anorexia nervosa (obsessive fasting)

> ② Overnutrition

>> ○ When food intake exceeds an animal's energy requirements, the three main nutrients (i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, fats) are stored as glycogen or body fat

>> ○ Important for hibernating animals

> ③ Malnutrition

>> ○ A state in which one or more essential nutrients are lacking

>> ○ **Example 1:** Vitamin A deficiency → solved by supplying beta-carotene (e.g., Golden Rice)

>> ○ **Example 2:** When herbivores eat plants grown in phosphorus-deficient soil → bones break easily

>> ○ **Example 3:** Diet lacking sufficient essential amino acids → protein deficiency disorders

> ④ Kwashiorkor: severe protein deficiency caused by extreme starvation

>> ○ Albumin is used as an energy source → increase in water content of tissue cells → edema develops

>> ○ Carbohydrates → acetyl-CoA → fatty acid synthesis

>> ○ Symptoms:

>>> ○ Muscle wasting

>>> ○ Growth retardation

>>> ○ Neurological disorders

>>> ○ Digestive problems

>>> ○ Twisting of hands and feet

>>> ○ Skin lesions

>>> ○ Hair becomes brown and stops growing

>>> ○ Edema
