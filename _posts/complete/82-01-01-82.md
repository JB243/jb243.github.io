## **1. Key Steps in Food Processing**

 ⑴ Four main steps

> ① Ingestion **:** The act of eating

>> ○ Suspension feeders **:** Animals that eat suspended particles in liquids (e.g., baleen whales)

>> ○ Substrate feeders **:** Animals that eat their environment (substrate) (e.g., dung beetles, maggots)

>> ○ Fluid feeders **:** Animals that feed on bodily fluids (e.g., mosquitoes)

>> ○ Bulk feeders **:** Animals that consume relatively large food pieces (e.g., silk worms)

> ② Digestion **:** The process of breaking down food into small molecules that can be absorbed by the body

>> ○ Peristalsis (mechanical digestion) **:** Wave-like contractions of smooth muscles in the digestive tract that propel food

>> ○ Segmentation (mechanical digestion) **:** Contraction of smooth muscles that breaks down larger food particles

>> ○ Chemical digestion **:** Enzymatic breakdown of polymers into monomers

> ③ Absorption **:** The process of absorbing amino acids, monosaccharides, etc.

> ④ Excretion and Elimination **:** The process of expelling undigested materials from the digestive tract

> ⑤ Why polymers can't be used directly

>> ○ Cellular absorption **:** Polymers can't pass through cell membranes

>> ○ Species specificity

>>> ○ Polymers in animals' bodies don't match those in food

>>> ○ However, all organisms use the same monomers to build their own polymers

>> ○ Immune response

 ⑵ Classification of Digestion by Digestive Compartment

> ① Digestive compartments **:** Specialized compartments for digestion to reduce self-digestion risk

> ② Intracellular digestion

>> ○ Phagosome **:** Simplest digestive compartment, where digestion occurs after fusion with lysosomes

>> ○ Endocytosis, Exocytosis

>> ○ Marine animals **:** Digest food via intracellular digestion

> ③ Extracellular digestion

>> ○ Occurs in compartments continuously connected to the external environment

>> ○ Can digest larger food particles compared to intracellular digestion

>> ○ Gastrovascular cavity

>>> ○ Performs digestion and distribution of nutrients to the entire body

>>> ○ Observed in cnidarians

>>> ○ Hydra, secretes digestive enzymes in the gastrovascular wall

>>> ○ Undigested materials exit through a single opening that serves as both mouth and anus

>> ○ Complete digestive tract, alimentary canal

>>> ○ Food moves in one direction

>>> ○ Allows step-by-step digestion and absorption

>>> ○ Can eat new food before previously eaten food is completely digested

 ⑶ Tissue Layers of Vertebrate Digestive Tract

> ① Structure **:** Mucosa, Submucosa, Submucosal Plexus, Two Layers of Smooth Muscle Cells, Serosa

> ② Digestive tract usually has a contractile longitudinal muscle layer and a relaxant circular muscle layer, increasing surface area

> ③ Internal circular muscle **:** Segmentation, prevents backflow

> ④ External longitudinal muscle **:** Peristalsis

## **2. Step 1: Oral Cavity, Pharynx, Esophagus**

 ⑴ **Teeth:** Mastication (mechanical digestion)

> ① Carnivores **:** Well-developed sharp incisors and canines, pointed small premolars and molars for breaking and cutting food

> ② Herbivores **:** Broad, flat teeth with a wide grinding surface for chewing tough plants

> ③ Omnivores **:** Less specialized dentition

> ④ Human Teeth **:** Enamel layer, dentin layer, pulp cavity

 ⑵ Saliva

> ① Secreted by salivary glands even before eating through reflexes or conditioning

> ② Salivary Glands

>> ○ Salivary amylase secreted from acinar cells

>> ○ Three pairs: sublingual, submandibular, parotid glands

>> ○ Pathway of salivary secretion **:** Food → Taste receptors on the tongue → Sensory nerves → Salivary nuclei → Motor nerves → Salivary secretion

> ③ Components of Saliva

>> ○ Provides moisture to food

>> ○ Mucin **:** Acts as a lubricant, making food slippery for easy swallowing

>> ○ Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) **:** Neutralizes oral acidity (buffer) **→** Prevents tooth decay

>> ○ Lysozyme

>>> ○ Breaks β 1→4 linkage of peptidoglycan

>>> ○ Peptidoglycan is a major component of bacterial cell walls

>> ○ **Amylase**

>>> ○ Converts polysaccharides (no taste) → maltose (sweet taste)

>>> ○ Irregular hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages in starch into maltose and dextrins

>> ○ Fatty acids **:** Make saliva slightly acidic, inhibits bacterial growth

>> ○ Lingual lipase

>>> ○ In infants, helps digest fats as their digestive enzymes are immature

>> ○ [IgA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/86) **:** Antibodies that remove parasites, etc.

> ④ Regulation of Saliva Secretion

>> ○ Controlled by the autonomic nervous system in the medulla

>> ○ Sympathetic nervous system inhibits saliva secretion, parasympathetic nervous system stimulates it

>> ○ Sympathetic nervous system's inhibition increases saliva viscosity

 ⑶ **Process of Swallowing Food**

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. When food is not being swallowed **:** Contraction of esophageal sphincters, elevation of epiglottis **→** Opening of airway, closure of esophagus

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Bolus of food reaches the pharynx, triggering the swallowing reflex (deglutition reflex)

>> ○ Epiglottis **:** Upper part of the respiratory tract

>> ○ Epiglottis moves upward, tipping epiglottis over the glottis (closing the airway) **→** Epiglottic lid closes the glottis (closure of airway)

>> ○ Relaxation of esophageal sphincter **→** Opening of esophagus

>> ○ Controlled by the medulla

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Food enters the esophagus, the larynx moves downward, and the glottis opens

>> ○ Uvula rises to prevent food from going backward

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Peristaltic wave (contraction) of muscles moves the bolus downward to reach the stomach

 ⑷ **Esophagus:** Peristalsis, Segmentation, Mucus (lubrication)

> ① Upper Esophageal Sphincter (= Upper Esophageal Muscle) **:** Striated muscle, initiated by deglutition reflex

> ② Lower Esophageal Sphincter (= Lower Esophageal Muscle, Cardiac Sphincter) **:** Smooth muscle, peristalsis

>> ○ Below diaphragm, regulated under similar abdominal pressure as stomach

>> ○ Prevents food from regurgitating into the esophagus

>> ○ Normally closed; when stimulated by food, the lower esophagus reflexively opens

>> ○ In late pregnancy, increased abdominal pressure due to displacement of the abdominal cavity (toward thoracic cavity) often causes lower esophagus to open

>> ○ Heartburn **:** Dysregulation of lower esophageal muscle control **→** Acid reflux damages the esophagus **→** Ulceration

>> ○ Vomiting

>>> ○ Vomiting center in the medulla

>>> ○ Innate protective function against toxic substances

>>> ○ Triggered by stomach expansion, intestinal wall, chemical receptors in the brain, rotation of the head

>>> ○ As exit is blocked and entrance is relaxed, food is pushed backward

>>> ○ Vomiting not only damages the esophagus but also increases stomach pH, inhibiting proper digestion

> ⑸ Gastric Motility

> ① Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes continuously, forming acidic chyme.

> ② Pyloric sphincter muscle **:** Located between stomach and duodenum, controls pyloric reflex.

>> ○ **Closed case:** Expansion of duodenum, ↑ acidity, ↑ fat, ↑ cholecystokinin, long reflex, short reflex
**→** Inhibition of pyloric sphincter muscle relaxation **→** Maximizes digestion efficiency.

>> ○ **Open case:** When contents of duodenum become alkaline (after digestion in duodenum), pylorus reflexively opens.

>> ○ Regulated by enterogastrones (general term for intestinal hormones).

>> ○ Long reflex **:** Sympathetic nervous system ↑, parasympathetic nervous system ↓.

>> ○ Short reflex **:** Involves enteric nervous system.
