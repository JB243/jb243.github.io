## 1. Circulatory System

⑴ Types of Circulatory Systems

> ① Open Circulatory System

>> ○ **Organisms**: Arthropods and mollusks

>> ○ **Simplicity**: No capillaries; no clear distinction between hemolymph and interstitial fluid

>> ○ **Efficiency**: Low hydraulic pressure saves energy; no need to form capillary networks, making it easier to build and maintain the circulatory system

> ② **Closed Circulatory System**

>> ○ **Organisms**: Annelids, cephalopods, vertebrates, and other large or highly mobile organisms

>> ○ **Complexity**: Presence of capillaries creates a distinction between blood and interstitial fluid

>> ○ **Efficiency**: High hydraulic pressure allows efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients; osmotic pressure is maintained by large molecules in the blood, helping to regulate blood pressure

⑵ Circulatory System in Vertebrates (Cardiovascular System) – Closed Circulatory System

> ① Animals with high metabolic rates possess more complex blood vessels and a more powerful heart compared to those with lower metabolic rates

> ② The complexity and distribution of blood vessels in an organism are proportional to the metabolic activity of each organ

> ③ **Fish (1 atrium, 1 ventricle)** – *Single Circulation*

>> ○ No separation between systemic and pulmonary circulation; blood must pass through two capillary beds before returning to the heart, limiting blood flow speed.

>> ○ Maintains necessary blood flow via skeletal muscle activity.

>> ○ Only deoxygenated blood flows through the heart.

> ④ **Amphibians (2 atria, 1 ventricle)** – *Double Circulation*

>> ○ Systemic and pulmonary circulations are separated, allowing more blood supply to the brain and muscles; however, mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood reduces efficiency

>> ○ To compensate for lower oxygen efficiency, a cutaneous circulation system is developed

> ⑤ **Reptiles (2 atria, partially divided 2 ventricles)** – *Double Circulation*

>> ○ Less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood improves the efficiency of material exchange

> ⑥ **Birds and Mammals (2 atria, fully divided 2 ventricles)** – *Double Circulation*

>> ○ Complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood enables efficient material exchange

>> ○ This system supports endothermic animals, which consume approximately 10 times more energy than ectotherms of the same size

> ⑦ **Human Circulatory System**

>> ○ **Systemic circulation**: Left ventricle → Aorta → Whole body (capillaries) → Vena cava → Right atrium

>> ○ **Pulmonary circulation**: Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs (capillaries) → Pulmonary vein → Left atrium

<br>

## **2\. Blood composition and function**

⑴ Blood centrifugation: Separate blood by component

> ① Centrifugation with Anticoagulant: Separated red blood cells, soft layers, and plasma from below to top

>> ○ Soft layer (buffy coat): leucocytes + platelets

>> ○ Plasma: Liquid composition of blood

> ② Centrifugation without anticoagulant: Separated into blood clots and serum from below to top

>> ○ Blood clot: Ingredients of coagulated blood, red blood cells + leucocytes + platelets + blood coagulation factors

>> ○ Serum: Liquid components remaining after blood clotting, removal of fibrinogen and other components from plasma

>> ○ Cellular elements are entangled by fibrinogen in plasma

> ③ Erythrocyte volume fraction (hematocrit): Ratio of red blood cell volume to total blood volume

>> ○ Normal adult man: 0.41 to 0.51

>> ○ Normal adult woman: 0.36 to 0.45

>> ○ Why men use power more than women

>> ○ Anemic people have small hematocrit

>> ○ Viscosity is proportional to erythrocyte volume fraction

## **3\. Circulatory system and heart**

⑴ Structure of the heart

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/94yRP/btrzYDQYq43/VFUNm4zqY7YBHpaghg8uXK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 6.</b> Structure of the heart

<br>

> ① The heart is located beneath the sternum and is about the size of a fist, mostly composed of cardiac muscle.

> ② It consists of the atrium, which receives blood, and the ventricle, which delivers blood: two atria and two ventricles for human.

> ③ The ventricles have a thicker muscle layer than the atria and have a stronger contractile force.

>> ○ In particular, the left ventricle contracts with much stronger force, sending blood to each organ in the body

>> ○ The left ventricle contracts more powerfully than the right ventricle, but the same amount of blood is released in one contraction

> ④ Valve: Four valves in the heart prevent blood from flowing back

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/c9mjGf/btrzZ329Ysi/zKkl10nqsKBT9cWpTDPuSk/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 7.</b> Valve structure

<br>

>> ○ Atrioventricular valve: Between the atria and the ventricles, tricuspid and bicuspid

>> ○ Meniscus valve: Between the ventricle and the artery

>> ○ Abnormal sound (heart noise) occurs when blood is ejected through an incomplete valve when the valve is abnormal

⑵ Heart muscle

> ① Characteristic

>> ○ High density of capillaries and mitochondria: Aerobic respiration 

>> ○ Red due to high myoglobin content

>> ○ Nutrition: Fatty acids ≫ Glucose, lactic acid (∴ aerobic respiration only)

>> ○ Coronary artery: Blood supply to heart muscle, lack of blood supply to heart muscle causes cardiac arrest, heart attack, myocardial infarction

> ② Pacemaker Potential of Autorhythmic Cells

>> ○ Autorhythmic cells: Sinoatrial (SA) node (located in the right atrium), Atrioventricular (AV) node (located in the right atrium), Purkinje fibers

>>> ○ [SA node](https://jb243.github.io/pages/88#4-model-of-cardiac-muscle-contraction): Generates pacemaker potentials without external electrical signals

>>> ○ AV node and Purkinje fibers: Amplify potentials when they receive external electrical signals

>> ○ The SA node shortens the diastolic period and increases heart rate under sympathetic stimulation

>> ○ The SA node lengthens the diastolic period and decreases heart rate under parasympathetic stimulation

>> ○ The autonomic nerve that acts on the SA node is a branch of the vagus nerve (vagus n.)

> ③ [Plateau Potential of Ventricular Myocardium](https://jb243.github.io/pages/88#4-model-of-cardiac-muscle-contraction)

>> ○ Ventricular myocardium is influenced only by the sympathetic nervous system, which regulates stroke volume

> ④ [Contraction Mechanism of Ventricular Myocardium](https://jb243.github.io/pages/88#4-model-of-cardiac-muscle-contraction)

⑶ Cardiac cycle: How the heart pumps and receives blood

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/vkVM6/btrzYBZUg6Y/YYOzChk9DQvwfkOjeVxzKk/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 8.</b> Cardiac cycle

<br>

> ① Pulse: Changes in blood vessels according to the cardiac cycle

> ② Systolic: Blood flow in the ventricles → arteries

> ③ Diastolic: Blood flow atrium → ventricles

> ④ Atrium, Ventricular Relaxation: Intravenous → Atrium → Ventricular. Bicuspids and tricuspids open. Meniscal valve closed (0.4 seconds)

> ⑤ Atrial contraction, ventricular relaxation: Atrial blood → ventricles, Bicuspids and tricuspids open, meniscus closed (0.1 second)

> ⑥ The delayed time (0.1 seconds) that prevents the atria and ventricles from contracting simultaneously originates from the atrioventricular (AV) delay.

> ⑦ Delayed time so that the atria and the ventricles do not contract at the same time (0.1 second) is due to the atrioventricular delay

> ⑧ Cardiac arrest

>> ○ Cardiac arrest due to synchronization failure, fibrillation, arrhythmia

>> ○ Synchronization by electric shock (re-defibrillation)

⑷ Electrocardiography (ECG)

> ① Summary

>> ○ It represents the heartbeat as electrical signals and does not involve attaching electrodes directly to the heart; it is typically measured using 12 electrodes.

>> ○ Divided into waves and segments

>> ○ Wave: If it goes up above the baseline and then goes down

>> ○ Segment: Baseline between two waves

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bLCIfs/btrz3kv5JmK/BN8xcREE9huXj9g1PbkKG0/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 9.</b> Electrocardiogram

<br>

>> ○ [Understanding ECG signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIZQRjkwV9Q): Measures whether the electric field direction of the external electrodes aligns with the electric field direction within the heart.

> ② P wave: Depolarization of the SA node

>> ○ Sinoatrial node (SA node): Tissue that voluntarily generates action potentials

>> ○ A signal from the sinoatrial (SA) node causes atrial depolarization, leading to atrial contraction within 100 ms.

>> ○ Initial state of valve: Atrioventricular valve open, meniscus valve closed

>> ○ All cardiac muscle cells in the atria are connected by gap junctions, allowing the electrical signal from the sinoatrial (SA) node to rapidly spread throughout the entire atria.

> ③ P-Q interval: Atrioventricular (AV) Delay

>> ○ AV delay: A delay of approximately 0.1 seconds in the action potential at the AV node, allowing time for blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles

>> ○ Atrioventricular (AV) node

>>> ○ Gap junction pathway between the atria and ventricles

>>> ○ A pacemaker that receives signals from the SA node and generates fibrillation, synchronized with the SA node

> ④ Q point: The action potential reaches the bundle of His.

> ⑤ QRS Complex: Depolarization of the bundle of His and Purkinje fibers, i.e., ventricular depolarization

>> ○ The bundle of His and Purkinje fibers are also considered pacemakers.

>> ○ Depolarization of the Purkinje fibers → Ventricular depolarization → Triggers ventricular contraction.

>> ○ As the ventricles contract, atrial repolarization occurs simultaneously → Leads to atrial relaxation.

>> ○ Valve status: Atrioventricular (AV) valves are closed to prevent backflow from ventricles to atria; meniscus valves are also closed.

>> ○ First heart sound (S1) occurs: The AV valves close, producing the "lub" sound

> ⑥ QRS-T Interval: The phase when the ventricles are actively contracting

>> ○ Valve status: AV valves closed, meniscus valves open

>> ○ After ventricular contraction, the meniscus valves open and blood is ejected into the arteries

>> ○ Ventricular pressure rises and then begins to fall during this stage

> ⑦ T Wave: Ventricular repolarization, also includes a portion of the ST segment

>> ○ Ventricular repolarization → Leads to ventricular relaxation

>> ○ Valve status: To prevent blood from flowing back from arteries into ventricles, both AV and meniscus valves are closed

>> ○ Second heart sound (S2) occurs: Meniscus valves close, producing the "dub" sound

> ⑧ U Wave

>> ○ A small wave occurring after the T wave

>> ○ It is presumed to be a relaxation signal caused by the vesicles following depolarization.

> ⑨ R-R Interval: Also referred to as the interval or heart rate

> ⑩ Summary of Valve Status

>> ○ Lub Dub (≒ thump-thump): The sound of heart valves closing

>> ○ Lub (at Q point): AV valves closing; meniscus valves closed

>> ○ At S point: AV valves closed; meniscus valves opening

>> ○ Dub (just before T wave): AV valves closed; meniscus valves closing

>> ○ Just after T wave: AV valves opening; meniscus valves closed

> ⑪ [Electrical Axis of the Heart](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1459)

⑸ Frank-Starling Curve: Ventricular Pressure-Volume Curve

> ① Isovolumetric Contraction

> ② Ventricular Ejection

> ③ Isovolumetric Relaxation

> ④ Ventricular Filling

> ⑤ Cardiac Cycle: Isovolumetric contraction → Ejection (0.3 s) → Isovolumetric relaxation → 0.4 s → 0.1 s

>> ○ Reason for isovolumetric contraction: Due to the high pressure in the aorta

>> ○ Reason for isovolumetric relaxation: To receive blood from the atria

⑹ Fetal heart

> ① Blood with gas and mass exchange in the placenta enters the right atrium through the inferior vena cava (93% circulatory circulation, 7% pulmonary circulation)

> ② Foramen ovale: An opening between the left and right atria that remains open during the fetal stage.

>> ○ 60% of the blood going to the pulmonary artery goes to the aorta

>> ○ At birth, the left atrium contractions are greater than the right atrium contractions, which push the lid of the foramen ovale and block it.

>> ○ Incomplete closure of the foramen ovale (atrial septal defect): The foramen ovale fails to close properly, causing mixing of pulmonary and systemic circulation, leading to reduced exercise capacity (congenital).

> ③ Ductus arteriosus (Botallo’s duct): In the fetus, it allows blood from the pulmonary artery in fetus to flow into the aorta.

>> ○ Incomplete closure of the ductus arteriosus (patent ductus arteriosus) (congenital)

## **4\. Vascular system**

⑴ blood vessel

<b>Figure 10.</b> The structure of blood vessels

<br>

> ① Artery: Consists of three layers (intima, media, outer membrane), many elastic fibers and muscle fibers (smooth muscle), aorta (with 11% blood)

>> ○ The proportion of elastic tissue is relatively higher than that of veins → elasticity ↑

>> ○ With thick blood vessel walls, can withstand high blood pressure

>> ○ The elasticity of the artery wall allows the artery to return to its original state and maintain high blood pressure when the heart relaxes

>> ○ (Important) The aorta regulates its contraction and relaxation by itself

>> ○ (Important) Arterioles are controlled by contraction and relaxation by autonomic nerves

> ② Vein: Consists of three layers (intima, media, and outer membrane), the presence of valves and muscle fibers (smooth muscle), vena cava and predetermined vein (61% blood)

>> ○ More than the artery and larger in diameter, holding more than half the blood in the circulatory system

>> ○ The smallest blood flow resistance due to the largest radius among blood vessels

>> ○ Thinner, less elastic, and lower blood pressure than arteries to prevent backflow

>> ○ In addition to smooth muscle, there is a regulatory action of adjacent skeletal muscle

> ③ Capillaries

>> ○ Capillary wall consists of a very thin layer of epithelial cells. No smooth muscle

>> ○ Capillary pore (opening): Pores in a tube of endothelial cells. Not in the brain with strict control of BBB

>> ○ Basement: Peripheral, easy to permeate with endothelial cells → material exchange

>> ○ Hydrophobic, small hydrophilic: Simple diffusion of endothelial cell membrane. Carbon dioxide, water, glucose, amino acids, etc.

>> ○ Large Hydrophilic Material: Pass through transcytosis. Liver and small intestine have large endothelial cell spacing

>> ○ Cells 100 μm away from capillaries die

> ④ Blood pressure, total cross-sectional area, blood flow rate

>> ○ Increased ventricular contraction pressure when the aorta decreases in distensibility

>> ○ Increasing volume of single stroke increases ventricular contraction pressure

> ② Ventricular relaxation pressure (lowest): Peripheral circulation resistance, time to next systolic

>> ○ Decreased elongation of the aorta reduces ventricular diastolic pressure

>> ○ Single stroke does not affect ventricular relaxation

> ③ Pulse pressure (= systolic blood pressure-diastolic blood pressure) ← 1 stroke volume, elasticity of the aorta

> ④ Cardiac output: The volume of blood ejected from the ventricle for 1 minute, the volume change of the ventricles × heart rate for 1 minute

> ⑤ Blood pressure 120/80 (mmHg) is the pressure exerted in addition to the existing atmospheric pressure

> ⑥ Measurement of blood pressure

<b>Figure 15.</b> Blood pressure changes according to the cardiac cycle

<br>

> ⑧ Blood pressure = full load × post load

>> ○ Full load: Proportional to blood volume, long-term regulation, regulation in the kidneys

>> ○ After load: Proportional, short-term control of capillary perfusion resistance, control through arterial contraction and rela>> xation

>>> ○ Vascular resistance

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/b2yRtN/btrz1iLPoyL/XYkUvkkxSxldKJcxRlIVCk/img.png" alt="drawing" />

<br>

>>> ○ (Important) The body's distal blood pressure is greater than the pressure of the heart because it has to go against gravity, and skeletal muscle is involved.

>>> ○ (Note) Figure. 13.Is not identified because is a major vessel

⑶ Material transport through the walls of capillaries

> ① Capillaries have a single layer of cells and have the largest cross-sectional area, which is advantageous for mass exchange.

> ② Mass exchange method

>> ○ Simple diffusion or accelerated diffusion: Oxygen, carbon dioxide, small molecules, some ionic material

>> ○ Transcytosis: When moving large molecules (blood cells, proteins, etc.)

>> ○ Movement through capillary pores

>> ○ Active transport

>> ○ Osmotic pressure

> ③ Driving force for mass exchange

>> ○ Blood pressure

>> ○ Blood osmotic pressure: Formed by large molecules remaining in the capillaries

⑷ Mechanism of blood flow to the heart through veins

> ① Disruptors of Vein Blood Flow

>> ○ Veins have low blood pressure, which can reverse intravenous pressure depending on external conditions

>> ○ Example. Gravity: Obstruct the flow of blood from bottom to top through an artery or vein

> ② Vein Blood Flow Mechanism: Helps blood flow to the heart

>> ○ Valve: Prevent blood flow in the vein from reversed → Prevent blood flow reversed during muscle contraction and relaxation

>> ○ Periodic contraction of smooth muscles surrounding the veins

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/1x6hc/btrzYDQYJH8/zfbmpOs0FyME5Ls55nuG7k/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 16.</b> Vein Blood Flow Mechanism

<br>

>>> ○ When muscles contract, blood moves towards the heart

>>> ○ When the muscles relax, the valve closes to prevent blood backflow

>> ○ Skeletal muscle contracting during exercise

>>> ○ Example. Efficacy in removing blood clots formed in veins when traveling long distances

>> ○ Pressure changes in the chest cavity (negative pressure) dilate the vena cava around the heart

> ③ If an abnormality occurs in the valve of a vein, varicose veins develop: Blood stagnation, increased load, risk of pulmonary blood

⑸ Exchange of blood and tissue fluid

> ① Tissue fluid and lymphatic fluid

>> ○ Tissue

>>> ○ No plasma components, neutrophils, erythrocytes and platelets from capillaries

>>> ○ Tissue fluid is secreted from the capillaries to supply the cells with the nutrients and materials they need

>>> ○ Function: Cell and substance exchange, immune function

>>> ○ Return of tissue: About 85% of tissue fluid goes to capillaries, about 15% of tissue fluid goes to lymphatic vessels

>> ○ Lymphatic fluid

>>> ○ Tissue fluid entering the lymphatic vessel

>>> ○ No blood cells, protein, etc.

> ② Exchange of blood and tissue fluid through capillaries

>> ○ Hydrostatic pressure (or capillary pressure) (P<sub>c</sub>): Blood pressure acts as a force to push liquid

>> ○ Plasma osmotic pressure (π<sub>p</sub>): High osmotic pressure acts as a force to draw water from tissue fluid

>> ○ Tissue Fluid Osmotic Pressure (P<sub>IF</sub>)

>> ○ Tissue Fluid Osmotic Pressure (π<sub>IF</sub>)

>> ○ Net Filtration Pressure at End of Artery = (P<sub>c</sub>-P<sub>IF</sub>)-(π<sub>p</sub>-π<sub>IF</sub>) = (35-0)-(28-3) = 10 mmHg

>> ○ End venous net filtration pressure = (P<sub>c</sub>-P<sub>IF</sub>)-(π<sub>p</sub>-π<sub>IF</sub>) = (15-0)-(28-3) = -10 mmHg

> ③ Return of liquid components through the lymphatic system: Lymph circulation is 1/3000 of cardiac output

<br>

<b>Figure 17.</b> Blood and Lymphatic Exchange

<br>

>> ○ Formation of the lymphatic system: The amount of water that has drained into the tissue fluid is greater than the amount of water that has entered the blood

>> ○ Function

>>> ○ Lymph nodes: Along the main lymphatic vessels of birds and mammals, various immune cell locations, swelling upon infection

>>> ○ Absorption of fat-soluble nutrients: Lymphatic system has thin walls and high permeability, allowing fat-soluble nutrients to move

>>> ○ Tissue fluid → return to blood

>> ○ Lymphatic fluid recovery: Capillary Lymph Trachea → Chest Tube → Relative Vein → Subclavian Vein → Heart

>> ○ Backflow prevention mechanism

>>> ○ Lymphatic vessels have leaflets (limbs) that allow lymph to enter the chest tube without reflux

>>> ○ Shifted to the pressure the lymphatic vessel receives by surrounding skeletal muscle contraction

> ④ Dropsy: Increased tissue fluid beyond recovery imbalance or lymphatic system

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Blood flow control** 

Nerve signals, hormones, chemicals (ex. Histamine → smooth muscle relaxation) becomes a signal for blood flow regulation

⑴ Overall control: Blood flow control

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cUDTVi/btrzYZ0BjYE/uP5KUIPRZ4jdse179XfcQK/img.png" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 18.</b> Global blood flow regulation mechanism

The dashed line represents the feedback circuit associated with the specified blood pressure adjustment

<br>

> ① Soft water: Autonomic nervous system

>> ○ PH detection of cerebrospinal fluid → control breathing and circulation

>> ○ Since H<sup>+</sup> does not pass through BBB, pH change is detected through simple diffusion of CO2 and carbonate reaction.

> ② Arterial pressure vessels: Signals are sent to the aortic arch, carotid sinuses, and training

>> ○ The carotid arch is more efficient than the aortic arch

> ③ Blood Flow Control Process

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Increased blood pressure → arterial pressure receptors act on soft water

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Training promotes parasympathetic nerves by acting directly on parasympathetic nerves

>>> ○ Parasympathetic nerve endings: Acetylcholine Release, Beating Delay

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Soft water acts on the inhibitory neurons of the spinal cord to suppress sympathetic nerves

>>> ○ Sympathetic nerve endings: Epinephrine Release, Pulsation Promotion

>>> ○ Cardiac: Epinephrine

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Parasympathetic ↑, sympathetic ↓: Relaxation of the small arteries, delayed pulsation, decreased cardiac output

⑵ Local regulation: Contraction and Relaxation of Arterial Smooth Muscle

> ① Arterial smooth muscle is controlled by the autonomic nervous system

> ② General: When the sympathetic nervous system acts, the arteries toward the internal organs contract and the arteries toward the skeleton relax.

> ③ Transient hyperemia: The arterioles near tissues with low oxygen partial pressure and high carbon partial pressure relax and increase blood flow

> ④ Active hyperemia: Local activity (eg: Blood flow in proportion to changes in metabolism

> ⑤ Reactive hyperemia: Blood supply in response to blood flow decline

<br>

<b>Figure 19.</b> Aortic smooth muscle regulation mechanism

<br>

⑶ Local regulation: Capillary Microcirculation Control

> ① Contraction and Relaxation of Total Capillary Sphincter or Endothelial Cells

>> ○ Relaxation of the arterioles increases full load → increases capillary blood pressure

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=http%3A%2F%2Fcfile27.uf.tistory.com%2Fimage%2F99D0A83A5B3CD8FD0D6E93" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 20.</b> Mechanisms of Microcirculation Control of Capillaries

<br>

> ② Quantitative explanation: Blood flow resistance R is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of the tube r.. 2-⑻-⑧)

> ③ Small adjustments to the radius of one capillary can easily control the flow of blood to other capillaries

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Hemostasis and Blood Coagulation**: Blood loss prevention

⑴ Exogenous coagulation: Coagulation outside the vessel. General coagulation process

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Endothelial Surface Changes: Collagen exposure on endothelial cell surface

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Primary hemostasis

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. Platelets adsorb to collagen in connective tissue and physically block

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Secretion of substances that bind platelets to better bind nearby platelets

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Secondary hemostasis: Clumps blood cells in the blood while forming fibrin aggregates. Platelet plug formation

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=http%3A%2F%2Fcfile21.uf.tistory.com%2Fimage%2F275DB04756D1857B301356" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 21.</b> Blood clotting process

<br>

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. Fibrin Formation by Multistage Enzyme Reaction of Platelets, Damaged Cells, and Plasma Coagulation Factors

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. Secretion of clotting factors such as thrombokinase from damaged tissue cells

>>>○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Blood coagulation factor is activated by Ca2 +

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup>. Activated coagulation factor activates prothrombin to thrombin together with Ca2 +

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>-4<sup>th</sup>. Thrombin activates fibrinogen as fibrin

>>> ○ Plasma proteins, including thrombin in blood coagulation, protein lyase

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Fibrin conglomerates (blood clots) form as fibrin entangles and forms platelet stoppers to close wounds

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Vasoconstriction: Aggregated platelets contract smooth muscle, synthesizing thromboxane A2 and releasing chemical mediators

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. Arachidonic acid → prostaglandins: cyclooxygenase is involved

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Prostaglandins → Thromboxane: thromboxane synthetase is involved

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Wound closure

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. PDGF secretion from platelets

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. PDGF receptors on epithelial cells show tyrosine kinase activity

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup>. Increased collagen fibers in fibroblasts → wound closure

⑵ Endogenous coagulation: Coagulation in blood vessels

> ① Hagueman argument involved

> ② Generally speaking, blood coagulation refers to exogenous coagulation, not endogenous coagulation.

⑶ Regulation of blood clotting

> ① Vitamin K: Essential for blood clotting; other vitamins are virtually independent of blood clotting

> ② Prostacyclin (PGI2), Nitric Oxide (NO): Inhibit platelet aggregation

>> ○ From endothelial cells

>> ○ Prevent platelet plugs from forming at the site of injury

> ③ Aspirin

>> ○ Anticoagulant effect by inhibiting cyclooxygenase involved in thromboxane synthesis
 
>> ○ Heart attack prevention effect

>> ○ Used as a thrombolytic

> ④ Heparin, hirudin: Anticoagulant action by inhibiting the activation of protein lyase

>> ○ Heparin: Mast cells. Most of the carboxyl groups are negatively charged. Present in the liver

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> . Heparin and anti-thrombin III bind

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The three-dimensional structure of antithrombin changes

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Heparin and antithrombin conjugates irreversibly bind thrombin

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. When antithrombin binds to thrombin, heparin loses its binding capacity

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Heparin is recycled and combined with another antithrombin

>> ○ Hirudin: Secreted by leeches to prevent blood clotting

> ⑤ Warfarin: Competitive inhibitor of vitamin K, anticoagulant action by inhibiting prothrombin formation

> ⑥ EDTA, sodium citrate, sodium oxalate: Anticoagulant by removing calcium

> ⑦ Plasmin: Blood clot removal

⑷ Blood type and blood coagulation

> ① Type A standard serum (anti-B): Antigen A and Aggregate β

> ② Type B standard serum (anti-A): Antigen B and agglutinin α are present

> ③ Aggregate reaction between antigen A and agglutinin α, antigen B and agglutinin β

> ④ Blood type A: Aggregation reaction with type B standard serum (anti-A) with antigen A and very small aggregates β

> ⑤ Blood type B: Aggregation reaction with type A standard serum (anti-B) with antigen B and very small aggregates α

> ⑥ AB blood: Agglutination reaction with type A and B standard serum without antigen A and antigen B

> ⑦ O blood: No antigen and no aggregate reaction due to aggregate α and aggregate β

<br>

<br>

## **7\. Cardiovascular disease**

⑴ Arteriosclerosis: Oil in blood vessels causes arteries to harden

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/c0jcV2/btrzYUFDvPe/mOQJIkZRmOWVQCwruioPv0/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 22.</b> Arteriosclerosis

<br>

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Lipoproteins, such as LDL, become entangled in the arterial endothelium

>> ○ **case 1**: Cholesterol deposits on damaged sites after damage to the vessel's inner wall

>> ○ **case 2**: Cholesterol deposition around the inside of blood vessels: Decreased elasticity of blood vessels

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Macrophages eat them and transform them into fat-rich foam cells

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Plaque (a.K.a bamboo tomb formed: The secretion of extracellular substrates (such as collagen) results in larger lipoprotein masses.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Plaque also joins T lymphocytes and smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Part of the smooth muscle cells form a fibrous cap that separates the plaque from the blood

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. Foam cells in plaque die and release cellular residue and cholesterol

>> ○ When plaque explodes, blood clots develop in arteries

>>> ○ Example. If the coronary artery is blocked → causing angina

>> ○ If the plaque does not burst and continues to grow, the artery is blocked

> ⑦ 40 years to hematoma and clot formation

⑵ Heart attack and stroke

> ① heart attack: Caused by coronary artery blockage, oxygen supply to heart muscle is blocked and cardiomyocytes die

> ② Stroke: The death of tissue due to lack of oxygen due to the inability to flow blood to the cerebrovascular system

>> ○ Ischemic stroke: If the artery in the head is blocked → block the blood supply to the underlying tissues

>> ○ Hemorrhagic stroke: When the arteries of the head burst

>> ○ Treatment of stroke patients within 3 hours can completely reverse the consequences of a stroke

> ③ These two diseases are also caused by blood clots

⑶ High blood pressure

> ① Defition: Symptoms with a contraction pressure of at least 140 mmHg and a relaxation pressure of at least 90 mmHg

> ② Cause: Increased cardiac output, increased peripheral resistance

> ③ Characteristic: In hypertensive patients, carotid and aortic pressure receptors recognize hypertension as normal and do not perform subcutaneous reflexes.

⑷ Anemia: Red blood cells do not carry oxygen well

> ① Hemolytic anemia (eg: Sickle cell anemia): Insufficient red blood cell count

> ② Iron deficiency anemia

> ③ Anemia due to hematopoietic disorder

> ④ Pernicious anemia (eg: Lack of vitamin B12)

> ⑤ Myeloid dysfunction

⑸ Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases

> ① Cholesterol Level Survey: Investigating LDL / HDL

> ② Inflammatory Response: Inflammation plays a decisive role in atherosclerosis and thrombosis

>> ○ Cure: Aspirin → Heart Attack Prevents Stroke Again

>> ○ Investigate the amount of CRP (C reactive protein): Synthetic and inflammatory reactions in the liver increase blood levels

> ③ Blood pressure probe: In case of hypertension, damage to the inner wall → promote plaque formation
