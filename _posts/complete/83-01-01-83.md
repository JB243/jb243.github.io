## 1. Circulatory System

⑴ Types of Circulatory Systems

> ① Open Circulatory System

>> ○ **Organisms**: Arthropods and mollusks

>> ○ **Simplicity**: No capillaries; no clear distinction between hemolymph and interstitial fluid

>> ○ **Efficiency**: Low hydraulic pressure saves energy; no need to form capillary networks, making it easier to build and maintain the circulatory system

> ② **Closed Circulatory System**

>> ○ **Organisms**: Annelids, cephalopods, vertebrates, and other large or highly mobile organisms

>> ○ **Complexity**: Presence of capillaries creates a distinction between blood and interstitial fluid

>> ○ **Efficiency**: High hydraulic pressure allows efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients; osmotic pressure is maintained by large molecules in the blood, helping to regulate blood pressure

⑵ Circulatory System in Vertebrates (Cardiovascular System) – Closed Circulatory System

> ① Animals with high metabolic rates possess more complex blood vessels and a more powerful heart compared to those with lower metabolic rates

> ② The complexity and distribution of blood vessels in an organism are proportional to the metabolic activity of each organ

> ③ **Fish (1 atrium, 1 ventricle)** – *Single Circulation*

>> ○ No separation between systemic and pulmonary circulation; blood must pass through two capillary beds before returning to the heart, limiting blood flow speed.

>> ○ Maintains necessary blood flow via skeletal muscle activity.

>> ○ Only deoxygenated blood flows through the heart.

> ④ **Amphibians (2 atria, 1 ventricle)** – *Double Circulation*

>> ○ Systemic and pulmonary circulations are separated, allowing more blood supply to the brain and muscles; however, mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood reduces efficiency

>> ○ To compensate for lower oxygen efficiency, a cutaneous circulation system is developed

> ⑤ **Reptiles (2 atria, partially divided 2 ventricles)** – *Double Circulation*

>> ○ Less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood improves the efficiency of material exchange

> ⑥ **Birds and Mammals (2 atria, fully divided 2 ventricles)** – *Double Circulation*

>> ○ Complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood enables efficient material exchange

>> ○ This system supports endothermic animals, which consume approximately 10 times more energy than ectotherms of the same size

> ⑦ **Human Circulatory System**

>> ○ **Systemic circulation**: Left ventricle → Aorta → Whole body (capillaries) → Vena cava → Right atrium

>> ○ **Pulmonary circulation**: Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs (capillaries) → Pulmonary vein → Left atrium

## **2\. Blood composition and function**

⑴ Blood centrifugation: Separate blood by component

> ① Centrifugation with Anticoagulant: Separated red blood cells, soft layers, and plasma from below to top

>> ○ Soft layer (buffy coat): leucocytes + platelets

>> ○ Plasma: Liquid composition of blood

> ② Centrifugation without anticoagulant: Separated into blood clots and serum from below to top

>> ○ Blood clot: Ingredients of coagulated blood, red blood cells + leucocytes + platelets + blood coagulation factors

>> ○ Serum: Liquid components remaining after blood clotting, removal of fibrinogen and other components from plasma

>> ○ Cellular elements are entangled by fibrinogen in plasma

> ③ Erythrocyte volume fraction (hematocrit): Ratio of red blood cell volume to total blood volume

>> ○ Normal adult man: 0.41 to 0.51

>> ○ Normal adult woman: 0.36 to 0.45

>> ○ Why men use power more than women

>> ○ Anemic people have small hematocrit

>> ○ Viscosity is proportional to erythrocyte volume fraction

## **3\. Circulatory system and heart**

⑴ Structure of the heart

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/94yRP/btrzYDQYq43/VFUNm4zqY7YBHpaghg8uXK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 6.</b> Structure of the heart

<br>

> ① The heart is located beneath the sternum and is about the size of a fist, mostly composed of cardiac muscle.

> ② It consists of the atrium, which receives blood, and the ventricle, which delivers blood: two atria and two ventricles for human.

> ③ The ventricles have a thicker muscle layer than the atria and have a stronger contractile force.

>> ○ In particular, the left ventricle contracts with much stronger force, sending blood to each organ in the body

>> ○ The left ventricle contracts more powerfully than the right ventricle, but the same amount of blood is released in one contraction

> ④ Valve: Four valves in the heart prevent blood from flowing back

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/c9mjGf/btrzZ329Ysi/zKkl10nqsKBT9cWpTDPuSk/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 7.</b> Valve structure

<br>

>> ○ Atrioventricular valve: Between the atria and the ventricles, tricuspid and bicuspid

>> ○ Meniscus valve: Between the ventricle and the artery

>> ○ Abnormal sound (heart noise) occurs when blood is ejected through an incomplete valve when the valve is abnormal

⑵ Heart muscle

> ① Characteristic

>> ○ High density of capillaries and mitochondria: Aerobic respiration 

>> ○ Red due to high myoglobin content

>> ○ Nutrition: Fatty acids ≫ Glucose, lactic acid (∴ aerobic respiration only)

>> ○ Coronary artery: Blood supply to heart muscle, lack of blood supply to heart muscle causes cardiac arrest, heart attack, myocardial infarction

> ② Pacemaker Potential of Autorhythmic Cells

>> ○ Autorhythmic cells: Sinoatrial (SA) node (located in the right atrium), Atrioventricular (AV) node (located in the right atrium), Purkinje fibers

>>> ○ [SA node](https://jb243.github.io/pages/88#4-model-of-cardiac-muscle-contraction): Generates pacemaker potentials without external electrical signals

>>> ○ AV node and Purkinje fibers: Amplify potentials when they receive external electrical signals

>> ○ The SA node shortens the diastolic period and increases heart rate under sympathetic stimulation

>> ○ The SA node lengthens the diastolic period and decreases heart rate under parasympathetic stimulation

>> ○ The autonomic nerve that acts on the SA node is a branch of the vagus nerve (vagus n.)

> ③ [Plateau Potential of Ventricular Myocardium](https://jb243.github.io/pages/88#4-model-of-cardiac-muscle-contraction)

>> ○ Ventricular myocardium is influenced only by the sympathetic nervous system, which regulates stroke volume

> ④ [Contraction Mechanism of Ventricular Myocardium](https://jb243.github.io/pages/88#4-model-of-cardiac-muscle-contraction)

⑶ Cardiac cycle: How the heart pumps and receives blood

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/vkVM6/btrzYBZUg6Y/YYOzChk9DQvwfkOjeVxzKk/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 8.</b> Cardiac cycle

<br>

> ① Pulse: Changes in blood vessels according to the cardiac cycle

> ② Systolic: Blood flow in the ventricles → arteries

> ③ Diastolic: Blood flow atrium → ventricles

> ④ Atrium, Ventricular Relaxation: Intravenous → Atrium → Ventricular. Bicuspids and tricuspids open. Meniscal valve closed (0.4 seconds)

> ⑤ Atrial contraction, ventricular relaxation: Atrial blood → ventricles, Bicuspids and tricuspids open, meniscus closed (0.1 second)

> ⑥ The delayed time (0.1 seconds) that prevents the atria and ventricles from contracting simultaneously originates from the atrioventricular (AV) delay.

> ⑦ Delayed time so that the atria and the ventricles do not contract at the same time (0.1 second) is due to the atrioventricular delay

> ⑧ Cardiac arrest

>> ○ Cardiac arrest due to synchronization failure, fibrillation, arrhythmia

>> ○ Synchronization by electric shock (re-defibrillation)

⑷ Electrocardiography (ECG)

> ① Summary

>> ○ It represents the heartbeat as electrical signals and does not involve attaching electrodes directly to the heart; it is typically measured using 12 electrodes.

>> ○ Divided into waves and segments

>> ○ Wave: If it goes up above the baseline and then goes down

>> ○ Segment: Baseline between two waves

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bLCIfs/btrz3kv5JmK/BN8xcREE9huXj9g1PbkKG0/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 9.</b> Electrocardiogram

<br>

>> ○ [Understanding ECG signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIZQRjkwV9Q): Measures whether the electric field direction of the external electrodes aligns with the electric field direction within the heart.

> ② P wave: Depolarization of the SA node

>> ○ Sinoatrial node (SA node): Tissue that voluntarily generates action potentials

>> ○ A signal from the sinoatrial (SA) node causes atrial depolarization, leading to atrial contraction within 100 ms.

>> ○ Initial state of valve: Atrioventricular valve open, meniscus valve closed

>> ○ All cardiac muscle cells in the atria are connected by gap junctions, allowing the electrical signal from the sinoatrial (SA) node to rapidly spread throughout the entire atria.

> ③ P-Q interval: Atrioventricular (AV) Delay

>> ○ AV delay: A delay of approximately 0.1 seconds in the action potential at the AV node, allowing time for blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles

>> ○ Atrioventricular (AV) node

>>> ○ Gap junction pathway between the atria and ventricles

>>> ○ A pacemaker that receives signals from the SA node and generates fibrillation, synchronized with the SA node

> ④ Q point: The action potential reaches the bundle of His.

> ⑤ QRS Complex: Depolarization of the bundle of His and Purkinje fibers, i.e., ventricular depolarization

>> ○ The bundle of His and Purkinje fibers are also considered pacemakers.

>> ○ Depolarization of the Purkinje fibers → Ventricular depolarization → Triggers ventricular contraction.

>> ○ As the ventricles contract, atrial repolarization occurs simultaneously → Leads to atrial relaxation.

>> ○ Valve status: Atrioventricular (AV) valves are closed to prevent backflow from ventricles to atria; meniscus valves are also closed.

>> ○ First heart sound (S1) occurs: The AV valves close, producing the "lub" sound

> ⑥ QRS-T Interval: The phase when the ventricles are actively contracting

>> ○ Valve status: AV valves closed, meniscus valves open

>> ○ After ventricular contraction, the meniscus valves open and blood is ejected into the arteries

>> ○ Ventricular pressure rises and then begins to fall during this stage

> ⑦ T Wave: Ventricular repolarization, also includes a portion of the ST segment

>> ○ Ventricular repolarization → Leads to ventricular relaxation

>> ○ Valve status: To prevent blood from flowing back from arteries into ventricles, both AV and meniscus valves are closed

>> ○ Second heart sound (S2) occurs: Meniscus valves close, producing the "dub" sound

> ⑧ U Wave

>> ○ A small wave occurring after the T wave

>> ○ It is presumed to be a relaxation signal caused by the vesicles following depolarization.

> ⑨ R-R Interval: Also referred to as the interval or heart rate

> ⑩ Summary of Valve Status

>> ○ Lub Dub (≒ thump-thump): The sound of heart valves closing

>> ○ Lub (at Q point): AV valves closing; meniscus valves closed

>> ○ At S point: AV valves closed; meniscus valves opening

>> ○ Dub (just before T wave): AV valves closed; meniscus valves closing

>> ○ Just after T wave: AV valves opening; meniscus valves closed

> ⑪ [Electrical Axis of the Heart](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1459)

⑸ Frank-Starling Curve: Ventricular Pressure-Volume Curve

> ① Isovolumetric Contraction

> ② Ventricular Ejection

> ③ Isovolumetric Relaxation

> ④ Ventricular Filling

> ⑤ Cardiac Cycle: Isovolumetric contraction → Ejection (0.3 s) → Isovolumetric relaxation → 0.4 s → 0.1 s

>> ○ Reason for isovolumetric contraction: Due to the high pressure in the aorta

>> ○ Reason for isovolumetric relaxation: To receive blood from the atria

⑹ Fetal heart

> ① Blood with gas and mass exchange in the placenta enters the right atrium through the inferior vena cava (93% circulatory circulation, 7% pulmonary circulation)

> ② Foramen ovale: An opening between the left and right atria that remains open during the fetal stage.

>> ○ 60% of the blood going to the pulmonary artery goes to the aorta

>> ○ At birth, the left atrium contractions are greater than the right atrium contractions, which push the lid of the foramen ovale and block it.

>> ○ Incomplete closure of the foramen ovale (atrial septal defect): The foramen ovale fails to close properly, causing mixing of pulmonary and systemic circulation, leading to reduced exercise capacity (congenital).

> ③ Ductus arteriosus (Botallo’s duct): In the fetus, it allows blood from the pulmonary artery in fetus to flow into the aorta.

>> ○ Incomplete closure of the ductus arteriosus (patent ductus arteriosus) (congenital)

<br>

## **4\. Vascular system**

⑴ blood vessel

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/pjYzh/btrz3O4LZmT/0xfpIqzuog5pCKbYbR7USK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 10.</b> The structure of blood vessels

<br>

> ① Artery: Consists of three layers (intima, media, outer membrane), many elastic fibers and muscle fibers (smooth muscle), aorta (with 11% blood)

>> ○ The proportion of elastic tissue is relatively higher than that of veins → elasticity ↑

>> ○ With thick blood vessel walls, can withstand high blood pressure

>> ○ The elasticity of the artery wall allows the artery to return to its original state and maintain high blood pressure when the heart relaxes

>> ○ The aorta regulates its contraction and relaxation by itself

>> ○ The arterioles are regulated in terms of constriction and dilation by the autonomic nervous system.

> ② Vein: Consists of three layers (intima, media, and outer membrane). Valves and muscle fibers (smooth muscle) are present. The vena cava and the venules (61% blood)

>> ○ More than the artery and larger in diameter, holding more than half the blood in the circulatory system

>> ○ The smallest blood flow resistance due to the largest radius among blood vessels

>> ○ The walls are thinner and less elastic than those of arteries, and because the blood pressure is lower, valves are present to prevent backflow.

>> ○ In addition to smooth muscle, there is a regulatory action of adjacent skeletal muscle

> ③ Capillaries

>> ○ Capillary wall consists of a very thin layer of epithelial cells. No smooth muscle

>> ○ Capillary pore (opening): Pores in a tube of endothelial cells. Not in the brain with strict control of BBB

>> ○ Basal layer: Surrounded by endothelial cells, allowing for easy permeability, which facilitates the exchange of substances.

>> ○ Hydrophobic substances and small hydrophilic substances: pass through the endothelial cell membrane by simple diffusion. Examples include carbon dioxide, water, glucose, and amino acids.

>> ○ Large hydrophilic substances: Cross via transcytosis. In the liver and intestines, the gaps between endothelial cells are wide enough for proteins to pass through.

>> ○ Cells located more than 100 μm away from capillaries will undergo cell death.

>> ○ The diameter of alveolar capillaries is approximately 8 μm.

> ④ Blood pressure, total cross-sectional area, blood flow rate

<b>Figure 12.</b> Blood pressure

<br>

> ① Ventricular Contraction Pressure (Max): One heart rate, release rate

>> ○ Increased ventricular contraction pressure when the aorta decreases in distensibility

>> ○ Increasing volume of single stroke increases ventricular contraction pressure

> ② Ventricular relaxation pressure (lowest): Peripheral circulation resistance, time to next systolic period

>> ○ Decreased distensibility of the aorta reduces ventricular diastolic pressure

>> ○ The volume of single stroke does not affect ventricular relaxation.

> ③ Pulse pressure (= systolic blood pressure-diastolic blood pressure) ← 1 stroke volume, elasticity of the aorta

> ④ Cardiac output = The volume of blood ejected from the ventricle for 1 minute = The volume change of the ventricles × heart rate for 1 minute

> ⑤ Blood pressure 120/80 (mmHg) is the pressure exerted in addition to the existing atmospheric pressure

> ⑥ Measurement of blood pressure

<b>Figure 14.</b> How to measure blood pressure

<br>

> ⑦ Blood pressure changes according to the cardiac cycle (CV physiology)

<br>

<b>Figure 15.</b> Blood pressure changes according to the cardiac cycle

<br>

>> ○ The diastolic phase is approximately twice as long as the systolic phase.

>> ○ The MAP (mean arterial pressure) is commonly calculated using the formula: MAP = (2 × diastolic + systolic) / 3

> ⑧ Blood pressure = Full load × Posterior load

>> ○ Full load: Proportional to blood volume, long-term regulation, regulation in the kidneys

>> ○ Posterior load: Proportional to capillary perfusion resistance, etc. Short-term regulation, controlled through contraction and relaxation of arterioles.

>>> ○ Vascular resistance

<br>

<br>

>>> ○ The body's peripheral blood pressure is greater than the pressure of the heart because it has to go against gravity, and skeletal muscle is involved.

>>> ○ **Figure 15.** Is not identified because is a major vessel

⑶ Material transport through the walls of capillaries

> ① Capillaries have a single layer of cells and have the largest cross-sectional area, which is advantageous for mass exchange.

> ② Mass exchange method

>> ○ Simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion: Oxygen, carbon dioxide, small molecules, some ionic material

>> ○ Transcytosis: When moving large molecules (blood cells, proteins, etc.)

>> ○ Movement through capillary pores

>> ○ Active transport

>> ○ Osmotic pressure

> ③ Driving force for mass exchange

>> ○ Blood pressure

>> ○ Blood osmotic pressure: Formed by large molecules remaining in the capillaries

⑷ Mechanism of blood flow to the heart through veins

> ① Disruptors of Vein Blood Flow

>> ○ Veins have low blood pressure, which can reverse intravenous pressure depending on external conditions

>> ○ Example. Gravity: Obstruct the flow of blood from bottom to top through an artery or vein

> ② Vein Blood Flow Mechanism: Helps blood flow to the heart

>> ○ Valve: Prevent blood flow in the vein from reversed → Prevent blood flow reversed during muscle contraction and relaxation

>> ○ Periodic contraction of smooth muscles surrounding the veins

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/1x6hc/btrzYDQYJH8/zfbmpOs0FyME5Ls55nuG7k/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 16.</b> Vein Blood Flow Mechanism

<br>

>>> ○ When muscles contract, blood moves towards the heart

>>> ○ When the muscles relax, the valve closes to prevent blood backflow

>> ○ Skeletal muscle contracting during exercise

>>> ○ Example. Efficacy in removing blood clots formed in veins when traveling long distances

>> ○ Pressure changes in the chest cavity (negative pressure) dilate the vena cava around the heart

>> ○ ↑ Venous pooling → ↑ Capillary pressure → ↑ Filtration → ↑ Interstitial fluid (tissue cells)

> ③ If an abnormality occurs in the valve of a vein, varicose veins develop: Blood stagnation, increased load, risk of pulmonary blood

⑸ Exchange of blood and tissue fluid

> ① Tissue fluid and lymphatic fluid

>> ○ Tissue fluid

>>> ○ No plasma components, white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets from capillaries

>>> ○ Tissue fluid is secreted from the capillaries to supply the cells with the nutrients and materials they need

>>> ○ Function: Substance exchange with cells and immune function

>>> ○ Return of tissue: About 85% of tissue fluid goes to capillaries, and about 15% of tissue fluid goes to lymphatic vessels

>> ○ Lymphatic fluid

>>> ○ Tissue fluid entering the lymphatic vessel

>>> ○ No blood cells, protein, etc.

> ② Exchange of blood and tissue fluid through capillaries

>> ○ Hydrostatic pressure (capillary pressure) (P<sub>c</sub>): Blood pressure acts as a force to push liquid

>> ○ Plasma osmotic pressure (π<sub>p</sub>): High osmotic pressure acts as a force to draw water from tissue fluid

>> ○ Tissue Fluid Hydrostatic Pressure (P<sub>IF</sub>)

>> ○ Tissue Fluid Osmotic Pressure (π<sub>IF</sub>)

>> ○ Frank-Starling law: Interstitial fluid (tissue exudate) = K<sub>f</sub>(P<sub>c</sub> - P<sub>IF</sub>) - σ<sub>r</sub>(π<sub>p</sub> - π<sub>IF</sub>) ≒ (P<sub>c</sub> - P<sub>IF</sub>) - (π<sub>p</sub> - π<sub>IF</sub>)

>> ○ Net Filtration Pressure at End of Artery = (P<sub>c</sub>-P<sub>IF</sub>)-(π<sub>p</sub>-π<sub>IF</sub>) = (35-0)-(28-3) = 10 mmHg

>> ○ Net Filtration Pressure at End of Vein = (P<sub>c</sub>-P<sub>IF</sub>)-(π<sub>p</sub>-π<sub>IF</sub>) = (15-0)-(28-3) = -10 mmHg

> ③ Return of liquid components through the lymphatic system: Lymph circulation is 1/3000 of cardiac output

<b>Figure 17.</b> Blood and Lymphatic Exchange

<br>

>> ○ Formation of the lymphatic system: The amount of water that has drained into the tissue fluid is greater than the amount of water that has entered the blood

>> ○ Function

>>> ○ Lymph nodes: Exist along the main lymphatic vessels of birds and mammals. Various immune cells are located. Swelling upon infection.

>>> ○ Absorption of fat-soluble nutrients: Lymphatic system has thin walls and high permeability, allowing fat-soluble nutrients to move

>>> ○ Return to blood: Tissue fluid → blood

>> ○ Lymph fluid recovery: Lymphatic capillaries → Thoracic duct → Superior vena cava → Subclavian vein → Heart

>> ○ Backflow prevention mechanism

>>> ○ Lymphatic vessels have valves, like veins, that prevent backflow and ensure lymph flows into the thoracic duct.

>>> ○ Movement is driven by pressure from surrounding skeletal muscle contractions.

>> ○ A phenomenon that occurs in the lymphatic system

>>> ○ Lymphocytes in lymph nodes enter the bloodstream through the thoracic duct.

>>> ○ Lymphocytes exit capillary walls, pass through interstitial spaces, and enter the lymphatic system.

>>> ○ Lymphatic vessels serve as pathways for nutrient transport from the small intestine to the bloodstream.

>>> ○ Blood cells cannot enter the lymphatic system.

> ④ Edema: An increase in interstitial fluid due to an imbalance in fluid recovery or abnormalities in the lymphatic system.

## **5\. Blood flow control** 

⑴ Overview

> ① Neural signals, hormones, and chemicals serve as signals for blood flow regulation.

> ② The brain requires a constant and stable blood flow at all times.

⑵ **Overall control:** Blood flow control

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cUDTVi/btrzYZ0BjYE/uP5KUIPRZ4jdse179XfcQK/img.png" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 18.</b> Global blood flow regulation mechanism

The dashed line represents the feedback circuit associated with the specified blood pressure adjustment

<br>

> ① Medulla oblongata: the autonomic nervous system control center

>> ○ PH detection of cerebrospinal fluid → control of breathing and circulation

>> ○ Since H<sup>+</sup> does not pass through BBB, pH change is detected through simple diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> and carbonate acid-base reaction.

> ② Arterial Baroreceptors

>> ○ Located in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses, they send signals to the medulla oblongata.

>> ○ The carotid sinus is a more effective baroreceptor than the aortic arch.

> ③ Blood Flow Control Process

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Increased blood pressure → Arterial baroreceptors act on the medulla oblongata.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The medulla oblongata directly stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.

>>> ○ Parasympathetic nerve terminals: release acetylcholine, resulting in delayed heart rate.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The medulla oblongata acts on inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord to suppress the sympathetic nervous system.

>>> ○ Sympathetic nerve terminals: release epinephrine, which increases heart rate.

>>> ○ Cardiotonic agent: epinephrine

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. ↑ Parasympathetic activity, ↓ Sympathetic activity: arteriolar dilation, delayed pacemaker activity, decreased cardiac output.

> ④ **Example 1.** Astronauts

>> ○ Although the actual water volume is low, the body is misled into thinking there is excess fluid → increased urine output.

>> ○ Recovery mechanism: ↑ Sympathetic activity → prevents peripheral blood pooling → conserves body fluids.

> ⑤ **Example 2.** Orthostatic Hypotension

>> ○ Due to gravity, venous return ↓ → cerebral blood flow ↓ → symptoms of dizziness/faintness.

>> ○ Recovery mechanism: ↑ Sympathetic activity → prevents peripheral blood pooling → conserves body fluids.

⑶ **Local regulation:** Contraction and Relaxation of Arterial Smooth Muscle

> ① Arterial smooth muscle is controlled by the autonomic nervous system

> ② General: When the sympathetic nervous system is activated, arterioles leading to visceral organs constrict, while arterioles leading to skeletal muscles dilate.

> ③ Transient hyperemia: Arterioles near tissues with low oxygen partial pressure and high carbon dioxide partial pressure dilate, increasing blood flow.

> ④ Active hyperemia: Blood flow supply is proportional to metabolic changes caused by local activity (e.g., exercise).

> ⑤ Reactive hyperemia: Increased blood flow in response to a prior reduction in blood flow.

>> ○ Endothelin: A vasoconstrictor

<b>Figure 19.</b> Aortic smooth muscle regulation mechanism

<br>

⑷ **Local regulation:** Capillary Microcirculation Control

> ① Contraction and Relaxation of Total Capillary Sphincter or Endothelial Cells

>> ○ Relaxation of the arterioles increases full load → increases capillary blood pressure

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=http%3A%2F%2Fcfile27.uf.tistory.com%2Fimage%2F99D0A83A5B3CD8FD0D6E93" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 20.</b> Mechanisms of Microcirculation Control of Capillaries

<br>

> ② Quantitative explanation: Blood flow resistance (R) is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel radius (r).

> ③ Even a slight adjustment of the radius of a specific capillary can easily regulate the blood flow through that vessel as well as other associated capillaries.

⑸ **Local regulation:** Histamine

> ① Capillary dilation during inflammatory response

> ② Increased vascular permeability

> ③ Increased blood flow to the injured area (↑ complement protein influx)

> ④ Relaxation of smooth muscle

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Blood Coagulation**

⑴ Exogenous coagulation: Coagulation outside the vessel. General coagulation process

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Endothelial Surface Changes: Exposure of collagen on the endothelial cell surface

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Primary hemostasis

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. Platelets adsorb to collagen in connective tissue and physically block

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Secretion of substances by bound platelets that promote the adhesion of nearby platelets

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Secondary hemostasis: Clumps blood cells in the blood while forming fibrin aggregates. Platelet plug formation

<br>

>>>○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Blood coagulation factor is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup>. Activated coagulation factor activates prothrombin to thrombin together with Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>-4<sup>th</sup>. Thrombin activates fibrinogen (in the sol state) into fibrin (in the gel state).

>>> ○ In blood coagulation, thrombin and other plasma proteins are proteolytic enzymes.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. As fibrin clumps together, a fibrin clot (thrombus) forms, creating a platelet plug that seals the wound site.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Vasoconstriction: Aggregated platelets contract smooth muscle, synthesizing thromboxane A2 and releasing chemical mediators

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. Arachidonic acid → prostaglandins: cyclooxygenase is involved

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Prostaglandins → Thromboxane: thromboxane synthetase is involved

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Wound closure

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. PDGF secretion from platelets

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. PDGF receptors on epithelial cells show tyrosine kinase activity

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup>. Increased collagen fibers in fibroblasts → wound closure

⑵ Endogenous coagulation: Coagulation within blood vessels

> ① Involves Hageman factor.

> ② Generally speaking, blood coagulation refers to exogenous coagulation, not endogenous coagulation.

⑶ Regulation of blood clotting

> ① Vitamin K: Essential for blood clotting; other vitamins are independent of blood clotting

> ② Prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>), Nitric Oxide (NO): Inhibit platelet aggregation

>> ○ Generated from endothelial cells

>> ○ Prevention of platelet plug formation in areas other than the site of injury

> ③ Aspirin

>> ○ Exerts an anticoagulant effect by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, which is involved in thromboxane synthesis

>> ○ Positive effects: antipyretic and analgesic action, prevention of heart attacks, thrombolytic effect

>> ○ Side effects: gastric ulcers (related to mucous membrane formation), cases of death due to inability to stop bleeding during surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral hemorrhage

> ④ Heparin, hirudin: Anticoagulant action by inhibiting the activation of protein lyase

>> ○ Heparin: synthesized by mast cells, with most of its carboxyl groups carrying a negative charge; present in the liver.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> . Heparin and anti-thrombin III bind

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The three-dimensional structure of antithrombin changes

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Heparin and antithrombin conjugates irreversibly bind to thrombin

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. When antithrombin binds to thrombin, its binding affinity for heparin decreases, causing it to dissociate.

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Heparin is recycled and combined with another antithrombin

>>> ○ Types: Unfractionated heparin, Enoxaparin, Daltaparin, Tinzaparin

>> ○ Hirudin: an anticoagulant substance found in leeches, secreted to prevent the ingested blood from clotting.

⑷ Blood type and blood coagulation

> ① ABO Blood Type

>> ○ Type A standard serum (anti-B): contains antigen A and agglutinin β.

>>> ○ Type A blood recognizes substances similar to antigen B—produced by Escherichia coli—as foreign, and produces agglutinin β.

>> ○ Type B standard serum (anti-A): contains antigen B and agglutinin α.

>>> ○ Type B blood recognizes substances similar to antigen A—produced by Escherichia coli—as foreign, and produces agglutinin α.

>> ○ Reaction with standard sera:

>>> ○ Agglutination occurs between antigen A and agglutinin α, and between antigen B and agglutinin β.

>>> ○ Type A blood: has antigen A and a trace amount of agglutinin β, and agglutinates with type B standard serum (anti-A).

>>> ○ Type B blood: has antigen B and a trace amount of agglutinin α, and agglutinates with type A standard serum (anti-B).

>>> ○ Type AB blood: has both antigen A and antigen B but no agglutinins; agglutinates with both type A and type B standard sera.

>>> ○ Type A can donate only to types A and AB.

>>> ○ Type B can donate only to types B and AB.

>>> ○ Type AB can donate only to type AB.

>>> ○ Type O can donate to types AB, A, B, and O.

>> ○ **Example 1**: Transfusing type O blood into type A

>>> ○ Antibodies in type O blood are in trace amounts, so they do not cause a major problem.

>>> ○ From the type A recipient’s perspective, there are no foreign antigens, so it is not problematic.

>> ○ **Example 2**: Transfusing type A blood into type O

>>> ○ Antibodies in type A blood are in trace amounts, so they do not cause a major problem.

>>> ○ From the type O recipient’s perspective, the foreign antigen A is introduced, leading to the production of large amounts of α antibodies, causing an agglutination reaction → death.

## **7\. Cardiovascular disease**

⑴ Arteriosclerosis: Oil in blood vessels causes arteries to harden

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/c0jcV2/btrzYUFDvPe/mOQJIkZRmOWVQCwruioPv0/img.jpg" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 22.</b> Arteriosclerosis

<br>

> ① Definition: a condition in which fat builds up inside blood vessels, causing arteries to harden.

>> ○ CAD (coronary artery disease): a disease of the coronary arteries.

>> ○ Heart attack: caused by blockage of the coronary arteries, which stops the supply of oxygen to the heart muscle and leads to the death of heart muscle cells.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Lipoproteins, such as LDL, become entangled in the arterial endothelium

>> ○ **case 1**: Cholesterol deposits on damaged sites after damage to the vessel's inner wall

>> ○ **case 2**: Cholesterol deposition around the inside of blood vessels: Decreased elasticity of blood vessels

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Macrophages ingest it and transform into lipid-rich foam cells.

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Plaque (atheromatous deposit) formation: when extracellular matrix components (such as collagen) are secreted, the lipoprotein mass enlarges.

> ⑤ 4<sup>th</sup>. T lymphocytes and smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall also join the plaque.

> ⑥ 5<sup>th</sup>. Part of the smooth muscle cells form a fibrous cap that separates the plaque from the blood

> ⑦ 6<sup>th</sup>. Foam cells in plaque die and release cellular residue and cholesterol

>> ○ If a plaque ruptures, a thrombus forms in the artery.

>> ○ If a plaque does not rupture but continues to grow, it can block the artery.

>> ○ When the coronary artery is blocked, it causes angina pectoris.

> ⑧ 7<sup>th</sup>. It takes about 40 years for hematoma and thrombus formation to occur. ChatGPT에게 묻기

> ⑨ **Type 1.** Atherosclerosis: CD40-CD40L is involved.

> ⑩ **Type 2.** Gaucher’s disease

> ⑪ **Type 3.** Niemenn-Pick disease

⑵ Primary hyperlipidemia: One of genetic diseases 

> ① Type Ⅰ: Lipoprotein lipase deficiency

> ② Type Ⅱa: Defective LDL receptor

> ③ Type Ⅱb: Unknown cause

> ④ Type Ⅲ: Abnormal apoplipoprotein E

> ⑤ Type Ⅳ: Unknown cause

> ⑥ Type Ⅴ :Deficiency of apoplipoprotein C

⑶ Stroke

> ① Definition: A condition in which blood cannot flow through the cerebral blood vessels, causing tissue death due to lack of oxygen.

>> ○ Ischemic stroke: Occurs when an artery in the head becomes blocked → blood supply to downstream tissue is cut off.

>> ○ Hemorrhagic stroke: Occurs when an artery in the head ruptures.

>> ○ If treated within three hours, the effects of a stroke can be completely reversed.

> ② Can also be caused by a blood clot (thrombus).

⑷ Hypertension

> ① Defition: Symptoms with a contraction pressure of at least 140 mmHg and a relaxation pressure of at least 90 mmHg

> ② Cause: Increased cardiac output, increased peripheral resistance

> ③ Characteristic: In patients with hypertension, the pressure receptors (baroreceptors) in the carotid artery and aorta perceive the high blood pressure as normal, resulting in a failure to initiate the baroreceptor reflex to lower blood pressure.

⑸ Anemia

> ① Overview

>> ○ Definition: A condition in which red blood cells are unable to effectively carry oxygen.

>> ○ More specifically, it refers to cases where the hemoglobin level or hematocrit level in the blood — in other words, the concentration of red blood cells — is lower than normal.

> ② Anemia due to impaired hematopoiesis: Includes hemolytic anemia (e.g., sickle cell anemia) and other conditions with a reduced number of red blood cells. Red blood cell production can also decrease after blood transfusions.

> ③ Iron-deficiency anemia

> ④ Pernicious anemia (e.g., caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12)

> ⑤ Aplastic anemia: Anemia resulting from damage to bone marrow production function. It cannot be treated with medication and requires blood transfusions.

> ⑥ Renal anemia: Anemia caused by kidney failure; it cannot be treated with medication and requires blood transfusions.

⑹ Cardiomyopathy

> ① **Type 1.** DCM (Dilated Cardiomyopathy): Left ventricular dilation with normal left ventricular wall thickness.

> ② **Type 2.** HCM (Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy): Increased left ventricular wall thickness; associated with mutations in sarcomere genes.

⑺ Lymphatic System–Related Diseases

> ② FL (Follicular Lymphoma):

>> ○ Grade I: Between 0 and 5 centroblasts

>> ○ Grade II: Between 6 and 15 centroblasts

>> ○ Grade III: More than 15 centroblasts

>> ○ Grade III-A: Centrocytes are present

>> ○ Grade III-B: Centroblasts form clusters

> ③ MCL (Mantle Cell Lymphoma)

⑻ Brugada Syndrome: A rare disorder in which the heart suddenly stops beating (sudden cardiac arrest).

<br>

<br>

## 8. Cardiovascular Diagnosis

⑴ Diagnosis of CAD (Coronary Artery Disease)

> ① Invasive methods

>> ○ Invasive coronary angiography: Traditional gold standard; offers high resolution.

>> ○ FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve): Distal coronary pressure ÷ proximal coronary pressure.

>> ○ IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound): The catheter tip emits ultrasound waves.

>> ○ OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography): Detects lesions at a higher resolution than IVUS; more advanced than NIRS.

> ② Direct visualization methods among non-invasive techniques

>> ○ CAC (Coronary Calcium Score)

>> ○ EBCT (Electron Beam CT)

>> ○ MDCT (Multidetector CT)

>> ○ Magnetic Resonance Angiography

> ③ Functional imaging techniques among non-invasive methods

>> ○ Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy: Uses SPECT and PET.

>> ○ SE (Stress Echocardiography)

>> ○ CMR (Cardiac MRI)

>> ○ CT Angiography: Performed after intravenous injection, followed by image reconstruction.

⑵ Cholesterol level assessment: Measure LDL/HDL levels.

⑶ Inflammatory response assessment: Inflammation plays a critical role in atherosclerosis and thrombus formation.

> ① Treatment: Aspirin → prevents recurrence of heart attack and stroke.

> ② CRP (C-reactive protein) measurement: Synthesized in the liver; blood levels increase during inflammatory responses.

⑷ Blood pressure assessment: In hypertension, arterial wall damage promotes plaque formation.

⑸ Myocardial perfusion agents

| **half time**   | 74 hr | 6 hr       | 2 min   | 20 min  | 1.2 min |

**Table 2.** Myocardial perfusion agents

<br>

⑹ Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR)

> ① A compensatory mechanism in which blood vessels dilate in response to changes in pressure to maintain a constant blood flow.

> ② Because there is a limit to how much the vessels can dilate, there is a certain pressure at which blood flow can no longer remain constant and instead decreases.

> ③ In people with angina, coronary flow reserve is reduced.
