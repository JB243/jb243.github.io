## **1\. Overview of Breathing**

⑴ Stage of breathing

> ① Exhalation **:** Gas exchange between the atmosphere and the respiratory tract (ventilation)

> ② Diffusion **:** Gas exchange between respiratory tract and blood

> ③ Mass transport **:** Carrying of blood

> ④ Breathing **:** Gas exchange between blood and tissue cells

> ⑤ (Note) cell respiration **:** Receives O2 to oxidize organic matter and produces CO2 and ATP

⑵ Insect breathing **:** Direct air to the engine only

> ① Air flow **:** Institutions → Institutions → Air capillaries

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Atmospheric O2 flows into the trachea (the thickest air duct) through the gate on the side of the abdomen

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Air entering the trachea is the trachea (a.K.a bronchiole)

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Air pockets exist due to the presence of expanded sites near tissues with high oxygen demand

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. O2 in the bronchus moves through the diffusion into the air capillary

> ② The shape of the organ is retained by the ring-shaped chitin

> ③ The end of the bronchus is filled with a dark blue liquid. → As the momentum increases, oxygen consumption increases, and most of this liquid is absorbed into the body fluid, which increases the volume of the bronchial tube containing air.

> ④ Diving Insect **:** Using Bubbles to Absorb Oxygen

⑶ Fish breathing **:** Using gills as a respiratory tract

> ① Located on both sides of the fish

> ② Four gill bows located between the mouth and the gill lids

> ③ Hundreds of gill filaments, lamellar up and down

>> ○ Lamella **:** Practical gas exchange surface

> ④ Blood vessels passing through the gill **:** Afferent vessels, centrifugal vessels

>> ○ Afferent blood vessels **:** Carries blood to the gills

>> ○ Efferent vessels **:** Withdrawing blood from gills

> ⑤ Increased gas exchange efficiency by ventilation and backflow exchange

>> ○ Backflow Exchange **:** Blood flow inside the lamellae and water flow in opposite directions

⑷ Amphibian breathing

> ① Using gills during larval period, then lungs when adult

>> ○ Reptiles, birds and mammals breathe using their lungs

> ② Ventilate with positive pressure breathing

>> ○ Breathe positively **:** Breathing, swallowing air, increasing the pressure near the breathing surface to allow oxygen in the air to dissolve in capillaries across the breathing surface

>> ○ Breathing negative pressure. mammalia) **:** A breath that lowers the pressure near the breathing surface so that oxygen in the air dissolves in capillaries that cross the breathing surface.

> ③ Skin respiration **:** 50% of gas exchanges through the skin

⑸ Bird breathing

> ① Envelope **:** Lungs and space inside some bones

> ② flow of air **:** Trachea → Bronchus → Lateral Bronchus → Air Capillary, two inhales and exhalations

>> ○ Back air bag → Lung → Front air bag

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. First breath **:** Air fills the rear pockets

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. First exhalation **:** The back airbag contracts and sends air to the lungs

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Second inhale **:** Air flows out of the lungs into the front airbag

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Second exhalation **:** The anterior lung contracts and releases the air that entered the body by the first inhale

> ③ Advantages of bird breathing

>> ○ Algae lungs are not blocked at the end → residual amount × → gas exchange efficiency ↑

>> ○ Less contraction and relaxation than mammals

⑹ Mammal Breathing (See. 2, 3)

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Lung Structure (Mammals)**

⑴ Air flow **:** Mouth or nose → nasal cavity → pharynx → larynx → airway → bronchus → tracheobronchial (bronchial) → alveoli

> ① Air is filtered, warmed and humidified through the nasal passages

> ② Air from the nasal passages moves to the pharynx (inlet of the esophagus and larynx), where it meets food from the mouth.

> ③ Palate reflection

>> ○ When swallowing food

>>> ○ Epiglottis **:** Structures that send food to the esophagus and air to the airways

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The larynx moves up to close the epiglottis at the gate that corresponds to the entrance to the prayer

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Food goes down the esophagus and reaches over

>> ○ Rest time **:** Prayer can open and breathe

>> ○ Sends foreign substances trapped in the mucus of goblet cell to esophagus

> ④ vocal cords

>> ○ The larynx and the lining of the airways (the role of the vocal cords) are fortified with cartilage to ensure airways at all times

> ○ High tone when strong contraction of vocal cord muscles, low tone when weak contraction

> ⑤ Bronchus **:** 2, the inner wall epithelial cells of the main bronchus pass the foreign body to the esophagus using cilia and mucus

⑵ Anatomy of the lungs

> ① The lungs are made of light spongy tissue, mostly filled with air-filled spaces

> ② Each lung is surrounded by a pleural sac that prevents gas exchange with the chest cavity

⑶ Alveoli

> ① 400 million, monolayer epithelium, diameter 0.1 to 0.3 mm

> ② Alveoli-capillary spacing **:** 0.1 to 1.5 μm for very smooth diffusion

> ③ Special structure of alveoli causes lung elasticity

>> ○ The alveoli are muscleless (disrupting gas exchange) but the connective tissue contains large amounts of elastin, which allows it to contract and relax

>> ○ Elastin fibers **:** Has elastic force opposite to tension

>> ○ Moisture tension **:** Microscopic layers of moisture on alveoli attract each other to create strong contractile pressure

> ④ Types of Alveolar Cells

>> ○ First alveolar cell **:** Mostly epithelial cells

>> ○ Second alveolar cell **:** Secretion of surfactant on the surface of villi → Alveolar distortion due to surface tension of water

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/Tt1uu/btrz0Dwnnec/r2ddnmmMiyx1S5On7ZKCWK/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

>> ○ Smaller alveolar second alveolar cells secrete more surfactant to lower higher surface tension

>> ○ Neonatal Respiratory Disorder Syndrome (NRDS) **:** Lack of surfactant secretion due to premature death of infants, second stage alveolar cells

>> ○ Macrophage **:** Foreign object removal

> ⑤ Number of alveoli 8 × 10<sup>6</sup> → Respiratory epithelium area 50 ~ 100 m<sup>2</sup> (See. Body surface area ~ 2 m<sup>2</sup>)

⑷ Functional structure of the lungs

> ① Lung blood **:** 0.5 L (10-12% of total blood)

> ② Volume of the lungs **:** 3 L

> ③ Mammals and fish have a larger respiratory surface area at higher weights

> ④ Oxygen respiration in mammals is proportional to alveolar surface area

> ⑤ Obesity **:** Lack of respiratory area → limited oxygen supply → decreased activity

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Lung ventilation (mammals)**

⑴ Breathing pressure **:** Consumes 3-5% of total energy

> ① The lungs are passively ventilated with diaphragm and intercostal contractions connected to the pleura

>> ○ The lungs themselves have no muscles and cannot actively contract

>> ○ Thoracic cavity **:** The lungs are floating in the chest cavity and the chest cavity is a closed space

>> ○ Pleura **:** Comprised of proximal and pleural pleura, pleural effusion in interstitial space (3-4 mL)

>>> ○ Pneumothorax **:** Perforation of the pleura due to infection or cuts

>> ○ Gang **:** Thin space surrounding the lungs

>> ○ Contractions of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles are transmitted to the lungs through the pleural effusion so that the lungs are passive contractions

>> ○ Lung flexibility **:** More surfactant, less scar tissue increases lung flexibility

> ② Inspiration (Inhalation) **:** Rib rise (external intercostal contraction), diaphragm descend (diaphragm contraction) → thoracic expansion → pressure drop → air inflow

> ③ Exhalation **:** Rib lowering (intercostal contraction), diaphragm rise (diaphragm relaxation) → thoracic contraction → pressure rise → air release

>> ○ Less consumption of ATP during the exhalation process due to gravity and lung elasticity

> ④ Alveolar pressure, intrathoracic pressure change during breathing

>> ○ **Point 1.** The pleural intraluminal pressure should be less than the alveolar pressure because the human body regulates the pleural cavity pressure to control the alveolar pressure

>> ○ **Point 2.** The lungs show a wave graph because the air flows in when the pressure is lowered to offset the change.

>> ○ Volumetric-pressure curve of the lung (link **:** / 1464) **:** When inflating requires more pressure than when contracting

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ckHAFt/btrz1kwBABn/KvhODTssKh4yn5R57fHMaK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 1.</b> Volumetric-pressure curve of the lung</center>

> ⑤ Disadvantages **:** Partial Pressure Slope Reduction, Backflow Gas Exchange ×

>> ○ Due to the large amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, the disadvantages do not significantly affect species survival

⑵ Spirometry curve

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/WP2rE/btrz2rhWpEO/Xj4caRbUQIkm5pfAmRDaTk/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 2.</b> Ventilation</center>

> ① Parameter

>> ○ Inspiratory residual volume

>> ○ Expiratory residual volume

>> ○ Residual volume

>> ○ Spirometry = 1 tidal volume + absorbent reserve + phagocytic reserve

>> ○ Total lung volume = 1 breath volume + absorbent reserve amount + eosinophilic reserve amount + residue amount

>> ○ Intake volume = tidal volume + absorbent reserve

>> ○ Functional residue amount = phagocytic reserve amount + residue amount

> ② Gas exchange at rest

>> ○ Tidal volume **:** 500 mL

>> ○ Ventilation rate **:** Respiratory Rate Per Minute. Typically 8-12 times per minute

>> ○ Total waste ventilation **:** Ventilation rate × tidal volume = 8 × 500 mL / min to 12 × 500 mL / min = 3 to 6 L / min

>> ○ Inspiration **:** Nitrogen 78%, Oxygen 21%, Carbon Dioxide 0.3%

>> ○ Exhalation **:** Nitrogen 78%, Oxygen 17%, Carbon Dioxide 4%

>> ○ 250 mL O<sup>2</sup> / min influx into the blood → 360 to 600 L / day O<sup>2</sup>

>> ○ 200 mL CO<sup>2</sup> / min discharge into the lungs

>> ○ Alveolar ventilation increased more than 20 times during exercise, alveoli blood flow increased 5-6 times

> ③ Dead space

>> ○ Amount that does not contribute to gas exchange at one breath

>> ○ Cause **:** Trachea from trachea to bronchioles lack respiratory epithelium and fail to participate in gas exchange

>> ○ Degree **:** The anatomical dead space is about 140 mL, but the physiological dead space is about 150 mL, given that the bronchial dilated upon inspiration.

>> ○ Alveolar ventilation volume (the amount of air reaching the alveoli) = ventilation rate (breath rate per minute) × (1 breath volume-dead space)

> ④ Ventilation volume and partial pressure of gas in the alveoli

>> ○ Acidosis, Alkalosis General (See. 6)

>> ○ Ventilation volume ↑ → CO2 release ↑ → respiratory alkalosis

>> ○ Ventilation volume ↓ → CO2 in plasma ↑ → respiratory acidosis

⑶ Transpulmonary Pressure-Volume Graph

> ① Compliance 

>> ○ The degree to which the volume changes with pressure change

>> ○ More surfactant increases the extension

> ② Inspiration **:** Confrontation between force to inflate alveoli and surface tension

>> ○ Graphs that don't seem to increase in volume

>> ○ When treating surfactant **:** Reduced surface tension → Easy alveolar expansion → Moving graph in the direction of increasing volume

> ③ Exhalation **:** Strength of alveoli and surface tension strengthen each other

>> ○ A graph that seems to increase in volume

>> ○ When treating surfactant **:** Decrease in surface tension → negative alveolar contraction → move graph in the direction of increasing volume

<br>

## **4\. Gas transport of blood**

⑴ Breathing pigment **:** Special proteins that carry oxygen

> ① Hemocyanin **:** Breathing pigments of arthropods and molluscs, blue (including Cu)

> ② Hemoglobin **:** Breathing pigments of most vertebrates and invertebrates, red (including Fe)

> ③ Myoglobin **:** More oxygen affinity than hemoglobin, red (including Fe)

>> ○ Diving mammals, heart and muscles are high in myoglobin

>> ○ Myoglobin cannot enter the blood

⑵ Oxygen transport

> ① Function of hemoglobin **:** Oxygen transport

>> ○ One red blood cell contains 250 million Hb → carries 1 billion molecules of oxygen (99%)

>>> ○ 198 mL / L of 200 mL / L of total blood oxygen

>> ○ Less than 1% oxygen dissolved in plasma or red blood cell substrate

>> ○ Respiratory pigment has higher saturation with higher oxygen partial pressure

>> ○ Hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the lungs (100% saturation) and dissociates only about 30 to 40% at the tissue ends

> ② Structure **:** Allosteric enzyme, α2 β2 (quaternary structure, HbA), each unit consisting of heme and globin

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/sSx74/btrz356x7j0/yt8bEMKFX3kq0XngJzKCU1/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 3.</b> Structure of hemoglobin</center>

>> ○ Myoglobin only consists of tertiary structure

>> ○ Heme **:** It has an organic ring structure called porphyrin, with Fe2+ in the center

>> ○ Fetus **:** HbF (Hb Fetus) is present

>>> ○ Embryo ~ 8 weeks **:** ζ2 ε2 

>>> ○ About 6 weeks pregnant, HbF begins to be produced in the liver

>>> ○ Around 8 months of pregnancy, HbA begins to form in the bone marrow

>>> ○ In newborns, 70% are HbF and 30% are HbA

>>> ○ Rapid HbA (Hb Adult) replacement between 3 and 6 months after birth (HbF destruction)

>>> ○ Oxygen affinity **:** α2 γ2 \> α2 β2

>>>> ○ Oxygen released from maternal hemoglobin binds to fetal hemoglobin

>>>> ○ Cause **:** BPG binding site sequence difference, γ chain of HbF and β chain of HbA differ about 38% in amino acid sequence

>>>> ○ BPG affinity **:** γ chain β chain (See. 4-⑶-④)

>> ○ HbA<sub>2</sub> **:** About 2% of hemoglobin in adults (98% is HbA), α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ See **:** Hemocyanin is a respiratory pigment with copper, not iron, found in arthropods and molluscs a lot.

> ③ Ligands that bind to Hb's heme (competitive inhibition of oxygen)

>> ○ oxy Hb **:** Hb + O<sub>2</sub> **→** HbO<sub>2</sub>(red)

>> ○ saturated oxy HB **:** Hb + 4O<sub>2</sub> → Hb(O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>

>> ○ reduced Hb **:** Hb + H<sup>+</sup> **→** HHb (reddish brown)

>> ○ met Hb **:** OH<sup>-</sup> (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) occurs occasionally, but resolves itself in vivo

>> ○ carboxy Hb **:** CO (affinity ) causes carbon monoxide poisoning

>> ○ cyano Hb **:** Causes of death of CN<sup>-</sup> (affinity ) and cyanide (KCN)

>> ○ (Note) Carbon dioxide and 2,3-BPG bind to globin and do not act as an inhibitor, but lower red blood cell oxygen transport ability.

> ④ Cooperative **:** In the fourth structure, when the substrate is bound to one monomer, the affinity of the substrate of the surrounding monomer increases.

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bfb1qo/btrzYF9N6gT/3t7QrQxw6puIm3J21syeJK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 4.</b> Myoglobin</center>

>> ○ Myoglobin forms the shape (MM type) expected by the Michaelis-Menten equation because of the constant affinity of the substrate.

>>> ○ Myoglobin is not an allosteric protein such as hemoglobin

>>> ○ Myoglobin has higher oxygen affinity than hemoglobin, so oxygen storage at low oxygen partial pressure; The presence of multiple myocytes

>>> ○ Seals, which are submersible mammals, store about twice as much oxygen per kilogram of body weight as myoglobin ↑.

>> ○ Hemoglobin shows the sigmoid type (S-shape) because the affinity of the substrate is gradually increased

>>> ○ Hemoglobin is an allosteric protein to which two or more ligands can bind

>>> ○ Even if only one oxygen molecule is bound to hemoglobin, the subunit becomes a structure with high affinity with oxygen

>>> ○ Conversely, only one oxygen molecule escapes from saturated hemoglobin, resulting in a low oxygen affinity.

>>> ○ Stability **:** Oxygen carrying capacity is greatly reduced even when the partial pressure of oxygen in alveoli and arterial blood reaches 100 mmHg to 60 mmHg ×

⑶ Bore effect **:** Oxygen Affinity Change of Hemoglobin by Four Factors (pH, pCO2, Temperature, 2,3-BPG)

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xcttj/btrz2rvt83K/rky4XN8nTzu1658nCVSZn1/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 5.</b> Bore effect</center>

> ① H<sup>+</sup> effect

>> ○ [H<sup>+</sup>] ↑ → pH ↓ → Changes in ionic bonds in Hb (eg histidine of β chain) → Hb conformation change → oxygen affinity ↓

>> ○ Oxygen and dissociated hemoglobin combine with hydrogen ions to prevent acidification of blood

>> ○ Ion Bond Change 1 **:** \-COOH **↔** \-COO\- + H<sup>+</sup> (Place **:** Globin)

>> ○ Ion Bond Change 2 **:** \-NH2 + H+ **↔** \-NH3+ (Location **:** Globin)

>> ○ Oxygen affinity change during exercise 1 **:** PH ↓ → oxygen affinity ↓ due to lactic acid and fatty acid production

> ② CO<sub>2</sub> effect

>> ○ CO<sub>2</sub> ↑ → CO<sub>2</sub> binding or acid increase at N-terminus → Hb conformational change → oxygen affinity ↓

>> ○ CO<sub>2 bonding at the N-terminus 

>> ○ Acid increase **:** If pCO<sub>2</sub> is high, pH is reduced to H + derived from carbonic acid.

>> ○ Reduced oxygen affinity allows hemoglobin to dissociate oxygen better in tissue cells

> ③ Temperature effect

>> ○ Temperature ↑ → Hb conformation change → Oxygen affinity ↓

>> ○ Actively metabolizing or exercising cells release heat

>> ○ Enzymes rapidly lose their activity as their intramolecular bonds weaken at temperatures after their activation temperature

> ④ 2,3-BPG (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate) effect

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/19sY2/btrzYFB07wM/e9fDaTzcUGO5liH5kSQ73k/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 6.</b> Action of 2,3-BPG</center>

>> ○ 2,3-BPG **:** Active production of glycolysis, isomer of 1,3-BPG, an intermediate product of glycolysis

>> ○ Mammalian erythrocytes have high concentrations of 2,3-BPG

>> ○ 2,3-BPG ↑ → Stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin by combining with β globin in the middle of hemoglobin → additional oxygen affinity ↓

>> ○ Oxygen affinity change during exercise 2 **:** Tissue cell oxygen debt phenomenon → Some G3Ps convert to 2,3-BPG → Oxygen bond in β globin ↓

> ⑤ When moving to a high altitude mountain

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Reduction of partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Decreases the amount of oxygen binding of hemoglobin in the lungs

>>> ○ Increase respiratory rate to compensate for insufficient oxygen binding

>>> ○ Respiratory algorithm **:** Increasing respiratory rate releases excess CO2, increasing blood pH

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Decreased oxygen supply to tissue cells → Increased 2,3-BPG in red blood cells

>>> ○ Reduced oxygen affinity of hemoglobin releases more oxygen from oxygen hemoglobin

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Reduced oxygen supply to the kidneys

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. Increased erythropoietin secretion in the kidneys

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Promote red blood cell production in bone marrow → increase red blood cell count

⑷ Carbon dioxide transport

> ① Plasma **:** 8%, simple diffusion (melting)

>> ○ CO<sub>2</sub> (g) → CO<sub>2</sub> (aq)

> ② Combined with hemoglobin **:** HbCO<sub>2</sub>, about 22%

> ③ Bicarbonate ion **:** HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, about 70%

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) simply diffuses from plasma to red blood cells

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Promoted by CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) → H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (_aq_), carbonic anhydrase (CA)

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> → H+ + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. H<sup>+</sup> combines with Hb to become HHb (See. ⑶-①)

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is one-to-one reverse cotransport with Cl<sup>-</sup> and discharged out of plasma

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Osmotic pressure causes water to enter as Cl<sup>-</sup> increases in erythrocytes → volume increases

⑸ Pulmonary and body circulation **:** Circulation and respiratory system harmony

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/conBSL/btrz2rCgsmz/3F2a2gkWQPmyFSlLqu55z0/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Control of breathing**

⑴ Control of number **:** Cortex → Cortex spinal cord → Motor neurons

⑵ Self-regulating central **:** Pontoon, training → voluntary, rhythmic activity

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/3TRUw/btrz34Gy0Qm/hMnr3fukD3J8AHdLtQGTAK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 9.</b> Control of breathing</center>

<br>

<br>

> ① Soft water **:** Basic breathing control

>> ○ Soft water is more affected by carbon dioxide than oxygen

> ② Pons **:** Adjusts for smooth transition between inspiration and exhalation, breathing rate

> ③ Input and receiver

>> ○ Chemical receptors in the central nervous system (especially cerebrospinal fluid) (pO<sub>2</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup>)

>>> ○ H<sup>+</sup> cannot cross the brain-vascular barrier so chemical receptors determine H<sup>+</sup> by the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>

>>> ○ Increase metabolism through exercise → CO<sub>2</sub> ↑ → Increase respiration → Excessive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions → Normalize pH

>> ○ Input of chemical receptors (H<sup>+</sup>, pO<sub>2</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub>) of aortic bodies (next to the aortic arch) and carotid bodies (next to the carotid artery)

>>> ○ O<sub>2</sub> concentration does not have a significant effect on breathing, but increases respiration rate when O<sub>2</sub> levels are low

>> ○ Plasma epinephrine and potassium concentration receptors

>> ○ Muscle and joint kidney receptor input

>> ○ Renal Receptor Input to Lung

>> ○ Stimulation (temperature, etc.) input through other receptors and under Thalamus

> ④ Breathing control process

>> ○ Breathing exercise **:** Sympathetic stimulation, adrenaline secretion

>> ○ Respiratory movement suppression **:** Parasympathetic stimulation, acetylcholine secretion

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Acidosis and Alkalosis**

⑵ Acidosis and Alkalosis

> ① Acidosis **:** pH 7.35 or less

> ② Alkalosis **:** pH 7.45 or more

⑶ Metabolic alkalosis **:** Metabolism Excessive HCO3\-

> ① Excess HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reacts with H<sup>+</sup> resulting in high pH

> ② Compensation **:** Increased partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> by lowering breathing rate to lower pH

> ③ Example **:** Vomiting (exhaust acid from the stomach)

⑷ Metabolic acidosis **:** If HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is low due to metabolism

> ① Less HCO<sub>3</sub>sup>-</sup>, H<sup>+</sup> remains in the blood, resulting in lower pH

> ② Compensation **:** Lowers CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure by increasing respiration rate to increase pH

> ③ Example **:** Diarrhea (Bicarbonate Release)

⑸ Respiratory alkalosis **:** When the partial pressure of CO2 is lowered in relation to breathing

> ① Lower CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure results in higher blood pH

> ② Compensation **:** Suppresses HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>reaction to lower pH

> ③ Example **:** Hyperventilation, limited lung disease (e.g., Pulmonary fibrosis)

⑹ Respiratory acidosis **:** High CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure associated with respiration

> ① Low CO<sub>2</sub> pH due to no CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

> ② Compensation **:** Activate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup-</sup> reaction to increase pH

> ③ Example **:** Obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma)

<br>

<br>

## **7\. Lung disease**

⑴ Tobacco hazards **:** 100,000 chemicals, 20 species Class A carcinogens, tar, carbon monoxide, nicotine are the most hazardous substances

> ① Tar (tobacco, less than 10 mg) **:** Including 40 kinds of carcinogens, perturbing blood, destroying cells, causing chronic inflammation, disturbed immune system, cilia (ex. Elastin) damage

> ② carbon monoxide **:** Incomplete combustion products, most substances in cigarette smoke, the main causes of chronic hypoxia, premature aging, arteriosclerosis

> ③ Nicotine (one open 0.1 to 0.6 mg) **:** 7 seconds reach brain, addictive, narcotic, insecticide, herbicide, blood pressure rise

> ④ Benzopyrene, dimethylnitrosamine **:** Carcinogen

> ⑤ Cyanide **:** Death Gas Poison

> ⑥ Niphthylamine **:** Antiseptic

> ⑦ Naphthalene **:** Mothballs

> ⑧ DDT **:** Pesticide

⑵ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

> ① Symptom **:** Ventilation disorders caused by narrowing the airways and increasing resistance to air flow

> ② Characteristic **:** Total lung capacity and residues are higher than normal (compensation), respiratory function usually lower than normal

> ③ **Example 1.** Chronic bronchitis **:** Bronchial mucus hypersecretion → chronic inflammation of the lower airways

> ④ **Example 2.** Bronchial asthma **:** Allergic reactions, viral infections, alveolar contractions, increased mucus secretion, increased airway resistance in the airways, chronic inflammation, particulates exacerbate asthma

> ⑤ **Example 3.** Emphysema **:** Causes of wound tissue formation due to bronchitis and asthma, small airway destruction and obstruction reduce alveoli and surface area, inability to regenerate

⑶ Restrictive Lung Disease

> ① Symptom **:** Ventilation disorders caused by decreased lung extension (compliance, compliance)

> ② Characteristic **:** Total lung capacity and residues are less than normal, performing a respiratory function equivalent to normal in a limited range

> ③ **Example 1.** Pulmonary fibrosis

> ③ **Example 2.** Pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis

> ④ **Example 3.** Occupational lung disease

>> ○ Asbestos, coal dust, silicon, paper dust, pollen, etc., accumulate in macrophages that remove it

>> ○ Increased scar tissue → Fibrous tissue sutures wounds instead of lung tissue → Fibrocystic cysts and lung flexibility decreases

⑷ Lung cancer

> ① It contains a burning carcinogen of tobacco smoke

> ② Particulates, such as tar, remain on the lung surface for a long time causing mutations and cancer

⑸ Pulmonary edema (pulmonary edema)

> ① Moisture in the pulmonary vein due to excess lymph retrieval capacity (pulmonary capillary tissue fluid) leaves the alveoli and pools into water → difficulty breathing

> ② Cause **:** Heart failure increases blood pressure in pulmonary veins, lowers external pressure
