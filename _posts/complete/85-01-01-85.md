## **1\. Overview of Breathing**

⑴ Stage of breathing

> ① Exhalation: Gas exchange between the atmosphere and the respiratory tract (ventilation)

> ② Diffusion: Gas exchange between respiratory tract and blood

> ③ Mass transport: Carrying of blood

> ④ Breathing: Gas exchange between blood and tissue cells

> ⑤ Cell respiration: Receives O<sub>2</sub> to oxidize organic matter and produces CO<sub>2</sub> and ATP

⑵ Respiration in Insect: Delivers air directly through a system of tracheae only.

> ① Airflow Pathway: Trachea → Tracheoles → Air Capillaries

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Atmospheric oxygen enters the trachea (the largest air tube) through spiracles located on the sides of the abdomen.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The inhaled air moves into the tracheoles, which are narrow tubes closed at one end, branching from the trachea.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Near tissues with high oxygen demand, there are expanded sections of tracheoles that act as air sacs.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Oxygen in the tracheoles diffuses into the air capillaries.

> ② The structure of the trachea is supported by ring-shaped chitin.

> ③ The ends of the tracheoles are filled with a dark bluish liquid. When activity increases and oxygen consumption rises, most of this liquid is absorbed into the body fluid, increasing the air-filled volume of the tracheoles.

> ④ Aquatic insects use air bubbles for oxygen intake while submerged.

⑶ Respiration in Fish: Use of Gills as Respiratory Organs

> ① Located on both sides of the fish.

> ② Each side contains four gill arches situated between the mouth and the operculum, which serve as structural supports.

> ③ Each gill arch bears hundreds of gill filaments, and lamellae are arranged above and below these filaments.

>> ○ Lamellae: The actual surface for gas exchange.

> ④ Blood vessels passing through the gills: afferent vessels and efferent vessels.

>> ○ Afferent vessels: Carry blood to the gills.

>> ○ Efferent vessels: Carry blood away from the gills.

> ⑤ Gas exchange efficiency is enhanced through ventilation and countercurrent exchange.

>> ○ Countercurrent exchange: The flow of blood inside the lamellae is in the opposite direction to the flow of water over them.

⑷ Respiration in Amphibians

> ① During the larval stage, amphibians use gills; as adults, they use lungs for respiration.

>> ○ Reptiles, birds, and mammals all rely on lungs for breathing.

> ② Amphibians ventilate their lungs using positive-pressure breathing.

>> ○ Positive-pressure breathing: A breathing mechanism in which air is pushed into the lungs by increasing pressure near the respiratory surface, allowing oxygen to dissolve into the capillaries passing through it.

>>> ○ This involves a "gulping" or swallowing motion to force air into the lungs.

>> ○ Negative-pressure breathing: A mechanism that lowers the pressure near the respiratory surface, drawing air in so that oxygen can diffuse into the surrounding capillaries.

>>> ○ Example: Mammals.

> ③ Cutaneous respiration: About 50% of gas exchange occurs through the skin.

⑸ Respiration in Birds

> ① Air sacs: Air-filled spaces located in the lungs and some bones.

> ② Airflow pathway: Trachea → Bronchi → Secondary bronchi → Air capillaries → Involves two inhalations and two exhalations for a single breath cycle.

>> ○ Posterior air sacs → Lungs → Anterior air sacs

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> Inhalation: Air enters and fills the posterior air sacs.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> Exhalation: Posterior air sacs contract, pushing air into the lungs.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> Inhalation: Air moves from the lungs into the anterior air sacs.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> Exhalation: Anterior air sacs contract, expelling the air taken in during the first inhalation.

> ③ Advantages of avian respiration:

>> ○ The bird lung is not dead-ended, meaning no residual volume remains after exhalation, leading to high gas exchange efficiency.

>> ○ Birds have less expansion and contraction of the lungs compared to mammals.

⑹ Respiration in Mammals

## **2\. Lung structure (mammals)**

⑴ Air flow: Mouth or nose → nasal cavity → pharynx → larynx → airway → bronchus → tracheobronchial (bronchial) → alveoli

> ① Air is filtered, warmed and humidified through the nasal passages

> ② Air from the nasal passages moves to the pharynx (inlet of the esophagus and larynx), where it meets food from the mouth.

> ③ Palate reflection

>> ○ When swallowing food

>>> ○ Epiglottis: Structures that send food to the esophagus and air to the airways

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The larynx moves up to close the epiglottis at the gate that corresponds to the entrance to the prayer

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Food goes down the esophagus and reaches over

>> ○ Rest time: Prayer can open and breathe

>> ○ Sends foreign substances trapped in the mucus of goblet cell to esophagus

> ④ vocal cords

>> ○ The larynx and the lining of the airways (the role of the vocal cords) are fortified with cartilage to ensure airways at all times

> ○ High tone when strong contraction of vocal cord muscles, low tone when weak contraction

> ⑤ Bronchus: 2, the inner wall epithelial cells of the main bronchus pass the foreign body to the esophagus using cilia and mucus

⑵ Anatomy of the lungs

> ① The lungs are made of light spongy tissue, mostly filled with air-filled spaces

> ② Each lung is surrounded by a pleural sac that prevents gas exchange with the chest cavity

⑶ Alveoli

> ① 400 million, monolayer epithelium, diameter 0.1 to 0.3 mm

> ② Alveoli-capillary spacing: 0.1 to 1.5 μm for very smooth diffusion

> ③ Special structure of alveoli causes lung elasticity

>> ○ The alveoli are muscleless (disrupting gas exchange) but the connective tissue contains large amounts of elastin, which allows it to contract and relax

>> ○ Elastin fibers: Has elastic force opposite to tension

>> ○ Moisture tension: Microscopic layers of moisture on alveoli attract each other to create strong contractile pressure

> ④ Types of Alveolar Cells

>> ○ First alveolar cell: Mostly epithelial cells

>> ○ Second alveolar cell: Secretion of surfactant on the surface of villi → Alveolar distortion due to surface tension of water

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/Tt1uu/btrz0Dwnnec/r2ddnmmMiyx1S5On7ZKCWK/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

>> ○ Smaller alveolar second alveolar cells secrete more surfactant to lower higher surface tension

>> ○ Neonatal Respiratory Disorder Syndrome (NRDS): Lack of surfactant secretion due to premature death of infants, second stage alveolar cells

>> ○ Macrophage: Foreign object removal

> ⑤ Number of alveoli 8 × 10<sup>6</sup> → Respiratory epithelium area 50 ~ 100 m<sup>2</sup> (See. Body surface area ~ 2 m<sup>2</sup>)

⑷ Functional structure of the lungs

> ① Lung blood: 0.5 L (10-12% of total blood)

> ② Volume of the lungs: 3 L

> ③ Mammals and fish have a larger respiratory surface area at higher weights

> ④ Oxygen respiration in mammals is proportional to alveolar surface area

> ⑤ Obesity: Lack of respiratory area → limited oxygen supply → decreased activity

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Lung ventilation (mammals)**

⑴ Breathing pressure: Consumes 3-5% of total energy

> ① The lungs are passively ventilated with diaphragm and intercostal contractions connected to the pleura

>> ○ The lungs themselves have no muscles and cannot actively contract

>> ○ Thoracic cavity: The lungs are floating in the chest cavity and the chest cavity is a closed space

>> ○ Pleura: Comprised of proximal and pleural pleura, pleural effusion in interstitial space (3-4 mL)

>>> ○ Pneumothorax: Perforation of the pleura due to infection or cuts

>> ○ Gang: Thin space surrounding the lungs

>> ○ Contractions of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles are transmitted to the lungs through the pleural effusion so that the lungs are passive contractions

>> ○ Lung flexibility: More surfactant, less scar tissue increases lung flexibility

> ② Inspiration (Inhalation): Rib rise (external intercostal contraction), diaphragm descend (diaphragm contraction) → thoracic expansion → pressure drop → air inflow

> ③ Exhalation: Rib lowering (intercostal contraction), diaphragm rise (diaphragm relaxation) → thoracic contraction → pressure rise → air release

>> ○ Less consumption of ATP during the exhalation process due to gravity and lung elasticity

> ④ Alveolar pressure, intrathoracic pressure change during breathing

>> ○ **Point 1.** The pleural intraluminal pressure should be less than the alveolar pressure because the human body regulates the pleural cavity pressure to control the alveolar pressure

>> ○ **Point 2.** The lungs show a wave graph because the air flows in when the pressure is lowered to offset the change.

>> ○ Volumetric-pressure curve of the lung (link: / 1464): When inflating requires more pressure than when contracting

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ckHAFt/btrz1kwBABn/KvhODTssKh4yn5R57fHMaK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 1.</b> Volumetric-pressure curve of the lung</center>

> ⑤ Disadvantages: Partial Pressure Slope Reduction, Backflow Gas Exchange ×

>> ○ Due to the large amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, the disadvantages do not significantly affect species survival

⑵ Spirometry curve

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/WP2rE/btrz2rhWpEO/Xj4caRbUQIkm5pfAmRDaTk/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 2.</b> Ventilation</center>

> ① Parameter

>> ○ Inspiratory residual volume

>> ○ Expiratory residual volume

>> ○ Residual volume

>> ○ Spirometry = 1 tidal volume + absorbent reserve + phagocytic reserve

>> ○ Total lung volume = 1 breath volume + absorbent reserve amount + eosinophilic reserve amount + residue amount

>> ○ Intake volume = tidal volume + absorbent reserve

>> ○ Functional residue amount = phagocytic reserve amount + residue amount

> ② Gas exchange at rest

>> ○ Tidal volume: 500 mL

>> ○ Ventilation rate: Respiratory Rate Per Minute. Typically 8-12 times per minute

>> ○ Total waste ventilation: Ventilation rate × tidal volume = 8 × 500 mL / min to 12 × 500 mL / min = 3 to 6 L / min

>> ○ Inspiration: Nitrogen 78%, Oxygen 21%, Carbon Dioxide 0.3%

>> ○ Exhalation: Nitrogen 78%, Oxygen 17%, Carbon Dioxide 4%

>> ○ 250 mL O<sup>2</sup> / min influx into the blood → 360 to 600 L / day O<sup>2</sup>

>> ○ 200 mL CO<sup>2</sup> / min discharge into the lungs

>> ○ Alveolar ventilation increased more than 20 times during exercise, alveoli blood flow increased 5-6 times

> ③ Dead space

>> ○ Amount that does not contribute to gas exchange at one breath

>> ○ Cause: Trachea from trachea to bronchioles lack respiratory epithelium and fail to participate in gas exchange

>> ○ Degree: The anatomical dead space is about 140 mL, but the physiological dead space is about 150 mL, given that the bronchial dilated upon inspiration.

>> ○ Alveolar ventilation volume (the amount of air reaching the alveoli) = ventilation rate (breath rate per minute) × (1 breath volume-dead space)

> ④ Ventilation volume and partial pressure of gas in the alveoli

>> ○ Acidosis, Alkalosis General (See. 6)

>> ○ Ventilation volume ↑ → CO2 release ↑ → respiratory alkalosis

>> ○ Ventilation volume ↓ → CO2 in plasma ↑ → respiratory acidosis

⑶ Transpulmonary Pressure-Volume Graph

> ① Compliance 

>> ○ The degree to which the volume changes with pressure change

>> ○ More surfactant increases the extension

> ② Inspiration: Confrontation between force to inflate alveoli and surface tension

>> ○ Graphs that don't seem to increase in volume

>> ○ When treating surfactant: Reduced surface tension → Easy alveolar expansion → Moving graph in the direction of increasing volume

> ③ Exhalation: Strength of alveoli and surface tension strengthen each other

>> ○ A graph that seems to increase in volume

>> ○ When treating surfactant: Decrease in surface tension → negative alveolar contraction → move graph in the direction of increasing volume

## **4\. Gas transport of blood**

⑴ Breathing pigment: Special proteins that carry oxygen

> ① Hemocyanin: Breathing pigments of arthropods and molluscs, blue (including Cu)

> ② Hemoglobin: Breathing pigments of most vertebrates and invertebrates, red (including Fe)

> ③ Myoglobin: More oxygen affinity than hemoglobin, red (including Fe)

>> ○ Diving mammals, heart and muscles are high in myoglobin

>> ○ Myoglobin cannot enter the blood

⑵ Oxygen transport

> ① Function of hemoglobin: Oxygen transport

>> ○ One red blood cell contains 250 million Hb → carries 1 billion molecules of oxygen (99%)

>>> ○ 198 mL / L of 200 mL / L of total blood oxygen

>> ○ Less than 1% oxygen dissolved in plasma or red blood cell substrate

>> ○ Respiratory pigment has higher saturation with higher oxygen partial pressure

>> ○ Hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the lungs (100% saturation) and dissociates only about 30 to 40% at the tissue ends

> ② Structure: Allosteric enzyme, α2 β2 (quaternary structure, HbA), each unit consisting of heme and globin

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/sSx74/btrz356x7j0/yt8bEMKFX3kq0XngJzKCU1/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 3.</b> Structure of hemoglobin</center>

>> ○ Myoglobin only consists of tertiary structure

>> ○ Heme: It has an organic ring structure called porphyrin, with Fe2+ in the center

>> ○ Fetus: HbF (Hb Fetus) is present

>>> ○ Embryo ~ 8 weeks: ζ2 ε2 

>>> ○ About 6 weeks pregnant, HbF begins to be produced in the liver

>>> ○ Around 8 months of pregnancy, HbA begins to form in the bone marrow

>>> ○ In newborns, 70% are HbF and 30% are HbA

>>> ○ Rapid HbA (Hb Adult) replacement between 3 and 6 months after birth (HbF destruction)

>>> ○ Oxygen affinity: α2 γ2 \> α2 β2

>>>> ○ Oxygen released from maternal hemoglobin binds to fetal hemoglobin

>>>> ○ Cause: BPG binding site sequence difference, γ chain of HbF and β chain of HbA differ about 38% in amino acid sequence

>>>> ○ BPG affinity: γ chain β chain (See. 4-⑶-④)

>> ○ HbA<sub>2</sub>: About 2% of hemoglobin in adults (98% is HbA), α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ See: Hemocyanin is a respiratory pigment with copper, not iron, found in arthropods and molluscs a lot.

> ③ Ligands that bind to Hb's heme (competitive inhibition of oxygen)

>> ○ oxy Hb: Hb + O<sub>2</sub> **→** HbO<sub>2</sub>(red)

>> ○ saturated oxy HB: Hb + 4O<sub>2</sub> → Hb(O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>

>> ○ reduced Hb: Hb + H<sup>+</sup> **→** HHb (reddish brown)

>> ○ met Hb: OH<sup>-</sup> (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) occurs occasionally, but resolves itself in vivo

>> ○ carboxy Hb: CO (affinity ) causes carbon monoxide poisoning

>> ○ cyano Hb: Causes of death of CN<sup>-</sup> (affinity ) and cyanide (KCN)

>> ○ (Note) Carbon dioxide and 2,3-BPG bind to globin and do not act as an inhibitor, but lower red blood cell oxygen transport ability.

> ④ Cooperative: In the fourth structure, when the substrate is bound to one monomer, the affinity of the substrate of the surrounding monomer increases.

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bfb1qo/btrzYF9N6gT/3t7QrQxw6puIm3J21syeJK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 4.</b> Myoglobin</center>

>> ○ Myoglobin forms the shape (MM type) expected by the Michaelis-Menten equation because of the constant affinity of the substrate.

>>> ○ Myoglobin is not an allosteric protein such as hemoglobin

>>> ○ Myoglobin has higher oxygen affinity than hemoglobin, so oxygen storage at low oxygen partial pressure; The presence of multiple myocytes

>>> ○ Seals, which are submersible mammals, store about twice as much oxygen per kilogram of body weight as myoglobin ↑.

>> ○ Hemoglobin shows the sigmoid type (S-shape) because the affinity of the substrate is gradually increased

>>> ○ Hemoglobin is an allosteric protein to which two or more ligands can bind

>>> ○ Even if only one oxygen molecule is bound to hemoglobin, the subunit becomes a structure with high affinity with oxygen

>>> ○ Conversely, only one oxygen molecule escapes from saturated hemoglobin, resulting in a low oxygen affinity.

>>> ○ Stability: Oxygen carrying capacity is greatly reduced even when the partial pressure of oxygen in alveoli and arterial blood reaches 100 mmHg to 60 mmHg ×

⑶ Bore effect: Oxygen Affinity Change of Hemoglobin by Four Factors (pH, pCO2, Temperature, 2,3-BPG)

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xcttj/btrz2rvt83K/rky4XN8nTzu1658nCVSZn1/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 5.</b> Bore effect</center>

> ① H<sup>+</sup> effect

>> ○ [H<sup>+</sup>] ↑ → pH ↓ → Changes in ionic bonds in Hb (eg histidine of β chain) → Hb conformation change → oxygen affinity ↓

>> ○ Oxygen and dissociated hemoglobin combine with hydrogen ions to prevent acidification of blood

>> ○ Ion Bond Change 1: \-COOH **↔** \-COO\- + H<sup>+</sup> (Place: Globin)

>> ○ Ion Bond Change 2: \-NH2 + H+ **↔** \-NH3+ (Location: Globin)

>> ○ Oxygen affinity change during exercise 1: PH ↓ → oxygen affinity ↓ due to lactic acid and fatty acid production

> ② CO<sub>2</sub> effect

>> ○ CO<sub>2</sub> ↑ → CO<sub>2</sub> binding or acid increase at N-terminus → Hb conformational change → oxygen affinity ↓

>> ○ CO<sub>2 bonding at the N-terminus 

>> ○ Acid increase: If pCO<sub>2</sub> is high, pH is reduced to H + derived from carbonic acid.

>> ○ Reduced oxygen affinity allows hemoglobin to dissociate oxygen better in tissue cells

> ③ Temperature effect

>> ○ Temperature ↑ → Hb conformation change → Oxygen affinity ↓

>> ○ Actively metabolizing or exercising cells release heat

>> ○ Enzymes rapidly lose their activity as their intramolecular bonds weaken at temperatures after their activation temperature

> ④ 2,3-BPG (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate) effect

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/19sY2/btrzYFB07wM/e9fDaTzcUGO5liH5kSQ73k/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 6.</b> Action of 2,3-BPG</center>

>> ○ 2,3-BPG: Active production of glycolysis, isomer of 1,3-BPG, an intermediate product of glycolysis

>> ○ Mammalian erythrocytes have high concentrations of 2,3-BPG

>> ○ 2,3-BPG ↑ → Stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin by combining with β globin in the middle of hemoglobin → additional oxygen affinity ↓

>> ○ Oxygen affinity change during exercise 2: Tissue cell oxygen debt phenomenon → Some G3Ps convert to 2,3-BPG → Oxygen bond in β globin ↓

> ⑤ When moving to a high altitude mountain

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Reduction of partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Decreases the amount of oxygen binding of hemoglobin in the lungs

>>> ○ Increase respiratory rate to compensate for insufficient oxygen binding

>>> ○ Respiratory algorithm: Increasing respiratory rate releases excess CO2, increasing blood pH

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Decreased oxygen supply to tissue cells → Increased 2,3-BPG in red blood cells

>>> ○ Reduced oxygen affinity of hemoglobin releases more oxygen from oxygen hemoglobin

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Reduced oxygen supply to the kidneys

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>-1<sup>st</sup>. Increased erythropoietin secretion in the kidneys

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup>. Promote red blood cell production in bone marrow → increase red blood cell count

⑷ Carbon dioxide transport

> ① Plasma: 8%, simple diffusion (melting)

>> ○ CO<sub>2</sub> (g) → CO<sub>2</sub> (aq)

> ② Combined with hemoglobin: HbCO<sub>2</sub>, about 22%

> ③ Bicarbonate ion: HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, about 70%

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) simply diffuses from plasma to red blood cells

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Promoted by CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) → H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (_aq_), carbonic anhydrase (CA)

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> → H+ + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. H<sup>+</sup> combines with Hb to become HHb (See. ⑶-①)

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is one-to-one reverse cotransport with Cl<sup>-</sup> and discharged out of plasma

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Osmotic pressure causes water to enter as Cl<sup>-</sup> increases in erythrocytes → volume increases

⑸ Pulmonary and body circulation: Circulation and respiratory system harmony

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/conBSL/btrz2rCgsmz/3F2a2gkWQPmyFSlLqu55z0/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 8.</b> Pulmonary and body circulation</center>

<br>

> ① Pulmonary Circulation (12% Blood Retention)

>> ○ Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Pulmonary capillary → Pulmonary vein → Left atrium

>> ○ Blood with O<sub>2</sub>↓, CO<sub>2</sub>↑ → Blood with O<sub>2</sub>↑, CO<sub>2</sub>↓

> ② Circulation (79% blood retention)

>> ○ Left ventricle → aorta → artery → capillary → vein → vena cava → right atrium

>> ○ Blood with O<sub>2</sub>↑, CO<sub>2</sub>↓ → Blood with O<sub>2</sub>↓, CO<sub>2</sub↑

>>> ○ Aortic partial pressure: 80 to 100 mmHg

>>> ○ Venous oxygen partial pressure: 40 mmHg

>> ○ Supply nutrients and oxygen to tissue cells

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Control of breathing**

⑴ Control of number: Cortex → Cortex spinal cord → Motor neurons

⑵ Self-regulating central: Pontoon, training → voluntary, rhythmic activity

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/3TRUw/btrz34Gy0Qm/hMnr3fukD3J8AHdLtQGTAK/img.jpg" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

<center><b>Figure. 9.</b> Control of breathing</center>

<br>

> ① Soft water: Basic breathing control

>> ○ Soft water is more affected by carbon dioxide than oxygen

> ② Pons: Adjusts for smooth transition between inspiration and exhalation, breathing rate

> ③ Input and receiver

>> ○ Chemical receptors in the central nervous system (especially cerebrospinal fluid) (pO<sub>2</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup>)

>>> ○ H<sup>+</sup> cannot cross the brain-vascular barrier so chemical receptors determine H<sup>+</sup> by the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>

>>> ○ Increase metabolism through exercise → CO<sub>2</sub> ↑ → Increase respiration → Excessive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions → Normalize pH

>> ○ Input of chemical receptors (H<sup>+</sup>, pO<sub>2</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub>) of aortic bodies (next to the aortic arch) and carotid bodies (next to the carotid artery)

>>> ○ O<sub>2</sub> concentration does not have a significant effect on breathing, but increases respiration rate when O<sub>2</sub> levels are low

>> ○ Plasma epinephrine and potassium concentration receptors

>> ○ Muscle and joint kidney receptor input

>> ○ Renal Receptor Input to Lung

>> ○ Stimulation (temperature, etc.) input through other receptors and under Thalamus

> ④ Breathing control process

>> ○ Breathing exercise: Sympathetic stimulation, adrenaline secretion

>> ○ Respiratory movement suppression: Parasympathetic stimulation, acetylcholine secretion

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Acidosis and alkalosis**

⑴ Steady state

> ① PH: 7.41 to 7.45

> ② O<sub>2</sub>: 40 mmHg (tissue) or more 100 mmHg (lung) or less

> ③ CO<sub>2</sub>: 40 mmHg (lung) or more 46 mmHg (tissue) or less

> ④ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>: 24 mmEqmol

⑵ Acidosis and Alkalosis

> ① Acidosis: pH 7.35 or less

> ② Alkalosis: pH 7.45 or more

⑶ Metabolic alkalosis: Metabolism Excessive HCO3\-

> ① Excess HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reacts with H<sup>+</sup> resulting in high pH

> ② Compensation: Increased partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> by lowering breathing rate to lower pH

> ③ Example: Vomiting (exhaust acid from the stomach)

⑷ Metabolic acidosis: If HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is low due to metabolism

> ① Less HCO<sub>3</sub>sup>-</sup>, H<sup>+</sup> remains in the blood, resulting in lower pH

> ② Compensation: Lowers CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure by increasing respiration rate to increase pH

> ③ Example: Diarrhea (Bicarbonate Release)

⑸ Respiratory alkalosis: When the partial pressure of CO2 is lowered in relation to breathing

> ① Lower CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure results in higher blood pH

> ② Compensation: Suppresses HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>reaction to lower pH

> ③ Example: Hyperventilation, limited lung disease (e.g., Pulmonary fibrosis)

⑹ Respiratory acidosis: High CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure associated with respiration

> ① Low CO<sub>2</sub> pH due to no CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

> ② Compensation: Activate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup-</sup> reaction to increase pH

> ③ Example: Obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma)

<br>

<br>

## **7\. Lung disease**

⑴ Acidosis and Alkalosis

> ① Normal Conditions

>> ○ pH: 7.41 ~ 7.45  

>> ○ O<sub>2</sub>: ≥ 40 mmHg (tissue), ≤ 100 mmHg (lungs) 

>> ○ CO<sub>2</sub>: ≥ 40 mmHg (lungs), ≤ 46 mmHg (tissue)  

>> ○ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>: 24 mEq/mol  

> ② Acidosis and Alkalosis

>> ○ Acidosis: When pH is below 7.35  

>> ○ Alkalosis: When pH is above 7.45

**Figure 10.** Acidosis and Alkalosis

<br>

> ③ Metabolic Alkalosis: Caused by excessive HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> due to metabolism

>> ○ Excess HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> binds to H<sup>+</sup>, raising the pH  

>> ○ Compensation: Decreased respiratory rate to raise CO₂ partial pressure and lower pH  

>> ○ Example: Vomiting (loss of acidic gastric content)  

> ④ Metabolic Acidosis**: Caused by depletion of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> due to metabolism  

>> ○ Reduced HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> leaves more free H<sup>+</sup> in blood, lowering pH  

>> ○ Compensation: Increased respiratory rate to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure and raise pH  

>> ○ Example: Diarrhea (loss of bicarbonate from the body)  

> ⑤ Respiratory Alkalosis**: Caused by reduced CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure due to respiration
 
>> ○ Lower CO<sub>2</sub> leads to elevated blood pH  

>> ○ Compensation: Inhibition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production to lower pH  

>> ○ Example: Hyperventilation, restrictive lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis)  

>> ○ Narrowing of blood vessels including cerebral vessels may occur to prevent CO<sub>2</sub> loss, causing dizziness  

>> ○ Treatment for hyperventilation: Breathing into a paper bag to rebreathe exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>

> ⑥ Respiratory Acidosis: Caused by increased CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure due to impaired respiration  

>> ○ Retention of CO<sub>2</sub> lowers blood pH  

>> ○ Compensation: Activation of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production to raise pH  

>> ○ Example: Obstructive lung diseases (e.g., asthma)  

⑵ Lung Cancer

> ① **Type 1.** SCLC (Small Cell Lung Cancer): Accounts for 15% of all lung cancers.  

>> ○ Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are the primary treatments  

>> ○ Originates from neuroendocrine cells  

>> ○ Most cases are associated with heavy smoking  

>> ○ Surgery is rarely performed, so research samples are relatively limited  

> ② **Type 2.** NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer): Accounts for 85% of all lung cancers.  

>> ○ Surgery is the primary treatment; chemotherapy and radiation are secondary

>>> ○ EGFR mutation-driven  

>>> ○ Combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is being explored  

>>> ○ Originates from alveolar type II epithelial cells  

>> ○ **2-3. LCC (Large-Cell Carcinoma)**: Originates from various epithelial cells  

> ③ Lung Cancer and Smoking

>> ○ Tar and fine particles remain on lung surfaces, causing mutations and cancer  

>> ○ **Characteristics of cigarettes**:  
  
>>> ○ Contain around 100,000 chemicals  
  
>>> ○ About 20 classified as Group A carcinogens  
  
>>> ○ Major harmful substances: tar, carbon monoxide, nicotine  

>> ○ **Tar**: Cigarette residue, ~10 mg per cigarette  
  
>>> ○ Contains ~40 carcinogens  
  
>>> ○ Penetrates the bloodstream and destroys cells  
  
>>> ○ Disrupts immune system, induces chronic inflammation  
  
>>> ○ Damages cilia and elastin  

>> ○ **Carbon Monoxide**:  

>>> ○ Product of incomplete combustion  

>>> ○ Most abundant substance in cigarette smoke  

>>> ○ Main cause of chronic hypoxia, premature aging, and atherosclerosis  

>> ○ **Nicotine**: ~0.1 to 0.6 mg per cigarette  
  
>>> ○ Reaches the brain in ~7 seconds  
  
>>> ○ Addictive, narcotic, toxic; also used in pesticides and herbicides  
  
>>> ○ Increases blood pressure  

>> ○ Other toxic substances:  
  
>>> ○ **Benzo[a]pyrene**: Carcinogen  
  
>>> ○ **Dimethylnitrosamine**: Carcinogen  
  
>>> ○ **Hydrogen cyanide**: Lethal gas chamber toxin  
  
>>> ○ **Naphthylamine**: Preservative  
  
>>> ○ **Naphthalene**: Moth repellent  
  
>>> ○ **DDT**: Pesticide  

⑶ Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

> ① Symptoms: Increased mucus and narrowed airways (due to elastin dysfunction) increase airway resistance and cause ventilation impairment  

> ② **Feature 1**: Total lung capacity and residual volume are higher than normal (compensatory)  

> ③ **Feature 2**: Respiratory function is always lower than normal  

> ④ Rolipram: A clinical drug used to treat COPD  

> ⑤ **Example 1.** Chronic Bronchitis:  

>> ○ Excessive mucus secretion in bronchi → chronic inflammation in lower airways  

> ⑥ **Example 2.** Asthma:  

>> ○ **Causes**: Allergic reactions, viral infections, etc.  

>> ○ **Symptoms**: Alveolar constriction, increased mucus secretion, increased airway resistance, chronic inflammation  

>> ○ Fine particles exacerbate asthma  

> ⑦ **Example 3.** Emphysema:

>> ○ Caused by scar tissue formation due to bronchitis and asthma  

>> ○ Destruction and blockage of small airways → reduced alveoli count and surface area  

>> ○ Irreversible  

⑷ Restrictive Lung Diseases

> ① Symptoms: Reduced lung compliance (ability to expand), leading to ventilation impairment  

> ② **Feature 1**: Total lung capacity and residual volume are lower than normal  

> ③ **Feature 2**: Respiratory function is comparable to normal within a limited range  

> ④ **Example 1. Pulmonary Fibrosis**

>> ○ Subtypes:  
  
>>> ○ IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)  
  
>>> ○ cHP (Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis)  
  
>>> ○ NSIP (Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia)  
  
>>> ○ Sarcoidosis  
  
>>> ○ Unclassifiable ILD  

>> ○ Consolidation: Lung appears completely white  

>> ○ Crazy paving: Thickened blood vessels  

>> ○ Treatment: Nintedanib, Pirfenidone (target tyrosine kinases)  

> ⑤ **Example 2.** Pneumoconiosis, Tuberculosis

> ⑥ **Example 3.** Occupational Lung Disease

>> ○ Fine dust (asbestos, coal dust, silica, paper dust, pollen, etc.) accumulates in macrophages  

>> ○ Scar tissue replaces lung tissue → fibrous cysts, reduced lung flexibility  

⑸ Pulmonary Edema

> ① Definition: A condition in which fluid leaks into alveoli as pulmonary veins exceed lymphatic drainage capacity  

>> ○ Lymphatic drainage: Ability to recover interstitial and lymph fluid from pulmonary capillaries  

> ② Causes**:  

>> ○ Heart failure → increased pulmonary venous pressure  

>> ○ Decrease in external air pressure  

> ③ Symptoms: Causes shortness of breath  

⑹ ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)

> ① **Example**: Post-SARS-CoV-2 lung disease
