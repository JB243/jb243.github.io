## **1\. Overview of the Animal Immune System** 

⑴ Innate Immunity (Nonspecific Immunity): Present in all animals

⒃ Mechanisms of antigen elimination by antibodies

> ① Opsonization: Antibodies bind to antigens, enhancing the phagocytic activity of phagocytes (neutrophils and macrophages).

>> ○ IgG is most commonly involved in opsonization.

>> ○ Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

>>> ○ Opsonized antigens are recognized by Tc cells and NK cells.

>>> ○ Antigens bound by IgG antibodies are more easily killed by macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells.

>>> ○ Involves FcγRII, FcγRIII, and other receptors.

>> ○ Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).

>> ○ Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).

> ② Neutralization: Antibodies bind to antigens, preventing their penetration into host cells and neutralizing their harmful effects.

> ③ Agglutination and precipitation reactions

>> ○ Agglutination: Antibodies bind to antigens, causing clumping and making them targets for phagocytosis.

>> ○ Precipitation: Antibodies bind to antigens, making them heavier and causing them to settle.

> ④ Complement system activation and formation of membrane attack complex (MAC)

>> ○ Also known as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of foreign cells, activating the complement system.

>>> ○ Both Fab, which binds to antigens, and Fc, which binds to the complement system, are required for complement activation.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Upon complement system activation, membrane attack complexes are formed and create pores in the cell membrane of foreign cells.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Water and ions enter the cell through the pores, causing cell swelling and leakage of cellular contents, ultimately leading to cell death.

⒄ Polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies

> ① Polyclonal antibodies

>> ○ A collection of B lymphocytes that produce various types of antibodies.

>> ○ It means that individual B lymphocytes produce different antibodies, not that one B lymphocyte produces multiple antibodies.

> ② Monoclonal antibodies

>> ○ A collection of B lymphocytes that produce a single type of antibody.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Spleen cells (SC) are extracted: Contains B lymphocytes.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Hybridoma generation: Fusion of immortal myeloma cells (MC) with spleen cells.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Hybridomas proliferate and become hybridoma cells: As the number of hybridomas increases, a large amount of a single type of antibody is produced.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Cultivate in HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine) medium to extract viable cells.

>>> ○ Survival requires the presence of HGPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase), an enzyme secreted by SC.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Expected results:

## **7. T Cells vs. B Cells** 

⑴ Naive T cells have a relatively smooth surface, but naive B cells have a rough surface (due to higher BCR expression).

⑵ Mechanisms of antigen receptor diversity:

|   | T Cells | B Cells |
|---|---|---|
| Variable region assembly | Occurs (through gene rearrangement) | Occurs (through gene rearrangement) |
| Junctional diversity | Occurs (joining of α and β chains) | Occurs (joining of heavy and light chains) |
| Alternative splicing | Does not occur | Occurs (IgM → IgG) |
| Class switch recombination | Does not occur | Occurs (secondary gene rearrangement) |
| Somatic hypermutation | Does not occur | Occurs (point mutations) |

<center><b>Table 4.</b> Comparison of mechanisms for antigen receptor diversity</center>

<br>

> ① Genes involved in antibody production: 20,000 genes

> ② Through DNA rearrangement in B cells and T cells, millions to billions of antigen receptors and antibodies can be generated.

<br>

<br>

## **8. Immune System Disorders** 

⑴ Infectious diseases:

> ① Viral diseases, etc.

> ② Vaccines: Formation of memory cells in B cells.

⑵ Autoimmune diseases:

> ① Rh blood type: Forms protein antigen memory cells and generates IgG antibodies.

> ② In the case of Rh (+), it has the D antigen and does not produce anti-D antibodies.

> ③ In the case of Rh (-) mothers, initially they do not have the D antigen or anti-D antibodies.

>> ○ If the first child is Rh (+), during delivery, when fetal blood mixes with the mother's blood through a small wound, the mother produces antibodies against the Rh antigen.

>> ○ If the second child is also Rh (+), the mother's IgG crosses the placenta and causes hemolysis of the fetus's red blood cells.

>> ○ Administering anti-D antibodies around 7 months and after childbirth can prevent the formation of memory cells.

>> ○ Antibodies against the D antigen, such as RhoGAM, can perform the immune response in place of the mother.

> ④ ABO blood type: Involves carbohydrate antigens.

>> ○ Since they are carbohydrates, they do not form memory cells, and only IgM antibodies are produced.

>> ○ IgM cannot pass through the placenta, so it does not harm a fetus with a different blood type even if the mother is pregnant with such a fetus.

>> ○ Anti-A antibodies and anti-B antibodies are antibodies produced when infected with bacteria that lack respective A and B antigens and have similar characteristics to self.

⑶ Immune rejection

> ① Transplant immunology

>> ○ Specificity and memory of allograft rejection reactions

>>> ○ Assuming a rejection reaction occurred when tissue A was first transplanted into B.

>>> ○ If tissue A is transplanted into B for the second time, the rejection reaction occurs faster than the first transplantation.

>>> ○ When tissue C is transplanted into B, B recognizes C differently and exhibits primary immune response → A and C are perceived diffe>> rently.

>> ○ CD4 T cells play an important role in transplant rejection reactions.

>> ○ The success rate of allogeneic transplantation depends on antigen similarity (tissue compatibility), with MHC genes being the most closely related.

> ② Organ transplantation

>> ○ Phenomenon where Th cells and Tc cells of the **recipient** attack the transplanted organ.

>> ○ Recognition of organs with different MHC types as antigens.

>> ○ Bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, veins, skin, and cornea are relatively less susceptible to immune rejection.

>> ○ Success rate of sibling organ transplantation = Probability of having the same 6<sup>th</sup> chromosome = 25% ≫ Success rate of parent-child organ transplantation.

>> ○ Generally, immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine are administered to the recipient before organ transplantation.

>> ○ Even if MHC types are the same, if the sexes are different, a specific protein of _SRY_ (e.g., _smyc_) acts as an antigen, leading to immune rejection.

>> ○ [Microcytotoxicity test](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1474)

> ③ Bone marrow transplantation

>> ○ Phenomenon where Th cells and Tc cells in the transplant graft react against the recipient's organs.

>> ○ Most patients experience graft-versus-host reaction, and 30-50% of them have severe symptoms.

>> ○ As a treatment for graft-versus-host reaction, bone marrow is pretreated by radiation to remove lymphocytes before transplantation.

> ④ Immunological privilege

>> ○ Prevention of immune cell influx and removal of immune cells through close adhesion.

>> ○ Examples: eyeball, testis, brain.

⑷ Immune hypersensitivity reactions

> ① Type I hypersensitivity

>> ○ IgE-mediated

>> ○ Involvement of mast cells, peripheral blood basophils (PBB), etc.

> ○ Symptoms: allergic rhinitis to anaphylaxis

> ② 1-1. Allergy: Acute hypersensitivity reaction, similar to parasitic immunity.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>: Initial exposure to allergens → IgE production and binding of Fc region to mast cells, basophils, and eosi>>> nophils.

>>> ○ Allergen: Substance that triggers allergies, such as food, pollen, insect venom, etc.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>: Secondary exposure to the same allergen → IgE attached to mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils recognize and bind to the allergen.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>: Cross-linking of allergen-bound IgE molecules.

>>> ○ Allergic reaction requires a sufficient amount of IgE to be cross-linked.

>>> ○ Anti-IgE receptor antibodies can also trigger allergic reactions because both antigen-binding sites send signals to the IgE receptor simultaneously.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>: Mast cell degranulation induced → Excessive release of histamine, serotonin, leukotrienes, etc., from mast cells.

>>> ○ Histamine: Smooth muscle contraction in bronchioles, relaxation of vascular smooth muscles (increased vascular permeability).

>>> ○ Allergic reactions are inhibited in hypocalcemia since calcium ion influx is required for mast cell degranulation.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>: Allergic symptoms (e.g., flushing, asthma, inflammatory response) appear.

>> ○ Treatment: Epinephrine - allergy treatment, increases lowered blood pressure and relaxes airways.

> ③ 1-2. Delayed hypersensitivity: Reaction that occurs several hours after contact with an antigen.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>: Antigen invasion.

>>> ○ Examples: Mycobacterium tuberculosis infecting the lungs.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>: Mutual activation of macrophages and Th1 cells - a prolonged reaction.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>: Activation of Tc cells by Th1.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>: Hyperactivity of Tc cells.

>> ○ Treatment: Corticosteroids.

> ④ 1-3. Antibody-mediated hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic shock.

>> ○ Involvement of IgE as a representative.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>: Organic substances (e.g., penicillin, aspirin) that provide antigenicity enter the bloodstream.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>: Increased antibodies against the organic substances.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>: Systemic allergic reaction upon secondary exposure to the substances in the bloodstream.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>: Increased vascular permeability and smooth muscle relaxation throughout the body → Accelerated leakage of blood into tissues, resulting in decreased blood pressure.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>: Acute shock reaction.

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>: Compensation mechanism for smooth muscle relaxation leads to contraction of other smooth muscles → Contraction of airway smooth muscles → Respiratory distress.

>> ○ Example: Penicillin.

>>> ○ Penicillin has a β-lactam ring.

>>> ○ The β-lactam ring is non-immunogenic as a non-protein, but it forms a hapten by conjugating with host proteins.

>>> ○ Haptens can trigger allergic reactions.

> ⑤ Type II hypersensitivity: Non-IgE-mediated.

> ⑥ **2-1.** Complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA)

>> ○ Mechanism: Immune complex → Activation of complement → Precipitation on the basement membrane. IgE is not involved.

>> ○ 77% of hypersensitivity reactions

>> ○ Example: RCM (radiocontrast media), liposomes, micelles, Cremophor EL (CrEL) in Taxol

⑸ Autoimmune disease: Immune response occurs against self-antigens due to the failure of clonal deletion.

> ① Systemic erythematous lupus

>> ○ Possess antibodies against DNA and nuclear proteins, induce inflammatory response, and have B cells that produce excessive antibodies.

> ② Rheumatoid arthritis

>> ○ Onset: Reduced activity of CTLA4 (a protein that inhibits the reaction of T cells with self-antigens) allows self-recognizing T cells to enter the joints and cause inflammation.

> ③ Multiple sclerosis

>> ○ Onset: T cells attack myelin surrounding nerve fibers (autoimmune demyelinating disease).

>> ○ Symptoms: Fatigue, facial and limb paralysis, sexual dysfunction, impaired balance, dizziness, depression, etc.

> ④ Myasthenia gravis

>> ○ Onset: Antibodies are generated against acetylcholine receptors in skeletal muscles, leading to muscle weakness.

> ⑤ Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes)

>> ○ T cells attack beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.

> ⑥ Hashimoto's thyroiditis

>> ○ T cells attack thyroid cells.

> ⑦ Guillain-Barré syndrome

>> ○ Stiffness starting from the extremities.

> ⑧ Systemic lupus erythematosus

> ⑨ Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)

>> ○ The most well-studied animal model of autoimmune disease.

>> ○ Induction of diseases such as multiple sclerosis is possible with T cells alone.

> ⑩ Agammaglobulinemia

⑹ Immunodeficiency disorders

> ① Congenital immunodeficiency disorders

>> ○ Genetic or developmental abnormalities in the immune system.

>> ○ Example: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) → Congenital lymphocyte impairment → Treatment: Gene insertion into the bone marrow.

> ② Acquired immunodeficiency disorders

>> ○ Occur during life due to exposure to chemicals or physiological substances.

>> ○ Example: Hodgkin's disease (lymphatic system damage cancer), AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)

> ③ Immunodeficient mice

>> ○ SCID mice: rag gene-deficient mice

>> ○ Nude mice: thymus-deficient mice

⑺ Immune evasion

> ① Antigenic variation: Changes in epitope expression.

>> ○ **Example 1:** Trypanosomes causing sleeping sickness randomly change surface proteins.

>> ○ **Example 2:** Influenza viruses, RNA viruses (high mutation rate)

>> ○ HIV reverse transcriptase is prone to errors.

> ② Latency

>> ○ A phenomenon where viruses reside in an inactive state without stimulating the host's immune defense system.

>> ○ Virus DNA exists independently in the nucleus or inserted into the host genome.

>> ○ Activation conditions: Conditions where the host's survival is difficult and conditions favorable for virus transmission.

>> ○ Example: Herpes simplex virus (DNA virus)

>>> ○ Type 1 (oral virus): primarily infects lips, face, and eyes.

>>> ○ Type 2 (genital virus): primarily infects the external genitalia and perianal area.

>>> ○ Latency in sensory neurons: Sensory neurons have low expression of MHC class I, making antigen presentation inefficient.

> ③ AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome): Immune attack by HIV virus

>> ○ Cause: Immunodeficiency caused by HIV

>>> ○ Altered antigen presentation due to MHC class I mutation in HIV-infected T4 cells.

>>> ○ Altered antigen presentation due to MHC class II mutation in HIV-infected antigen-presenting cells.

>>> ○ Failure of antigen recognition due to abnormalities in the receptors of HIV-infected helper T cells → Loss of proper function of helper T lymphocytes → Opportunistic infections occur.

>> ○ Onset:

>>> ○ Transmission occurs only through contact with bodily fluids such as semen, blood, vaginal fluids, and rarely breast milk.

>>> ○ Early stage: HIV primarily infects antigen-presenting cells, helper T cells, and macrophages present in the blood and tissues. Inflammatory symptoms similar to flu.

>>> ○ Late stage: Virus is transmitted to major lymph nodes by antigen-presenting cells, helper T cells, and macrophages.

  <center><b>Figure. 11.</b> Progess after infection</center>

<br>

>> ○ Progression:

>>> ○ **Stage 1:** Infection: Virus levels reach a peak but are suppressed by the immune system. Influenza-like symptoms. High levels of helper T cells, increasing antibodies, a pulse graph of virus.

>>> ○ **Stage 2:** Asymptomatic: The virus is almost absent in the blood, and the person appears healthy.

>>> ○ **Stage 3:** AIDS: Increased virus levels and decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell levels. Opportunistic infections occur.

>>>> ○ Decreased helper T cells, decreased antibodies, increased virus.

>>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>: Lymph node swelling

>>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>: Infections by bacteria and fungi on the skin and oral cavity

>>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>: Kaposi's sarcoma

>>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>: Tuberculosis

>>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>: Pneumonia

>>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>: Lymphoma

>>>> ○ 7<sup>th</sup>: Cytomegalovirus infection

>> ○ Treatment: AZT (azidothymidine)

>>> ○ Contains an azide functional group (-N3) at the 3' end.

>>> ○ Once AZT participates in the reverse transcription process, further chain extension becomes impossible, blocking the reverse transcription process.

>>> ○ Theoretically, can treat all RNA viruses that use the reverse transcription process.

>>> ○ AZT acts as a competitive inhibitor.

>>> ○ AZT targets RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, so it does not cause significant problems in normal cells.

>> ○ Treatment: Crixivan (one of the HIV protease inhibitors used as an AIDS treatment)

>> ○ HIV vaccines have been under development since 1987, but no approved vaccines are available yet.
