## 1. Ras

⑴ Involved in signal transduction as a GPCR activated by tyrosine kinases.

⑵ Plays a key role in activating MAPK.

⑶ Normal functions: cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival.

⑷ Ras is further classified into H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras.

⑸ Hyperactivation of Ras can occur when GTPase-activating protein function is lost or when degradation-resistant proteins accumulate.

⑹ As a result, Ras can drive growth factor–independent cell proliferation, leading to oncogenic transformation.

⑺ Most growth factor–independent proliferation in cancer is caused by Ras activation.

## 2. K-Ras

⑴ K-Ras was discovered in 1983 as the first human oncogene.

⑵ It is one of the most common oncogenes, with K-Ras, H-Ras, and N-Ras mutations found in about 30% of all cancers.

⑶ Until 2021, no drugs targeting K-Ras–driven tumors had been approved.

> ① This has led major pharmaceutical companies to heavily invest in K-Ras–targeted drug development.

⑷ **LUSC (Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma)**:

> ① Accounts for 45% of all lung cancers.

> ② Smoke-driven.

> ③ Involves K-Ras.

> ④ Originates from basal epithelial cells.

⑸ **Type 1.** K-Ras G12C

> ① Two currently approved direct K-Ras G12C inhibitors: **Sotorasib** and **Adagrasib**.

> ② **Lumakras** (brand name) – **Sotorasib** (generic name)

>> ○ Target: **KRAS** 
   
>> ○ Drug class: **Signaling inhibitor**
   
>> ○ Indication: **NSCLC** (non-small cell lung cancer) 
   
>> ○ FDA approval: **2021**

⑹ **Type 2.** K-Ras G12D

> ① One of the neoantigens formed in cancer cells when a specific mutation occurs in tumor DNA, creating a completely novel protein not present in normal cells.

⑺ **Type 3.** B-Raf Mutation

> ① Relationship between BRAF and K-Ras: part of the **RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK signaling cascade** (MAPK pathway).

> ② B-Raf mutations were discovered in **2002**.

> ③ The first drug targeting B-Raf was approved in **2011**.
