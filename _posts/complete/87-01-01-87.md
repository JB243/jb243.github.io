<br>

## **2. Nitrogenous Wastes**

⑴ Generation of Nitrogenous Wastes

> ① Amino Acid Breakdown: Reaction in which amino groups are removed during amino acid metabolism, producing ammonia

>> ○ Liver combines ammonia with CO2 via the ornithine cycle to synthesize urea

>>> ○ Via mitochondria and cytoplasm 

>>> ○ Urea formation occurs in the cytoplasm

>> ○ Kidneys secrete ammonia into renal tubules

>> ○ Amino Group Transfer Reaction (Glutamine, Asparagine): The reaction that transfers an amino group to 2-oxalic acid.

> ② Nucleic acid degradation: Purines produce uric acid

>> ○ Humans lack the enzyme for uric acid degradation

>> ○ 25% is excreted through the digestive system, 75% through the kidneys

>> ○ If uric acid cannot be excreted and accumulates, it leads to gout and uric acid stones (composed of uric acid, phosphate, calcium, oxalate, etc.)

>> ○ Gout: Major causes include genetics, kidney disease, medications, diabetes, and alcohol consumption

**Figure 2.** Types of Nitrogenous Wastes

<br>

> ① Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)

>> ○ Characteristics: High solubility, high toxicity (because ammonia readily accepts H<sup>+</sup> ions)

>> ○ Water requirement during excretion: 1 mL per 1 g of nitrogen

>> ○ Relevant animals: Mostly bony fish, aquatic invertebrates

> ② Urea (Harnstoff)

>> ○ Characteristics: Much weaker toxicity compared to ammonia (10,000 times), excretable in concentrated form

>> ○ Energy required for urea synthesis

>> ○ Water requirement during excretion: 1 mL per 50 g of nitrogen

>> ○ Relevant animals: Mostly mammals, amphibians, cartilaginous fish, some bony fish

> ③ Uric Acid

>> ○ Characteristics: Non-toxic, low solubility (semi-solid state), minimal water consumption during excretion (water-saving effect)

>> ○ Requires more energy than urea synthesis

>> ○ Water requirement during excretion: 1 mL per 500 g of nitrogen

>> ○ Relevant animals: Birds, reptiles, terrestrial arthropods

⑶ Effects of evolution and environment on nitrogenous waste

> ① Methods of excreting waste while preventing water loss: urea, uric acid

> ② Determination by reproductive method

>> ○ Amphibian eggs without shells, mammalian embryos: choose water-soluble excretion (urea is highly toxic when accumulated)

>> ○ Bird and reptile eggs with shells: uric acid (non-toxic even when accumulated)

> ③ Determination by habitat

>> ○ Example: terrestrial turtles (uric acid), aquatic turtles (urea, ammonia)

> ④ Endotherms produce more nitrogenous waste than ectotherms

<br>

<br>

## **3. Types of Excretory Systems**

⑴ Protonephridia (flame-cell system): Excretory system of flatworms

> ① The protonephridial network branches like a tree; at each terminal is a flame bulb (composed of a terminal/cap cell and a tubule cell).

>> ○ The name comes from its flame-like appearance.

> ② Interstitial fluid is filtered across the membrane at the junction between the terminal (cap) cell and the tubule cell.

⑵ Metanephridia: The annelid excretory system responsible for osmoregulation and waste excretion

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Coelomic fluid enters the metanephridium through a ciliated nephrostome.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. As it flows along, tubule cells modify the composition of the filtrate.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The resulting dilute urine is expelled to the outside through a nephridiopore.

⑶ Malpighian tubules: Excretory system of terrestrial arthropods

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Salts, water, and nitrogenous wastes enter the Malpighian tubules.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Urine is passed into the hindgut with the feces.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Feces and urine are eliminated through the anus.

⑷ Kidneys: Excretory system of vertebrates

<br>

<br>

## **4. Structure of Kidneys**

⑴ Pathway of urine formation: nephron → collecting duct → renal pelvis → ureter → urinary bladder → urethra

> ① Renal cortex: nephron

> ② Renal medulla: loop of Henle (Henle loop) of the nephron, collecting ducts, renal pelvis

> ③ Related blood vessels: afferent arteriole → peritubular capillaries → efferent arteriole

⑵ Nephron

> ① Functional unit of kidneys, each kidney has 1.25 million nephrons (totaling 145 km), composed of Malpighian body and renal tubule

> ② Malpighian body: Collectively refers to glomerulus and Bowman's capsule, located in the renal cortex

>> ○ Glomerulus: A cluster of capillaries

>> ○ Bowman's Capsule: Double-layered capsule surrounding the glomerulus

> ③ Renal Tubule

>> ○ Macula Densa: Cells surrounding the renal tubule, prevents free movement of ions by tight junctions

>> ○ Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): Present in the cortex. Close to the afferent arteriole

>> ○ Henle's Loop: Present in the medulla. **Found only in mammals and birds**

>> ○ Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Present in the cortex. Close to the efferent arteriole

> ④ Cortical Nephron, Juxtamedullary Nephron

>> ○ Nephrons span both the renal cortex and medulla

>> ○ Cortical Nephron: Nephron with a bias toward the cortex

>> ○ Juxtamedullary Nephron: Nephron with a bias toward the medulla

> ⑤ Intercalated Cells: Present in the DCT and collecting duct

>> ○ Type A Intercalated Cells: Active during acidosis. Secrete H<sup>+</sup> into the lumen. Reabsorb HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Reabsorb K+

>> ○ Type B Intercalated Cells: Active during alkalosis. Reabsorb H+. Secrete HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Secrete K+

## **5. Kidney Functions**

  ⑴ 20-25% of cardiac output (500-600 mL/minute) passes through the afferent arterioles

  ⑵ Filtration, Reabsorption, Secretion, Excretion

> ① Filtration: Nonselective filtration of low-molecular-weight substances (H2O, salts, etc.) at the glomerulus.

> ② Reabsorption: Transport epithelial cells return useful components from the filtrate back into the body fluids.

> ③ Secretion: Toxic substances or excess ions are secreted from the body fluids (capillaries) into the filtrate (tubules).

> ④ Excretion: The filtrate leaves the kidney and is expelled from the body.

  ⑶ 1<sup>st</sup>. **Filtration**

> ① Glomerular Filtration Pressure: Driving force for filtration

>> ○ Glomerular Filtration Pressure = Glomerular Capillary Pressure (Blood Pressure) - (Bowman's Capsule Hydrostatic Pressure + Plasma Colloid Osmotic Pressure) = 55 - (30 + 15) = 10 (mmHg)

>> ○ Plasma Colloid Osmotic Pressure: Caused by proteins in the blood that pull water back into the blood

>> ○ Bowman's Capsule Hydrostatic Pressure: The back pressure generated within Bowman’s capsule acts as a resistance.

> ② Difference in blood flow between afferent and efferent arterioles determines filtration rate

>> ○ Afferent arterioles are larger in diameter compared to efferent arterioles

>> ○ Constriction of afferent arterioles: Decreases blood flow to glomerular capillaries, reducing glomerular capillary pressure **→** Decreased filtration rate

>> ○ Constriction of efferent arterioles: Limits blood outflow, increasing glomerular capillary pressure **→** Increased filtration rate

>> ○ Dilation of afferent arterioles: Increases blood flow to glomerular capillaries, raising glomerular capillary pressure **→** Increased filtration rate

>> ○ Dilation of efferent arterioles: Facilitates blood outflow, decreasing glomerular capillary pressure **→** Decreased filtration rate

>> ○ Vasoconstriction: Increases pressure in the arterial portion, decreases in the venous portion

> ③ Filtration Rate

>> ○ Renal Blood Flow (RBF) (unit: mL/min): Blood flow through renal vessels in 1 minute

>> ○ Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) (unit: mL/min): Plasma flow through renal vessels in 1 minute

>> ○ Renal Threshold: Concentration at which a substance starts to be secreted

>> ○ Blood Hematocrit = Plasma / Blood = RPF / RBF

>> ○ Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (unit: mL/min): The volume of glomerular filtrate produced per minute

>>> ○ Typically 125 mL/min = 180 L/day

>>> ○ The 100 mL/min shown in the calculation below is an adjusted value for ease of calculation

>> ○ Clearance (CL) (unit: mL/min): The amount of urine produced per minute

>> ○ **PAH**: Completely removed from the plasma.

>> ○ **Creatine**: Undergoes neither tubular secretion nor reabsorption.

>>> ○ Produced by the breakdown of creatine phosphate in muscle; generated at a fairly constant rate in the body.

>>> ○ Cleared by the kidneys and often used to measure GFR.

>>> ○ Used as a safety marker for renal function.

>> ○ **Inulin**: Undergoes neither tubular secretion nor reabsorption

>> ○ Filtration-rate calculation chart: Calculations of filtration rate, etc., can be understood by the law of conservation of mass.

<br>

> ④ Regulation of GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)

>> ○ Afferent Arteriole: Constriction decreases RPF (Renal Plasma Flow) and GFR, Dilation increases RPF and GFR

>> ○ Efferent Arteriole: Constriction decreases RPF, increases GFR, Dilation increases RPF, decreases GFR

<br>

>> ○ **Component 1:** Capillary endothelial cell: Refers to fenestrae or pores, allowing the passage of substances smaller than 70 nm.

>> ○ **Component 2:** Glomerular basement membrane: High collagen density, negatively charged, allows passage of substances smaller than 6-6.5 nm.

<br>

> ③ Glomerulus → Proximal Convoluted Tubule → <span style="color: red">Descending Limb of Henle</span> → Ascending Limb of Henle → Distal Convoluted Tubule → Collecting Duct

>> ○ Descending Limb of Henle: Water can pass through, but NaCl cannot; AQP-1 is expressed.

>> ○ Water exchange between Descending Limb of Henle and renal medulla

>>> ○ Osmolarity comparison: Filtrate < Renal medulla

>>> ○ Filtrate gets concentrated as water is reabsorbed from the descending limb of Henle to renal medulla.

>>> ○ Without countercurrent multiplication, renal medulla remains diluted.

>> ○ Water exchange between the vasa recta and the renal medulla

>>> ○ Restoration of osmolarity: The osmotic concentration within the vasa recta increases toward the bottom of the loop of Henle, then decreases as it ascends by taking up water.

>>> ○ When Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in the vasa recta is high, the vasa recta absorbs more water, leading to an increase in blood pressure.

> ④ Glomerulus → Proximal Convoluted Tubule → Descending Limb of Henle → <span style="color: red">Ascending Limb of Henle</span> → Distal Convoluted Tubule → Collecting Duct

>> ○ Water cannot pass through, but NaCl can, resulting in NaCl reabsorption.

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. The signal of macula densa stimulates granular cells

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Granular cells secrete renin

>>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup>. Renin converts angiotensinogen, which is secreted by the liver, into angiotensin I.

>>> ○ 7<sup>th</sup>. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)

>>> ○ 8<sup>th</sup>. Mechanisms to conserve water, including aldosterone, are activated

>> ○ Na<sup>+</sup>-K+ Pump: The macula densa moves 3 Na<sup>+</sup> ions out and 2 K<sup>+</sup> ions into cells

>>> ○ Along the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient, the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter of the macula densa cells reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup> from the tubular lumen.

>>> ○ Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption (Active transport) → Cl- reabsorption (Passive transport) for charge balance

> ⑥ Glomerulus → Proximal Convoluted Tubule → Descending Limb of Henle → Ascending Limb of Henle → Distal Convoluted Tubule → <span style="color: red">Collecting Duct</span>

>> ○ Conditional expression of Na<sup>+</sup> pump regulated by RAAS

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Decreased water → Decreased GFR

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Slower filtrate generation → Increased Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption in thick Ascending Limb

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Dilute urine stimulates macula densa

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. The signal of macula densa stimulates granular cells

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Granular cells secrete renin

>>> ○ Type B intercalated cells: ↓ H<sup>+</sup> → ↓ K<sup>+</sup> → hypokalemia

>>> ○ Changes in H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> move in the same direction.

>> ○ Urea reabsorption: urea is continuously stored in the renal medulla (∴ reabsorption of urea), thereby increasing the osmolarity of the renal medulla **[Countercurrent multiplication 2]**

>> ○ Part of the urea stored in the renal medulla moves back into the filtrate fluid of the loop of Henle.

> ⑦ Changes in osmolarity of the vasa recta adjacent to the loop of Henle

>> ○ As blood descends in the vasa recta, its osmolarity increases.

>> ○ As blood ascends in the vasa recta, its osmolarity decreases.

>> ○ Therefore, the net change in osmolarity of the blood passing through the kidney is nearly zero.

 ⑸ 3<sup>rd</sup>. **Excretion**

> ① Urine excretion: 1.5 liters/day

> ① Secreted from atrial pressure receptors in the left atrium: Secretion increases when atrial receptors are stretched more than normal.

> ② Inhibits RAAS, promotes ADH antagonism.

> ③ Promotes excretion of salt (sodium, etc.) and water in the kidneys → Decreases blood pressure → Reduces body weight.

> ④ Prevents strain on the heart due to excessive fluid.

 ⑷ Autonomic Nervous System

> ① Sympathetic Nervous System: Relaxation of bladder smooth muscles (sensation of needing to urinate), contraction of urethral smooth muscles (prevents urine release).

> ② Parasympathetic Nervous System: Contraction of bladder smooth muscles, relaxation of urethral smooth muscles.

> ③ Somatic motor neurons induce contraction of the urethral sphincter.

## **7. Kidney Disorders** 

⑴ Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)

⑵ Diabetes Insipidus

> ① Central diabetes insipidus: pituitary defect → normal with ADH administration

> ② Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: defect in ADH receptors

⑶ Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

> ① COVID-19 infection can also cause acute kidney injury

> ② Treatment: AMF (amifostine)

⑷ Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

**Table. 4.** Classification of CKD

<br>

⑸ Blood-related disease

> ① Acidosis, Alkalosis

> ② Hyperaldosteronism: Metabolic alkalosis

> ③ Hypoaldosteronism: Metabolic acidosis

> ④ Hypokalemia → Decreased H<sup>+</sup>

⑹ Renal Transplantation

> ① In renal transplantation, the kidney must be removed, and a new kidney must be transplanted within 48 hours.

<br>

<br>

## **8. Sweat** 

⑴ Functions of Sweat

> ① Temperature regulation: Utilizes the evaporation of sweat to lower elevated body temperature

> ② Prevention of edema: vigorous exercise → increased arteriolar blood pressure → increased permeability of capillaries → edema → prevented by water loss through sweating.

⑵ In sweat glands, ACh is secreted from postganglionic neurons.
