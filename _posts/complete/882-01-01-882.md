## **3. CPU** (central processing unit)

⑴ Intel vs AMD

> ① Compatibility (Intel) vs Stability (AMD)

> ② Latest specifications: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, etc.

<br>

<br>

## **4. RAM** (random access memory)

⑴ [SRAM vs DRAM](https://jb243.github.io/pages/922#footnote_link_67_55)

⑵ In the field of bioinformatics, using RStudio extensively, 128 GB of RAM is recommended to ensure smooth bioinformatics analysis.

<br>

<br>

## **5. Drive**

⑴ SSD vs HDD

> ① SSDs are fast but expensive, HDDs are slow but cheaper.

>> ○ HDD prices are very low unless using Dell drives (1 million KRW per pentabyte).

> ② This leads to the general practice of using SSDs for computation and HDDs for storage and backup.

> ③ For an 8 million KRW Linux server for bioinformatics, using an SSD of 4 TB and an HDD of 8 TB provides a balanced feeling.

⑵ [Synology NAS](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2247)

⑶ Cloud Services: When dealing with large datasets, consider using cloud-based drives over local ones.

> ① Naver Cloud

> ② SK Data Center

> ③ Amazon

> ④ Google

<br>

<br>

## **6. Frame**

⑴ Rack vs Tower

> ① Rack > Tower: Rack servers are preferred due to easier management like stacking.

> ② Rack < Tower

>> ○ Building rack servers requires careful noise and heat management.

>> ○ Tower servers usually have better internal heat dissipation.

>> ○ Unless a separate server room with 24/7 air conditioning is available, tower servers are recommended.

<br>

<br>

## **7. Miscellaneous**

⑴ Individual servers (workstations) cost around 8 to 10 million KRW.

⑵ For server setups around 150 million KRW, switch equipment and bandwidth need to be considered.

⑶ Given rising electricity costs, server specs with high energy efficiency are preferred.

⑷ Many second-hand server equipment becomes available towards the end of the year.

> ① In 2016, a server costing 10 million KRW could now be assembled for around 300,000 KRW: Comparable to a personal PC.
