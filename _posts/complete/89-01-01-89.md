## **1. Endocrine System**

 ⑴ Endocrine: Transmission of signals without ducts

 ⑵ Types of endocrine signaling

> ① Autocrine: When a cell secretes an endocrine substance that acts on itself.

>> ○ Examples: Tumor cells and growth factors, IL-2 from activated helper T cells, Growth factors from gastric cells.

> ② Paracrine: Signaling to neighboring cells

>> ○ Example: Growth factors, interleukins, prostaglandins, histamine

>> ○ Insulin-like growth factor (IGF): Secreted by the liver

>> ○ Prostaglandin: promotes gastric mucin secretion, platelet release reaction, immune activity, and uterine contraction. Due to its unstable molecular structure, it functions as a local regulator.

>> ○ Histamine: stimulates gastric acid secretion; induces bronchial smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion; promotes mental alertness; causes vasodilation during inflammatory responses; induces uterine contraction; and relaxes smooth muscle.

> ③ Neurotransmitter: Electric signals, released at synapses

>> ○ Example: Acetylcholine

> ④ Endocrine: Secreted into the bloodstream

>> ○ Example: Hormones

> ⑤ Exocrine: Secreted into external body cavities

>> ○ Example: Digestive enzymes, pheromones

 ⑶ Characteristics of hormones

> ① Chemical substances regulating body responses even in small amounts: 10<sup>-8</sup> ~ 10<sup>-12</sup> M

> ② Transported through the blood

> ③ Specific actions: Target cells of hormone responses possess receptors

>> ○ Sex hormones act on nearly all cells

> ④ Homeostasis maintenance: Feedback regulation, antagonism

>> ○ Sweating is controlled only by sympathetic nerves; no antagonism occurs.

>> ○ Hormone half-lives are generally shorter than 3 minutes to maintain homeostasis

> ⑤ Lack of species specificity: Hormones are crucial for homeostasis, thus evolutionarily conserved

 ⑷ Classification of hormones

> ① Receptor hormones

>> ○ Pathway: Cell membrane receptors **→** Signal transduction cascade **→** Enzyme activation ⇢ Gene expression and protein synthesis

>> ○ Pre-synthesized and stored

>> ○ Amine hormones (excluding thyroxine) and peptide hormones

>> ○ Act much faster than lipid-soluble hormones

> ② Lipid-soluble hormones

>> ○ Pathway: Bound to plasma carrier proteins, transported to tissues → Receptor inside the cytoplasm **→** Gene expression

>> ○ Synthesized and secreted as needed

>> ○ Steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, nitric oxide (NO), adrenal cortex hormones

> ③ Peptide hormones

>> ○ Pre-synthesized and stored

>> ○ Preprohormone: a peptide hormone synthesized in the ribosome but not yet processed.

>> ○ Prohormone: a peptide hormone in which the N-signal has been cleaved in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

>> ○ When prohormone is processed in the Golgi apparatus, it becomes the final active form

>> ○ Example: FSH, LH, insulin, etc.

> ④ Amine hormones

>> ○ Insulin, histamine, catecholamines, calcitonin, melatonin, serotonin

>> ○ Catecholamines: A group of hormones derived from tyrosine (e.g., dopamine, thyroxine, epinephrine, norepinephrine); pre-synthesized and stored

>> ○ Thyroxine: Lipid-soluble, pre-synthesized and stored, bound to plasma carrier proteins and delivered to target tissues

> ⑤ Steroid hormones

>> ○ Derived from cholesterol

>> ○ Synthesized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum as needed.

>> ○ Bound to plasma carrier proteins and delivered to target tissues

>> ○ Named with endings like -rone, -sol, -gen

>>> ○ An autoimmune disease that produces anti-TSH receptor antibodies acting as receptor agonists.

>>> ○ Thyroid hormones continue to be secreted from the thyroid gland even when their levels increase.

>>> ○ The type of anti-TSH receptor antibody is IgG.

>>> ○ Also known as Basedow's disease

>> ○ **Example 2.** Goiter (Thyroid Enlargement): Reduced iodine intake **→** ↑ hypothalamic stimulation **→** Enlarged thyroid gland

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Small intestine: Calcitriol, as active vitamin D, promotes calcium absorption

>>>> ○ Active vitamin D promotes the creation of calcium-binding proteins, increasing calcium absorption and concentration in the blood
