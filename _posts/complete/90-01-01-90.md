## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ Functions

> ① Body support

> ② Protection of internal organs

> ③ Providing links for movement and muscle attachment

> ④ Mineral storage: calcium, phosphorus storage

> ⑤ Blood cell production in bone marrow

 ⑵ Classification of Skeleton

> ① Hydrostatic skeleton: Formed inside the body when muscles compress a cavity filled with an incompressible fluid.

>> ○ Examples: coelenterates (sea anemones), squids and octopuses (jet propulsion), earthworm locomotion

>> ○ **Earthworm Locomotion:**

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Contraction of the longitudinal muscles and relaxation of the circular muscles in the head and tail segments make them short and thick; their setae anchor to the ground. The remaining segments, with relaxed longitudinal muscles and contracted circular muscles, become long and slender.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Contraction of the circular muscles in the head region pushes the head forward. The segments just behind the head and those toward the rear become thick, contact the ground, and anchor, preventing the worm from slipping backward.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The anterior segments thicken again and anchor at the new position, while the posterior segments lift off the ground and are pulled forward.

> ② Exoskeleton: A hard shell that forms the outer part of the body, with muscles attached.

>> ○ Examples: Mollusca, arthropods.

> ③ Endoskeleton: Internal structures that support the body, with muscles attached and acting upon them.

>> ○ Example: Human skeleton

 ⑶ Human Skeleton (Endoskeleton)

> ① Composition

>> ○ 206 bones in total

>> ○ Main Skeleton: Spinal column, skull, rib cage.

>> ○ Appendicular Skeleton: Joints, shoulders, limb bones.

**Figure 2.** Structure of Functional Segments 

<br>

>>> ○ Front Part of Functional Segment: Consists of vertebral body, intervertebral disc, longitudinal ligament.

>>> ○ Back Part of Functional Segment: Consists of vertebral arch, intervertebral joint, various processes, various ligaments.

>>> ○ Intervertebral Disc: Physical cushioning action. Disc bears about 1.5 times its external load. Load borne by the disc increases towards the tail end.

>>> ○ Ligaments (excluding yellow ligaments): High collagen content that limits spinal elongation.

>>> ○ Yellow Ligaments: High elasticity. Always under tension. Induces contraction during spinal stretching.

>> ○ **Disorder 1:** Herniated Disc: Condition where intervertebral discs between vertebrae rupture. May compress the spinal cord and cause pain.

>>> ○ Cervical Disc: Herniation in cervical vertebrae.

>>> ○ Lumbar Disc: Herniation in lumbar vertebrae.

>> ○ **Disorder 2:** Spinal Stenosis: Narrowing of the canal through which nerves pass in the spinal cord. Causes pain and other neurological symptoms.

>>> ○ Often more severe than herniated disc. In contrast to herniated discs, spinal stenosis is often not covered by insurance.

> ③ Sexual Differences in Skeletal Structure

>> ○ Sex hormones influence skeletal and muscle development. Sex differences in physical performance become evident during puberty.

>>> ○ Females experience puberty earlier, resulting in taller stature during this period.

>>> ○ The later puberty begins, the more likely growth will continue for a longer period.

>> ○ On average, males have longer limbs than females, resulting in a 15 cm height difference.

>>> ○ Longer arms and legs in males result in greater leverage and force.

>>> ○ Females have a lower center of gravity, leading to better balance (e.g., rhythmic gymnastics).

>> ○ Q Angle

>>> ○ Definition: Angle formed between the femur and the tibia (load direction).

>>> ○ Male Q Angle: 12°, Female Q Angle: 16°.

>>> ○ Females have a larger Q angle, which can contribute to knee injuries upon landing.

>>> ○ Diameter: 20-100 μm.

>>> ○ A type of monocyte-macrophage within white blood cells.

>>> ○ Mononuclear osteoclasts transform into multinuclear osteoclasts (with around 50 giant nuclei) and adhere to bone surfaces, secreting lysosomal enzymes for bone resorption.

>> ○ **Component 2:** Osteoblast

>>> ○ Forms bone (osteocyte) and removes calcium from the blood.

>>> ○ Also known as bone-forming cells.

>> ○ Lamellar Bone

>>> ○ Begins forming after the first year of birth.

>>> ○ Replaces woven bone as mature bone tissue.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Embryonic development stage: All bones are composed of cartilage.

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Phase of Bone Formation

>> ○ Primary ossification centers develop within the center of cartilage, starting the process of ossification.

>> ○ Bone differentiation markers: alkaline phosphate (_in vitro_; 7 ~ 10 days) → osteopontin → osteonectin → osteocalcin (_in vitro_; 3 weeks)

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Secondary ossification center formation

>> ○ When sufficient ossification has progressed from the primary ossification center, a new bone-forming center (secondary ossification center) appears at the ends of the bone.

>> ○ Osteoconductive: the conduction of bone cells into adjacent areas.

>> ○ Osteoinductive: the ability to induce the formation of bone tissue by itself.

> ⑤ 4<sup>th</sup>. Epiphyseal (growth) plate closure

>> ○ Under hormonal influence, osteoblast precursors proliferate faster than chondroblasts, causing the epiphyseal growth plate between the two ossification centers to close → cessation of longitudinal growth.

>>> ○ **Structure 3.** Hypertrophic zone: chondrocytes enlarge, secrete matrix, then die.

>>> ○ **Structure 4.** Ossification: calcified bone tissue replaces cartilage.

>> ○ Morphogens and the growth plate

>>> ○ PTHrP (Parathyroid hormone–related protein): Promotes formation of the resting zone; endows chondrocytes with proliferative capacity; prevents premature hypertrophy (by suppressing excessive activation of GDF5 and BMP).

>>> ○ IHH (Indian hedgehog): Produced by hypertrophic chondrocytes; increases PTHrP expression in the resting zone; helps balance proliferation and differentiation.

>>> ○ GDF5 (Growth differentiation factor 5): Contributes to chondrogenesis; a member of the BMP family; expressed in the perichondrium and the peripheral growth plate; acts on proliferating chondrocytes to promote growth.

>>> ○ BMP (Bone morphogenetic protein): When overactivated, induces premature hypertrophy.

## **3. Mechanical Connections of Bones**

 ⑴ Joints: Connections between bones

> ① Immovable Joints

>> ○ Fibrous Joints

>>> ○ Formed by collagen and elastic fibers; three types: syndesmosis (ligamentous joint), suture, and gomphosis (peg-and-socket).

>>> ○ A representative example of a suture is the cranial (skull) sutures.

>> ○ Cartilaginous Joints

>>> ○ **Type 1:** Synchondrosis (primary cartilaginous joint) — the union is formed by hyaline cartilage.

>>> ○ **Type 2:** Symphysis — a fibrocartilaginous union.

>> ○ Because the vertebral column allows limited motion, it is sometimes classified as an amphiarthrosis.

> ② Movable Joints: Typical joints

>> ○ Subdivided into synovial, plane, hinge, pivot, ellipsoid (condyloid), saddle, and ball-and-socket joints.

>> ○ Synovial joint: opposing articular cartilages + synovial fluid + joint capsule.

>> ○ Ball-and-socket joint: a joint that moves about three axes.

>>> ○ Examples: the shoulder (where the humerus meets the scapula), the hip (where the femur meets the pelvis); also called a spheroidal/cotyloid joint.

>> ○ Hinge joint: a joint that moves about one axis.

>>> ○ Examples: the humeroulnar part of the elbow; the knee joint.

>> ○ Pivot joint: a joint that can rotate around its long axis.

>>> ○ Examples: the proximal radioulnar joint at the elbow; rotation in the neck at the atlanto-axial (axle) joint.

> ③ **Synovial Joint** (Articular Cartilage): Representative movable joint

>> ○ Considered a heterogeneous material: interstitial fluid form (incompressible, non-miscible) + solid form (porous, permeable).

>> ○ The space between opposing articular surfaces is about 100 nm.

>> ○ **Component 2.** [Proteoglycan](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1389)

>>> ○ Large glycoproteins composed of a core protein with several glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached.

>>> ○ Compression → proteoglycans deform and expel interstitial fluid → fixed charge density rises, increasing resistance.

>>> ○ Donnan osmotic swelling pressure: compression → aggrecans cluster, increasing negative charge density → water is drawn in and the tissue swells (edema).

>> ○ Epitenon: Avascular. Contains tenocytes and promotes tendon gliding through synovial fluid.

> ③ Ligaments and tendons have minimal blood supply, leading to slow wound healing.
