## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ Functions

> ① Body support

> ② Protection of internal organs

> ③ Providing links for movement and muscle attachment

> ④ Mineral storage: calcium, phosphorus storage

> ⑤ Blood cell production in bone marrow

 ⑵ Classification of Skeleton

> ① Hydrostatic skeleton: Formed inside the body when muscles compress a cavity filled with an incompressible fluid.

>> ○ Examples: coelenterates (sea anemones), squids and octopuses (jet propulsion), earthworm locomotion

>> ○ **Earthworm Locomotion:**

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Contraction of the longitudinal muscles and relaxation of the circular muscles in the head and tail segments make them short and thick; their setae anchor to the ground. The remaining segments, with relaxed longitudinal muscles and contracted circular muscles, become long and slender.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Contraction of the circular muscles in the head region pushes the head forward. The segments just behind the head and those toward the rear become thick, contact the ground, and anchor, preventing the worm from slipping backward.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The anterior segments thicken again and anchor at the new position, while the posterior segments lift off the ground and are pulled forward.

> ② Exoskeleton: A hard shell that forms the outer part of the body, with muscles attached.

>> ○ Examples: Mollusca, arthropods.

> ③ Endoskeleton: Internal structures that support the body, with muscles attached and acting upon them.

>> ○ Example: Human skeleton

 ⑶ Human Skeleton (Endoskeleton)

> ① Composition

>> ○ 206 bones in total

>> ○ Main Skeleton: Spinal column, skull, rib cage.

>> ○ Appendicular Skeleton: Joints, shoulders, limb bones.

**Figure 2.** Structure of Functional Segments 

<br>

>>> ○ Front Part of Functional Segment: Consists of vertebral body, intervertebral disc, longitudinal ligament.

>>> ○ Back Part of Functional Segment: Consists of vertebral arch, intervertebral joint, various processes, various ligaments.

>>> ○ Intervertebral Disc: Physical cushioning action. Disc bears about 1.5 times its external load. Load borne by the disc increases towards the tail end.

>>> ○ Ligaments (excluding yellow ligaments): High collagen content that limits spinal elongation.

>>> ○ Yellow Ligaments: High elasticity. Always under tension. Induces contraction during spinal stretching.

>> ○ **Disorder 1:** Herniated Disc: Condition where intervertebral discs between vertebrae rupture. May compress the spinal cord and cause pain.

>>> ○ Cervical Disc: Herniation in cervical vertebrae.

>>> ○ Lumbar Disc: Herniation in lumbar vertebrae.

>> ○ **Disorder 2:** Spinal Stenosis: Narrowing of the canal through which nerves pass in the spinal cord. Causes pain and other neurological symptoms.

>>> ○ Often more severe than herniated disc. In contrast to herniated discs, spinal stenosis is often not covered by insurance.

> ③ Sexual Differences in Skeletal Structure

>> ○ Sex hormones influence skeletal and muscle development. Sex differences in physical performance become evident during puberty.

>>> ○ Females experience puberty earlier, resulting in taller stature during this period.

>>> ○ The later puberty begins, the more likely growth will continue for a longer period.

>> ○ On average, males have longer limbs than females, resulting in a 15 cm height difference.

>>> ○ Longer arms and legs in males result in greater leverage and force.

>>> ○ Females have a lower center of gravity, leading to better balance (e.g., rhythmic gymnastics).

>> ○ Q Angle

>>> ○ Definition: Angle formed between the femur and the tibia (load direction).

>>> ○ Male Q Angle: 12°, Female Q Angle: 16°.

>>> ○ Females have a larger Q angle, which can contribute to knee injuries upon landing.
